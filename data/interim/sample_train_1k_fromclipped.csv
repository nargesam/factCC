Researchers in Australia have made the first steps towards bringing the frog, which was certified extinct in 1983, back to life, but the Lazarus Project - a 'de-extinction initiative' - is hopeful that many other species can be re-introduced to be studied by scientists. The process of de-extinction is more complex than cloning living animals, but a group of scientists believe humans have the ability and obligation to repair the damage they have done to the planet, which has led to countless types of animals dying out. An effort is underway in Australia to resurrect the southern gastric-brooding frog (pictured), which swallowed fertilised eggs and gave birth orally, before the last known female died in captivity in 1983. Scientists had been fascinated by the creatures but before they could study them in detail, the frogs died out Stem cell scientist Sir Ian Wilmut who is best known for cloning the world's first mammal, Dolly the sheep, thinks modern techniques could be used to create a replica of the prehistoric animal. Sir Ian said told The Guardian: 'I've always been very sceptical about the whole idea, but it dawned on me that if you could clear the first hurdle of getting viable cells from mammoths, you might be able to do something useful and interesting.' 'I think it should be done as long as we can provide great care for the animal. If there are reasonable prospects of them being healthy, we should do it. We can learn a lot about them.' Samples from 'Yuka' the mammoth who lived 39,000-years-ago have been sent to laboratories in South Korea and Russian researchers hope to clone her. The source of viable mammoth cells could come from  a number of frozen bodies discovered in the Siberian permafrost in recent years. However, Sir Ian is not terribly optimistic about the scientist's chances at present as there are many technical challenges to overcome. An effort is underway in Australia to resurrect the southern gastric-brooding frog, which swallowed fertilised eggs and gave birth orally, before the last known female died in captivity in 1983. Scientists had been fascinated by the creatures, which seemed to disappear from the forests of Queensland every year and were thought to be hibernating, but before they could study them in detail, the frogs died out, M.R. O'Connor said in an article for Salon.com. Luckily,samples of the frogs had been frozen and scientists are now using a cloning technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer to try and resurrect them. Researchers at the University of New South Wales removed the nuclei from eggs of a closely related living frog species and replaced it with the extinct species' cells and in spring the eggs reached the early embryonic stage. Mike Archer, a professor of paleobiology and a member of the Lazarus Project, told the publication: 'We are watching Lazarus arise from the dead, step by exciting step. We’ve reactivated dead cells into living ones and revived the extinct frog’s genome in the process.' It is not just Australian scientists who are pinning their hopes on de-extinction techniques. Four years ago researchers in Spain managed to produce a baby Pyrenean Ibex (like the one pictured) - extinct since 2000 - born of a domestic goat, but unfortunately the animal died soon after birth He said he is confident any problems are technological and not biological. It is not just Australian scientists who are pinning their hopes on de-extinction techniques. Four years ago researchers in Spain managed to produce a baby Pyrenean Ibex born of a domestic goat but unfortunately the animal died soon after birth. The species has been extinct since 2000. Scientists at the University of California are sequencing the genome of the passenger pigeon, which died out in 1914, with other groups setting their sites on doing similar work on the extinct Californian monk seal, Carolina parakeet and Tasmanian tiger. But perhaps the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Korea has embarked on the ambitious and high profile de-extinction project as it is working to reintroduce the woolly mammoth. However, opinion is divided as to whether such science is responsible. Scientists in favour of the practice believe it could un-do human wrongs against the planet. Scientists are sequencing the genome of the passenger pigeon (pictured), which died out in 1914, and others are planning similar work on the extinct Tasmanian tiger. Environmentalist Stuart Brand believes humans have the ability and the moral obligation, to repair any damage they have caused to the planet Environmentalist Stuart Brand, who is co-founder of the Revive and Restore Foundation (another de-extinction project) told Salon: 'Humans have made a huge hole in nature, we have the ability, maybe the moral obligation, to repair that damage.' However, other scientists think advances in the field could actually damage current conservation efforts and could potentially make more animals extinct. A number of researchers attending a summit at Stanford University to debate the ethics of de-extinction were reportedly concerned the ability to litterally put extinct species on ice, could become standard pracitice instead of trying to protect current animals at risk of extinction living in the wild. Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, reportedly said that she believes politicians would take advantage of de-extinction technology to undermine species conservation. Professor Ronald Sandler from Northwestern University said de-extinction is not guaranteed to preserve a species or solve the problem of its habitat being damaged by humans. He warned that the southern gastric-brooding frog could be resurrected and reintroduced only to find that the forest streams it needs to stay alive, have run dry. The Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Korea has embarked on the ambitious de-extinction project of reintroducing the woolly mammoth to Earth but there are ethical concerns about re-introducing an animal into an alien environment"

Jan Zijderveld, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate's president of Europe, said there was a clear demand from consumers for ""green"" products. ""What they want is products from a company where they know that the company makes the products responsibly,"" he said. ""When they buy PG Tips they know that the tea is grown from sustainable plantations, they know that the way we make it and produce is in the most responsible (way) possible."" He said the days were gone when consumers were driven by low prices alone. ""The funny thing is that for the consumer, 'good value' doesn't necessarily mean 'cheap.'"" He rejected the suggestion that Unilever's environmental focus was simply ""greenwashing,"" saying it was ""part of our European heritage to build a decent business that is rooted in society and does the right thing."" While cynics might doubt the company's ability to make good on ambitious plans to double the business while halving its environmental footprint, he believed Unilever could be a world-leading example of corporate responsibility. ""We will prove to the world that this is the right plan and this is also the right sustainable plan for business.""

""As a global enterprise we really have to look at where the opportunities are, and that is where the people are, where the population growth is, where the economies are growing and the consumption is still low,"" he said. He saw opportunities for the future in Russia, China, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh, as well as in African markets, ""because in many of these countries the consumption is lower, they are not consuming many of the fast-moving consumer goods we sell."" The emerging markets compared favorably to Europe in their attitudes toward business, he said ""The environment is much more pro-business ... they understand that business is a force for good. Business generates new products, it generates jobs, it pays taxes,"" he said. ""It is a lot easier to do business in the emerging world -- it is a lot more proactive, it is less bureaucratic."" He felt there was ""too much negativism"" towards business in Europe, and said he would like to see a cultural and policy shift to create a more dynamic, innovative business sector. ""To get the innovation through takes too long, to get approvals through takes too long, so things are just too slow and too bureaucratic,"" he said. ""If we want to reinvent this continent and make it creative, growing and dynamic, you need to loosen it up a little, give it some fresh air ... Europe needs a little bit of a spring clean to be able to innovate again and grow again."""

The primary cast of the film, as well as director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and book author Veronica Roth, spoke about the film's potential as the so-called next ""Hunger Games"" and offered hints about what's to come from the franchise. The futuristic film stars Shailene Woodley as a teenager named Tris who is forced to decide between the societal faction her family belongs to and the one she feels is right for her. It will be released in theaters on March 21, 2014. Woodley, who finished filming only two days prior to Comic-Con, is already preparing for the wash of fame that will follow should the movie be a success. Harrison Ford talks 'Ender's Game' ""I did audition for 'The Hunger Games' back in the day,"" Woodley told reporters at a press conference on Thursday, July 18. ""Jennifer Lawrence actually helped me with 'Divergent' because I asked her to tell me how her life has changed from going from small indie movies to something as big as 'Hunger Games.' And she gave me really beautiful advice saying how much she appreciated it and how much it's changed her life in positive ways. She really helped me on this journey."" The actress cited filming the book's integral scene on Chicago's famous Navy Pier -- Ferris wheel as her favorite moment in the film -- as well as one of her favorite moments in her life. The big-budget, action-based picture is a far cry from some of Woodley's previous roles, which include ""The Descendents"" and next month's ""The Spectacular Now."" For the actress and her co-stars, many of whom are largely unknown actors, ""Divergent"" was a chance to experience new methods of filmmaking. ""Green-screen acting is by far way more difficult than human interaction,"" Woodley said. ""I'd never done a movie of this scale before with themes that are somewhat different than the world we live in today. So it was challenging for me I found because I had to erase my previous notions of acting, which is generally reacting off of somebody else, and create a new world and adapt my style of artistry to what we were doing."" An adaptation of the series' second book, ""Insurgent,"" is expected for 2015. Roth said she has been present on set and feels that the film remains true to her original text. The author confirmed that the final book, ""Allegiant,"" will be written from two perspectives: Tris and her love interest Four, who is played in the film by Theo James. But since the third book in the series will be released October 22, 2013, the actors and filmmakers still don't know the final fate of the characters. ""Not everyone on this panel lives,"" said Miles Teller, who plays Peter, as he motioned to the 10 cast members at the press conference. ""But I'm excited."" 'Kick-Ass 2': Not your average sequel"

The story of Mr Zhao's selflessness is likely to be held up as an example of community spirit by the Chinese media, in contrast to a wave of stories demonstrating the increasing individualism of the country's society. In 2011, a little girl who was run over by two cars was seen on camera bleeding to death while nearly 20 passers-by simply ignored her plight.

They take the whole process so seriously that they spend all year prepping and programming the lights, spend two months setting up and are known as local celebrities thanks to their display. Giving them a run for their money is the Downs family from Oklahoma. The Downs family Christmas display is one of the largest musically synchronized displays in the country. The display has become such a spectacle that an average of 20,000 cars attend each year and on Christmas Eve last year, they had close to 5,000 cars driving by.

The photos - some of which are sexually suggestive - were obtained under public records laws Thursday by The Associated Press, and revealed on Thursday - three years to the day after Mrs Powell went missing. Authorities uncovered the files while serving a search warrant last year at the home where her husband, Josh Powell, and father-in-law, Steven Powell, were living. Images: Thousands of pictures seized from the home of Susan Powell's father-in-law show the missing Utah mother as she walks in public and sits in her car - apparently unaware that someone is taking her picture Father and son: The files were uncovered in a home shared by Steven Powell, pictured right, and his son Josh, pictured left Josh Powell killed himself and the couple's two young children earlier this year. Some of the images seized during the search, including those of bathing young girls who lived next door to Steven Powell, were used earlier this year to convict him of voyeurism charges. Other photos show a variety of women, apparently unaware that a camera is focused on them, as they walk along sidewalks, at the park or into the mall. Convicted: Steven Powell was found guilty of voyeurism and child porn charges in September Steven Powell was not charged with any crimes related to images of Susan Powell, but the files show she was often the focus of his lens. In a folder labeled with her initials, SMP, there are images of her walking through parking lots or sitting in her car. It appears the photographer is taking the pictures from another vehicle. Some images zoom closely to Susan Powell's crotch or her backside, including a set of photos taken through blinds as she's bending over and doing laundry. None of the pictures, which were found on a disc in Steven Powell's bedroom, show her naked. The folder dedicated to Susan Powell contains nearly 4,500 images. In journals that authorities have also made public, Powell describes himself as a 'voyeur' and Susan as an 'exhibitionist.' He talks about using a mirror to spy on her under the bathroom door, and he writes about taking sexual pleasure in looking at images of Susan Powell that he kept on his computer. Powell talks in his journals about taking lots of video of Susan during a trip to Silver Falls in 2009, and a folder of images from the trip shows only photos of her backside as she's walking. In one entry, dated a few months before Susan Powell disappeared, Steven Powell wrote that he had just woken up 'from a most pleasant dream about Susan.' He described a sexually charged dream in which Susan asked him, 'Do you think I would make a good wife for you?' Anne Bremner, an attorney who represents Susan Powell's parents, said the images support the family's assertion that Steven Powell had a concerning attraction for his daughter-in-law. Mother: Mrs Powell, pictured with her sons Charlie and Braden, has not been seen in three years 'When you look at those pictures, it's clearly surreptitious. It's clearly obsessive,' Bremner said. The family believes Steven Powell knows something about Susan Powell's disappearance, and authorities have described him as uncooperative. Mark Quigley, an attorney who represented Steven Powell in the voyeurism case, did not return a call seeking comment. Powell is in prison, serving a sentence of more than two years. Susan Powell disappeared in Utah in December 2009. Records have shown that Utah investigators handling the case focused their attention primarily on her husband.

Officials admitted yesterday they are ‘powerless’ to throw out Najat Mostafa, the hook-handed cleric’s second wife, from the five-bedroom property in an exclusive west London street. Hammersmith and Fulham Council, which pays her rent, asked her to downsize last year after discovering that only two of the couple’s seven children were living there with her. Exclusive: The home of Abu Hamza's wife Najat Mostafa in Shepherd's Bush, London, is the only council-owned house in a street favoured by lawyers and bankers Terrorism charges: The hook-handed radical cleric was deported to the US to face charges last year But it said it had changed its mind after recently carrying out an audit and discovering that two more of her children have since moved back into the house, meaning she is no longer classed as ‘under-occupying’. The local authority declined to reveal the ages of the children or how much rent is payable for what is the only council property in the street in Shepherd’s Bush, an area popular with bankers and City lawyers. Hamza also has a son from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1984, and has never officially lived in the home. His Moroccan-born wife moved into the large property in 1995 after claiming that the couple had separated. But neighbours said the hate preacher was often seen at the house until his arrest in August 2004 over allegations of incitement to murder and racial hatred. Mrs Mostafa has received thousands of pounds in benefits during her time living there and the house has twice been refurbished during the past decade, costing taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds. Hamza was extradited to the United States to face terrorism charges last year, having delayed his deportation in the courts since 2004. He is accused of hostage-taking in Yemen and supporting attempts to set up an Al Qaeda training camp in the US. Large family: Hamza has seven children with Mrs Mostafa The cleric, infamous for his firebrand preaching against Britain and the West at North London’s Finsbury Park mosque, was previously jailed in Britain in 2006 for incitement to murder and racial hatred. Mrs Mostafa lives next door to former work and pensions secretary Lord Hutton, who declined to comment on the row over the house. But another neighbour, who described himself as retired but would not give his name, said: ‘It is ironic that she is living next door to the man who gave them so many handouts. ‘I am not happy she is here. She is very reclusive, she does not mix with neighbours. You see her walk down the street at quite a pace. ‘Nobody knows how many children are living there.’ A spokesman for Hammersmith and Fulham Council said: ‘We found that she is no longer under-occupying and she is living perfectly adequately in the property with the right number of children living there. ‘The council has no power or ability to tell her, or even ask her, to leave because she is not under-occupying.’ It is also unable to evict her as there is no time limit on her tenancy agreement. The council said that since she signed her lease, it had changed its policy and that all new tenancy agreements were limited to five years, so that tenants could be moved if their circumstances changed. Mrs Mostafa refused to comment. It emerged this week that radical cleric Abu Qatada has complained that his taxpayer-funded house is not big enough for his wife and their five children."

""When I hear of Hillary's prospective candidacy, I cannot help but fear the next wave of paparazzi,"" she said in the upcoming issue of Vanity Fair. ""Like many Americans, I've been thinking about Hillary Clinton. What might happen, I've wondered, if she does run in 2016. And what if she wins -- and then wins a second term?"" she said. ""But when I think about these matters, there's a dimension at play for me other than just the fact that we might finally have a women in the White House,"" said Lewinsky. 'Burn the beret...' Her comments were taken from the full article that's due out on Thursday. It's the first time she's written about her affair with Bill Clinton, who was impeached over the resulting scandal. The Senate acquitted him of all charges. In excerpts released on Tuesday, Lewinsky, now 40, said the sexual relationship with Clinton while working as an intern in the mid-1990s was consensual and it was time to move on. ""It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress,"" she wrote, noting that she ""deeply"" regretted what occurred. ""Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,"" Lewinsky wrote. Wary of the next wave of stories While Lewinsky remained in the public eye for a number of years after the controversy, she said little about the scandal over the past decade. As the former first lady considers running for president, Lewinsky worries about how the potential campaign could affect her. In addition to ""paparazzi,"" Lewinsky also is wary of ""the next wave of 'where is she now?' stories, the next reference to me in Fox News coverage of the primaries. I've begun to find it debilitating to plot out the cycle of my life based, to some degree, on the political calendar. For me, it's a scenario in which the personal and political are impossible to separate,"" Lewinsky wrote. When Hillary Clinton ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, Lewinsky said that she ""remained virtually reclusive, despite being inundated with press requests."" 'Gun-shy yet again' She writes that she also put off announcing several media projects in 2012 until after that year's presidential election. ""And recently I've found myself gun-shy yet again, fearful of 'becoming an issue' should she decide to ramp up her campaign. But should I put my life on hold for another 8 to 10 years?"" Lewinsky asked. But she added that it was time to stop ""tiptoeing around my past -- and other people's futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story. I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past. (What this will cost me, I will soon find out.)"" Lewinsky was constantly in the media during and shortly after the controversy. Handbags and grad school She sold a line of handbags in 1999 and the next year she appeared in commercials for diet company Jenny Craig. In 2002, she appeared in an HBO special on the affair, and the next year she hosted a reality dating program. Lewinsky changed course in 2005, moving to Britain to obtain a master's degree in social psychology at the London School of Economics. She's stayed out of the spotlight since. In the Vanity Fair article, Lewinsky responds to reports made public in February that Hillary Clinton, in correspondence with close friend Diane Blair during the 1990s, had characterized Lewinsky as a ""narcissistic loony toon."" Lewinsky writes that her first thought was: ""If that's the worst thing she said, I should be so lucky."" She continued, ""Mrs. Clinton, I read, had supposedly confided to Blair that, in part, she blamed herself for her husband's affair (by being emotionally neglectful) and seemed to forgive him. Although she regarded Bill as having engaged in 'gross inappropriate behavior,' the affair was, nonetheless, 'consensual (was not a power relationship).'"" Blair's personal writings gave insight into the former first lady's views on the Lewinsky scandal, as well as a host of other issues. The papers were donated by Blair's family to the University of Arkansas. Asked about those conversations between Hillary Clinton and Blair, Lewinsky writes: ""Yes, I get it. Hillary Clinton wanted it on record that she was lashing out at her husband's mistress. She may have faulted her husband for being inappropriate, but I find her impulse to blame the Woman -- not only me, but herself -- troubling."" And she rejects the ""narcissistic loony toon"" label, saying that she refused to cooperate with interrogators offering the then-24-year-old immunity from the threat of jail time in return for wearing a wire to monitor staged conversations with two of Clinton's confidantes. ""Courageous or foolish, maybe,"" Lewinsky writes, ""but narcissistic and loony?"" The full article will appear in the June issue of Vanity Fair, which will be available in New York and Los Angeles and on the iPhone, iPad, Nook, and Kindle -- on Thursday. The magazine will hit national newsstands on May 13. Clintons' relationship with media still testy after all these years In political extramarital affairs, the mistress rarely emerges unscathed"

After another defeat in the Barclays Premier League - their seventh of the season - the Liverpool captain could not get out of this place quick enough. Last March, when the club were challenging for the title, he scored twice in a 3-0 victory here at Old Trafford to maintain the momentum. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's player ratings: Manchester United 3-0 Liverpool Liverpool tweeted the above image of Steven Gerrard's shirt and armband before the game kicked off Liverpool captain Gerrard (left) reacts as Wayne Rooney (centre) puts Manchester United ahead Gerrard (left) looks on as  United's players celebrate Robin van Persie's goal to make it 3-0 to the home side Gerrard holds his head in his hands as Liverpool sank to another Premier League defeat at Old Trafford On Sunday he looked up to the heavens at the final whistle and appeared to be pleading for help. Is this really happening? Afraid so, Stevie. Brendan Rodgers will tell you that his team dominated possession and should have got something out of Liverpool’s biggest game of the season. The body language of the players will tell you differently. This is a dysfunctional mob, a group of players slung together over the summer and asked to repeat last season’s extraordinary feats. There is no chance of that now, not after the manner and the conviction of this defeat by their oldest rivals in English football. Who knows what Liverpool are aiming for now and it will only be magnified when the draw for the last 32 of the Europa League takes places again. They have the feel of a category B club again. This Liverpool dressing room is split, divided in their approach after failing to finish second behind Real Madrid in their Champions League group. ‘I wouldn’t tell if there have been issues, we keep that sort of thing internal,’ claimed Rodgers. It feels like it is out in the open anyhow. Liverpool’s defence was all over the place at times here, cowed into a corner by the brilliance of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and the extremely fortunate Juan Mata. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers reacts during his side's 3-0 defeat to Manchester United Raheem Sterling (left) was repeatedly denied by the excellent performance of David de Gea (right) Sterling crashed to the ground and looked devastated by the result as the full-time whistle was blown De Gea (left) managed to keep Mario Balotelli (right) waiting for his first Liverpool Premier League goal Here at Old Trafford we perhaps witnessed a Liverpool team look disaffected and done in for the first time in living memory. The decision to play Brad Jones ahead of Simon Mignolet - admittedly no great shakes this season - clearly disrupted the Liverpool defence. So did the switch to 3-4-3, without a main striker and a load of work on the training ground in the days leading up to the game. It was a mistake. Liverpool’s confidence is shot, summed up by the decision-making and their failure to show any sign of cohesion or spirit out there. At 20, Raheem Sterling believes he has earned a contract on a par with the big boys after a decent finish to last season that ended with a place in the England squad. Talented boy he is, but he was denied three times here by Manchester United’s brilliant keeper David de Gea. On each occasion, you backed de Gea. Brad Jones, brought in to replace Simon Mignolet in goal, was wrong-footed when Rooney put United in to an early lead. He never recovered. Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones (left) replaced Simon Mignolet but had a torrid afternoon for Liverpool Balotelli could have had a hat-trick for Liverpool but was denied brilliantly three times by De Gea Rooney (left), who scored United's first goal, protects the ball from the attention of Gerrard (right) Neither did Gerrard, the man caught out of position when he was dragged to the ball by the sight of Antonio Valencia bounding down the right wing. Rooney, his opposite number for the day in the boiler room, swept in United’s first. After that there was no way back for Liverpool. What has happened to Gerrard? He is a tormented soul again, wishing away the season after Rodgers confirmed again that his team is in transition. Even at the start of the second half, when you normally expect Gerrard to be showing some emotion and stirring his team-mates before kick-off, he was quiet and subdued. Then there was Mario Balotelli, brought on at the start of the second half to replace Adam Lallana. He could have had a hat-trick. He was denied, just like Sterling, by the brilliance of de Gea in United’s goal. Beating the Spaniard from close range is a formidable task these days. Marouane Fellaini (left) tussles for possession with Gerrard in the Premier League game at Old Trafford Gerrard cut a dejected figure as he walked off the pitch at Old Trafford following his side's 3-0 defeat to United After this it is all about saving Liverpool’s season and Rodgers must come up with some more answers this week. The trip to Dean Court on Wednesday for a Capital One Cup tie against Championship leaders Bournemouth is full of pitfalls. Eddie Howe’s team scored five against Cardiff and will fancy their chances of another scalp against Liverpool. After that it is on to Arsenal, the team they beat 5-1 at Anfield last season. This time, it feels like they are hanging on."

New figures today showed 87.3 per cent of families have at least one person earning in work, the highest since records began almost two decades ago. Ministers claimed the data was proof that welfare reforms are ensuring that people will always be better off in a job than claiming benefits. 87.3 per cent of families have at least one person earning in work, the highest since records began almost two decades ago Compared to 2008, the biggest rise has been among lone parent families finding work, the Office for National Statistics said The government insists that efforts to tackle so-called troubled families, where no-one works, have helped to tackle long-term unemployment. The Office for National Statistics found that 87.3 per cent of families were classified as working families, the highest since comparable records began in 1996. The biggest increase was among lone parent families with dependent children up from 57.4 per cent in 1996 to 71.1 per cent this year. In the 2million workless families, more than half (53.8 per cent) have had no one in work for three or more years. More than one in 10 children (12.6 per cent) were living in workless families, also the lowest percentage since records began in 1996. Thera er now almost 14million working families in the country, up from 12million in 1996, the figures show Parents of children under five were almost twice as likely to be in employment if they were in a couple (78.6 per cent) than if they were lone parents (40.9 per cent), the ONS said. Employment of single mothers was also at a high, hitting 62.3 per cent this year. Women were more likely to be in work if they had children than if they did not. Almost 70 per cent of women with dependent children have a job, compared to 67.5 per cent of women without children. Young mothers aged 16 to 24 were around half as likely to be in employment (36 per cent) as mothers aged 25 to 64 (71.6 per cent) in 2014. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the Government's welfare reforms were encouraging more people to work. He said: 'The benefits system this Government inherited was broken, often trapping the very people it was designed to help in cycles of worklessness and welfare dependency. 'We are reforming the system so that people are given the skills as well as the opportunities to get into work, with Universal Credit meaning that they can take employment safe in the knowledge that they will be better off than they would be on benefits. 'And our reforms are clearly working - with figures released today confirming that the proportion of families where no-one works is now at an all-time low. Furthermore, lone parent families have seen the biggest increases in employment rates and lone mothers now have the highest employment rate on record. 'As part of our long-term economic plan, we’ll be continuing to help people to break free from welfare dependency so they can look forward to a better more secure future for themselves and their families.'"

So it may seem strange to release the new ""Die Hard"" installment, ""A Good Day to Die Hard,"" on Valentine's Day. But for our money, it makes perfect sense. Where ""The Notebook"" is the gold standard for women, the original ""Die Hard"" is the ultimate romantic movie for men. Sound crazy? Stick with me. The 1988 original stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a sarcastic New York cop visiting his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and his two children in California. When he arrives at Holly's office Christmas party, the tension in their relationship is immediately evident. Holly is using her maiden name again and John doesn't even plan to stay with his family while he's in town. There's no doubt that John loves his wife and wants to rekindle the romance, but he can't seem to admit it. But while John proves incapable of communicating his feelings to his wife verbally, an opportunity arises allowing him to prove his devotion to her. Review: Willis goes through the motions in 'A Good Day to Die Hard' Midway through the party, a team of terrorists led by the stylish Hans Gruber (a scene-stealing Alan Rickman) interrupts the event and holds most of the attendees hostage. The quick-thinking John eludes their grasp and eventually begins taking down the bad guys one by one in order to rescue his captured wife. The story's subtext recognizes the stereotypical, but undeniable fact that many men aren't romantic or open with their emotions. Despite what many rom-coms and dramas suggest, a lot of guys don't picture themselves courting a woman by blasting a boombox outside a bedroom window, as is done in ""Say Anything."" (In fact, that's probably illegal in most states.) And forget ""Titanic."" Guys don't want to get the girl of their dreams by freezing in the ocean while keeping the one they love afloat on a piece of driftwood. (That plan doesn't actually work long-term, either.) Men often imagine winning a girl's affection by proving their worth in a battle against someone or something that threatens their loved one's life. While many women want the men in their lives to be sensitive like Ryan Gosling's ""Notebook"" character Noah, guys aspire to be like the renegade John McClane in ""Die Hard."" John offers a brand of masculinity and strength that men can look up to (akin to what John Wayne and Clint Eastwood once offered moviegoers). John doesn't back down and he never gives up. The cold and calculating Hans may mock John for his cowboy mentality, his freewheeling spirit and his assumed affection for masculine film actors of the past (like Wayne). But John doesn't care what Hans thinks. John just keeps killing bad guys. While separated from his wife, John shows his love for her by killing terrorists and trying to protect her. Compare that to Gosling's Noah: When he's separated from the girl he loves, he writes love letters. How does John send messages in ""Die Hard""? He writes notes on the sweatshirts of dead terrorists, and in one scene even throws a dead terrorist out a window to send a message to a passing police officer. That's how he communicates. The climactic scenes at the end of ""Die Hard"" prove why it's a perfect Valentine's Day flick for guys. There is no declaration of love between John and his wife. There is no grand romantic gesture that shows how much he cares for her. As the story concludes, John McClane â€” who has been shot, brutalized and cut by hundreds of pieces of glass â€” has proven his love for his wife by killing all the terrorists who threatened her. And with that, he gets the girl and they make out in the back seat of a limo. Now that's love."

Nearly all of Britain's troops in Iraq will have left by the week's end. The withdrawal marks the first time since the invasion of Iraq more than six years ago that there will be almost no British troops in the country. The only British troops there will be a group of about a dozen helping to train Iraqi police as part of a NATO mission, the ministry said. The United Kingdom's remaining contingent of 100 to 150 troops is leaving Iraq for neighboring Kuwait, a Ministry of Defence spokesman told CNN. He declined to be named in line with policy. ""The small handful of British military personnel operating in Iraq will be withdrawn to Kuwait after Iraq's parliament adjourned without passing a deal that would let them stay,"" the spokesman said. Iraq must give its permission for foreign troops to be on its soil. It was a group of Iraqi lawmakers loyal to anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr that prevented parliament from approving a new agreement on British troops. They walked out of parliament as a group on July 11, depriving the legislature of the minimum number of lawmakers necessary for votes to take place. Parliament is now on summer recess until September 8. Fawzi Akram, a lawmaker from the Sadr bloc, confirmed that the bloc reject the Iraqi-British security agreement. He said that Iraq does not need the British troops and that Iraqi security forces are ready to handle security on their own. Britain hopes the Iraqi parliament will eventually approve the security agreement. ""While this delay is unfortunate, we are continuing to seek a solution with the Iraqi Government that will provide our forces with the sound legal basis they need,"" the ministry said in a written statement. The British troops who are being pulled out include Royal Navy servicemen who have been helping the Iraqis to protect oil fields around the port town of Umm Qasr, according to the Ministry of Defence spokesman. All British combat troops have already left the country, another ministry spokesman told CNN. There were about 46,000 British troops in and around Iraq at the peak of major combat operations in March and April 2003, according to the Ministry of Defence. CNN's Jonathan Wald in London and Youssif Basil in Baghdad, Iraq, contributed to this report."

Now living under the name of Sheikh Abdullah and working as a traditional healer in the Shindand district of Herat Province in western Afghanistan, former Soviet soldier Bakhredtin Khakimov was an ethnic Uzbek. Khakimov was tracked down by a team from Warriors-Internationalists Affairs Committee, a nonprofit, Moscow-based organization that leads the search for the former Soviet Union's MIAs in Afghanistan. ""He received a heavy wound to the head in the course of a battle in (Shandand) district in September 1980 when he was picked up by local residents,"" the organization said in a statement posted on its website. ""He now leads a seminomadic life with the people who sheltered him."" The organization said it made contact with the man two weeks ago and, while he had no identity papers, he was able to positively identify photos of other Soviets who served at the time. ""He could understand Russian a little bit, but spoke it poorly, although he remembers his Uzbek language,"" the organization said. ""The effects of his wounds were clearly manifested: His hand trembles, and there is a visible tic in his shoulder."" The deputy head of the organization, Alexander Lavrentyev, told a news conference on Monday that Khakimov, originally from the city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan, was nursed back to health by a village elder. The elder was an herbal healer who taught him his trade, Lavrentyev said. ""He was just happy he survived,"" Lavrentyev was reported as saying by Russia's RIA news agency. Lavrentyev met with Khakimov in the city of Herat in late February, The former soldier -- who married in Afghanistan but is now a childless widower -- was keen to meet his relatives. That's something the committee is working to arrange, Lavrentyev told reporters. A chief of police in Ghor province, Dilwar Dilawar, told CNN Khakimov converted to Islam in 1993. Local reports, however, conflict with the Russian version of events. Local journalist Sharafudin Stanekzai, who spoke with Khakimov, told CNN that Khakimov separated from his unit after stealing a gun and then handed the weapon over to Mujahedeen Islamic guerrillas. The Warriors-Internationalists Affairs Committee is working to track down 263 Soviet soldiers whose fates are unknown after the bloody nine-year campaign in Afghanistan. So far, it says it has tracked down 29 missing Soviet soldiers. Lavrentyev said 22 chose to be repatriated to their homes while seven elected to stay in Afghanistan. About 15,000 of the 600,000 Soviet soldiers who served in the near decade-long war were killed, according to figures cited by RIA from the Soviet General Staff. Regarded as one of the last Cold War confrontations, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan on Christmas Eve 1979 to protect a Soviet-backed government against rebels armed and trained by Western and Islamic countries."

This category includes loss of life and those who sustained double amputations of limbs or permanent brain damage. Fourteen people in Category B will each receive $1,195,000. This category includes those who sustained a single amputation of a limb. Sixty-nine people in Category C will each receive between $125,000 and $948,300. This category includes those who were physically injured and hospitalized for one or more nights and they will receive their payments determined by length of hospital stay.

It took two-and-a-half hours. 1909 - Pilot Louis Bleriot became the first to cross the Channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft, the Bleriot XI monoplane. It took 37 minutes. 1979 - The first human-powered aircraft made it across. American Bryan Allen used pedal-power for his three-hour journey. 2003 - Austrian sky-diver Felix Baumgarter completed a 20-mile freefall using an aerodynamic 'wingsuit' and a carbon fin. He took 14 minutes. 2008 - Swiss daredevil Yves Rossy reached 220mph using a jet-powered 'wing', and completed the crossing in less than 10 minutes. 2010 - Cluster balloonist Jonathan Trappe used 54 giant helium balloons to drift across, remaining airborne for three hours. 2012 - Jonathan Trappe launched a house into the sky just like in the Disney movie 'Up'. At 2000m from the shoreline, he descended down to 400ft, and again at 1000m descend down to 200ft. As he neared the shore the South African-born manager at a medical device company, dropped a rope near the coastline and a sea rescue craft pulled him to safety. Mr Silver-Vallance wore a wetsuit and lifejacket as a precaution and a safety vessel accompanied the entire flight. A powered paraglider pilot also followed the entire flight to continually update the Air Traffic and Navigation Service (ATNS) based at Cape Town International Airport of the progress of the cluster-ballooning flight. In 2001, Mr Silver-Vallance joined a medical device company that sold surgical instruments, and the Red Cross Children’s Hospital became one of his clients. It became clear to him that the hospital was under enormous financial pressure, as the care provided, instruments purchased and staff salaries cost considerable amounts of money. After moving to Rugby in the UK he decided he wanted to raise funds for charity by doing something risky and bizarre that would grab people’s attention. It was then he decided to float from Robben Island to the mainland, carried by balloons, and has been planning the stunt since then. Victory: Matt Silver-Vallance throws his arms up in jubilation after completing the daring flight Sizing them up: Matt Silver-Vallance poses with balloons before embarking on his daring mission Mr Silver-Vallance co-ordinated the feat from the UK, engaging with international stakeholders and garnering support from around the world. He had hoped to raise $1 million for the hospital, but organizers of the charity event have not yet announced the final tally. On the fundraising website it says: 'This hospital addresses a great need; there are only four hospitals in Africa to serve nearly 450 million children. Millions of these children suffer from life-threatening illnesses and have little or no chance of receiving the specialised care they need.'"

People in the town of Shaqra contacted by phone said al Qaeda fighters drove out local tribesmen defending the town Wednesday. They told CNN that the militants now control the harbor at Shaqra and its fishing zone, the main source of income for the town. Shaqra is on the Arabian Sea some 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) to the east of Yemen's main port, and occupies a strategic position on the coastal road east toward Oman. ""The attacks happened quickly,"" said Abdul Salam Mansoor, a resident of Shaqra. ""One hour our government was in control and an hour later militants control everything."" Government officials in the capital, Sanaa, and in Abyan in the south declined to comment on the reports. But a local security official confirmed Shaqra was in the hands of the Islamists. All government buildings in the town had been taken, he said. The government was unprepared to fight, he said, and that was the reason the militants took over so quickly. ""The government is sending reinforcements to the town and hopes to retake it"" soon, he said The tribal militia defending the town had light artillery, but residents said a group of no more than 50 militants was able to seize Shaqra, along with the government artillery and equipment. Other residents said there was little fighting and the government had not used air support against the attacking Islamists. ""We are pretty sure the town was handed over to the militants like Zinjibar was in late May,"" Mansoor said. Zinjibar, the provincial capital 35 kilometers away, is still largely in the hands of Islamist militia fighters calling themselves Partisans of Sharia. Yemen's opposition has accused the government of allowing towns to fall to al Qaeda in an effort to show that the turmoil in the country is being exploited by Islamist extremists. Mansoor said he would try to leave Shaqra, fearing attacks by militants. At the end of last month there were several days of clashes around Shaqra between tribal fighters and militants. ""As soon as we controlled the city and kicked out the militants we handed the city to the Yemeni military,"" said Mohammed Abu Jalil, a tribal fighter in Abyan. The southern provinces of Yemen have seen growing activity by Islamist militant groups said to be affiliated with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula since unrest began across the country in February."

Mexican federal police patrol Monday on the streets of Ciudad Juarez, a major battleground for drug cartels. None of the dead were police or military officials, said Enrique Torres, a spokesman for the joint operation at the Cereso Estatal de Ciudad Juarez prison. Authorities called in 200 federal police agents and 50 army soldiers to help put down the riot; two helicopters and an airplane also were employed, he said. Victor Valencia de los Santos, spokesman for the state government of Chihuahua, told El Universal newspaper the fighting began when rival gangs clashed at the end of conjugal visits. El Universal identified the gangs as ""Los Artistas Asesinos,"" or the Assassin Artists, and the Aztecas drug gang. Police official Carlos Gonzalez told El Universal the fight was over control within the prison. The high-security prison houses many of the nation's most dangerous drug traffickers. The uprising started at 7 a.m. local time and was quelled two hours later, El Universal said. The prison is located in a semi-desert area 17 miles (28 kilometers) south of Ciudad Juarez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas. Juarez is one of the major battlegrounds as drug cartels fight each other and Mexican authorities.

Lions are quicker than elephants thank goodness and none of them were hurt. ‘Eventually the elephant herd calmed down and moved off to feed.

Special legal high clinics have been set up in Brighton in a bid to tackle the rise in use of the substances. Health and social care charity CRI - Crime Reduction Initiative - has opened the clinics, believed to be the first in the country, following the deaths of several young people. Brighton medical student Hester Stewart, 21, died in 2009 after taking the then legal drug GBL. Her mother Maryon Stewart has since set up the Angelus Foundation calling for more information about legal highs. CRI says the new access points will offer 'a range of services from advice and information to a full assessment and access to structured treatment' to help people kick their addiction. Michael Lawrence, who works at CRI, said: 'Novel psychoactive substances (NPS) otherwise known as ""legal highs"" or ""club drugs"" have changed the local drug scene hugely over the last year. 'The assumption people make is that because they are legal they must be safe, but that isn't the case. 'We hope that by setting up this new service we will encourage more people to seek advice prior to taking anything.'

Pictured is one of the centres The clinics have been opened in partnership with the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and are open two evenings a week to access as many people as possible Mr Lawrence added: 'We have seen many people come in shocked at the type of experience they have had with NPS, which has often lead them into risky situations, particularly if mixed with alcohol.

According to a friend, she had taken a liquid drug called GBL. At the time the drug was legal but it was banned in December 2009 following a spate of deaths. At the time of Hester's death, her mother Maryon Stewart, a well-known nutritionist who promotes natural health remedies, said that she felt 'cheated, frustrated and angry' that the Home Office had not acted on their promise made the previous August to ban the drug. Mrs Stewart has since set up the Angelus Foundation calling for more information about legal highs. 'We just don't know enough about the long term effects of any of the ""legal highs"" but even the short term effects can be extremely dangerous. 'We'd advise people not to start using these untested substances at all, but to be fully informed if you do choose to take them.' In August it was reported deaths involving legal highs increased by 80 per cent last year –  to one every week. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show fatalities relating to the psychoactive substances rose from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012 – compared to 22 in 2010. Drugs such as 'meow meow', 'Black Mamba' and 'Benzo Fury' were all legal when they were first produced, but have since been outlawed. However, banning the substances has had no effect on the number of deaths they have caused, which increased from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Reality struck, however, when the great white got closer to the surface and its tell-tale fin started protruding from the water. 'I saw one with a massive fin and said 'that’s not a dolphin', then he came up to the back of the boat and started having a go at the transducer and bait board,' fisherman Daniel Flemming told Australia's Nine Network news channel. 'When it first came up it was a bit daunting, it was a shark the same size as the boat and it pushed the boat around a couple of times,' he added. Confusion: Fisherman Daniel Flemming thought the massive great white shark may have been a dolphin at first. He realised he had made a mistake when the creature started attacking the outboard motor and bait board Visitors: Once the fishermen turned off their engines the shark calmed down and followed them as they drifted.

246322,cnn-train-a379713b74d31d9248944258326dd383e3816d11,The following is a transcript edited for reasons of length and clarity.,SUPPORTS,"[266, 276]",1.0,,,,cnndm/cnn/stories/a379713b74d31d9248944258326dd383e3816d11.story,"(CNN) -- David Zyla remembers when he was 5 years old and his parents were getting ready for a dinner party. He spied his mother reaching for a necklace, and he recommended that she wear a different one. Then he turned to his father and boldly suggested he wear a different tie with his shirt -- and not be afraid to mix patterns. ""That was the moment,"" Zyla said. ""I think I was instinctively choosing things that suited them more. I've always felt there was an appropriateness for each person."" It is no surprise that Zyla followed his passion to New York University to study costume design, then pursued a career in fashion. For a new season of warm-weather fashion trends, the Emmy-winning stylist is sharing his ""Style DNA"" philosophy that has aided his celebrity clients. In Zyla's eyes, not only is each person unique in their appearance, but they have ""true colors"" that are inherent, and indicative of their personality and style -- found in a person's eyes, hair and skin tones. The stylist also offers help in his book, ""The Color of Style,"" which came out in paperback last year. Zyla sat down with CNN for an interview last week to talk about spring and summer fashions, how to wear them in your own way and why everyone should embrace their true colors. The following is a transcript edited for length and clarity. CNN: What is your style philosophy? Zyla: If you think about it like this, you are the subject of a great painting and what you chose to fill in around you illuminates you, or it can make you recede. I feel there has been a lot of mystery around what looks good on people. My goal with all of this is I really believe that everyone has the right to look and feel fantastic. Everyone loves compliments, especially the compliment ""You look great,"" as opposed to ""Great fill-in-the-brand-name-skirt-here."" Color is not that much of a commodity -- it's attainable and the perfect way to express who we are. Your clothes and color should be used as raw materials to illustrate you -- you are the focal point. Your skin tone is your skin tone, you can either embrace it and illuminate it, or you can distract from it. Your skin, eyes and hair exist as givens, then you fill in the rest around it. It's very important to be who we are, we're all so unique, and I really want to triumph the individual. CNN: What are those key looks for spring and summer? Zyla: One of the things I would say is an important piece is the draped skirt. If you never have worn a pencil skirt, and you know it's not your best, don't do a draped pencil skirt. But if you always wear a-line and feel great in it, do a draped a-line skirt if you want to update. Take the trends and customize them for you. Also, white is a huge thing right now, which every couple of years it comes back, and this year is a more diaphanous approach where you're layering and so on. Individualize it by choosing your white. If you never wear stark white, and you look better in ivory, wear ivory. You don't have to follow the trends to the runway level, you should follow them to the customized version of you level. The way to find your white is you should match the white of your eyes. Another big trend are baroque patterns -- big chains and medallion prints. These very large prints can be overpowering. A great rule of thumb is if the print repeat is bigger than your head, it's too large. If you are someone who feels much better in solids, do it in an accessory -- a scarf or handbag that has that print on it. CNN: Were there any designers whose styles you were particularly excited to see in the spring or summer collection? Zyla: There are several. Tracy Reese makes me excited every year. The fact that she creates the scale of the collection that she does every year and it has just enough theatricality to it to make the pieces stand out, yet they don't look like costumes. She really is a talented designer with the perfect mix -- the balance is fantastic. I also love the dress designer Jay Godfrey. His dresses for spring are completely up-to-the-minute exciting, and a variety of silhouettes. Nanette Lepore is very good, I'm loving what I'm seeing there. I really think it is a very exciting spring season. The reason I'm excited about the designers I'm mentioning is they aren't just connected to one thing, they are doing nice variety. CNN: How do you embrace your style amidst the changing seasons? Zyla: Dressing in layers is always a good idea and prepare for what you're going to do that way as well. Atlanta, San Francisco, there area a lot of cities like this where each particular day can be drastically different. Throw a sweater in your bag, dress with a layer that can come off and think ahead of time. The best thing to do is think about the fabric of your clothing. As beautiful as linen is, it's not going to last until lunch -- it's going to be a wrinkled mess. Cotton is going to breathe. Natural fabrics that have a little weight to them are always going to be your friend because they will last through the day. CNN: Because the styles are more open this season, are there any key pieces that a lot of people can wear? Zyla: One of the trends is very bright, neon, what I call hyper-Popsicle colors -- very, very vivid, and I would say that if you want to have that, take one of the colors the looks great on you, and do it in an unexpected piece, like a skirt or coat. A lot of times, we think of these vivid colors in accents or smaller things, I think this is the season to embrace the vividness. I'm not saying just because tangerine tango is the color of spring that everyone should wear it. If the brightest color on your palette is an American beauty rose pink, why don't you use that in an unexpected way? Wearing a color that doesn't suit you, you're not going to be comfortable. CNN: What do you address in your book, ""The Color of Style""? Zyla: I address the idea that we all have an authentic style and true colors. In the first part of the book, I lead you to finding these true colors and what is your dramatic, romantic and energy color, and they all do very different things. Some make you feel very friendly and approachable, some make you feel sexy. In the second part, I lead you to one of 24 archetypes -- I believe there are 24 archetypes of women. With each archetype, I give you fragrance ideas, style ideas, fabrics, artists that represent your type, the must-haves, the must-avoids, the super power and the kryptonite. It's a read on the personality as well and really how to put a palette and a wardrobe together. In part three of the book, I teach you how to utilize all of these tools in shopping and cleaning out your closet. When you shop, do it with intention. And I also lead you to how to dress for every occasion. I really want people to honor their true colors and honor who they are in their authentic style. Then, I want them to really love themselves and flourish with this material."

Adm. Michael Mullen will meet with Pakistan's new prime minister and its military chief. Adm. Michael Mullen will meet with Pakistan's newly elected prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, and Pakistan's military chief, Gen. Parvez Kayani, Mullen's office said. Relations between the United States and Pakistan have been tense since the U.S. military sent ground forces into Pakistan's tribal regions earlier this month without Islamabad's permission. The incident prompted the Pakistani government to summon the U.S. ambassador to voice its disapproval, as well as deliver a ""demarche"" (a diplomatic petition or protest) through its ambassador in Washington. Last week, Kayani announced no foreign forces will be allowed to conduct operations inside Pakistan in light of the ""reckless"" U.S. military ground operation. Kayani said Pakistan's ""territorial integrity ... will be defended at all cost and no external force is allowed to conduct operations ... inside Pakistan."" His announcement came amid media reports that several months ago, President Bush authorized U.S. special forces to carry out ground assaults inside Pakistan without first seeking Islamabad's permission. Meanwhile, a suicide attack late Tuesday evening in the restive area of Swat killed three soldiers and wounded six others, the Pakistani military told CNN. Pakistan army spokesman Major Murad Khan said the driver of the suicide car bomb tried to ram the gate of a military checkpoint at a school in the Swat District. Troops shot from the check-post before the attacker reached his target, Khan said. The car exploded, and militants shot back as they ran away. The incident happened at a time when Muslims break their fasts in the month of Ramadhan. Swat militants loyal to banned religious leader Maulana Fazlullah have claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the military. The suicide attacker in the car was killed. A few others were also believed to have been killed or injured, but Khan said there were no confirmed numbers because it was dark and the militants removed the bodies of their dead and wounded. The explosion occurred at the Tutano Bandai school of Tehsil Kabal in Swat District in the North West Frontier Province. A military spokesman offer no additional details.

Gehad al-Khalek of Egypt says the hijab is a focus on inner beauty. (CNN) -- Last year at Christmastime, Rehan Seyam, a Muslim living in New Jersey, went to pick up some things at a local Wal-Mart. Seeing her distinctive traditional Muslim head covering called a ""hijab,"" a man in the store, addressing her directly, sang ""The 12 Days of Christmas"" using insulting lyrics about terrorism and Osama bin Laden. She was stunned. ""Do I look like a terrorist to you?"" Seyam said she asked the man. According to Seyam, the man replied, ""What else does a terrorist look like?"" Such stories are not altogether uncommon for Muslim Americans. According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, 53 percent of Muslims living in America said it has become more difficult to be a Muslim in the United States since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Fifty-one percent said they are ""very worried"" or ""somewhat worried"" that women wearing the hijab are treated poorly, according to the poll. A simple headscarf generally used by women to hide the hair from view, the hijab has become so controversial among some that several countries have banned or considered banning Muslim women from wearing them in public places. In light of this contentiousness, why do Muslim women choose to wear the hijab?  Watch the making of CNN's TV special ""God's Warriors"" » Gehad al-Khalek lives in Egypt and says the hijab is a focus on inner beauty. ""I want to shift the attention from my outer self to my inner self when I deal with someone, I don't want them to look at me in a way that wouldn't suit me,"" she told CNN in an upcoming documentary called ""God's Warriors."" Al-Khalek is fluent in English and German; studied in Europe; plays Western music on her guitar; and spent time working for a women's rights organization. She wears the hijab -- and says it's not just for religious reasons. ""My own conclusion was it is debatable whether it is a religious obligation or not, but I chose to keep it on because I do believe in modesty and you shouldn't be showing off yourself,"" al-Khalek said. The Quran calls for women to be modest in their dress but interpretation of the edict varies widely, according to religious experts who spoke with CNN. An author who has written widely on Islam told CNN the Quran does not require women to wear the hijab. ""There's nothing in the Quran about all women having to be veiled or secluded in a certain part of the house. That came in later [after Prophet Mohammed's time],"" said religious historian and author Karen Armstrong. For Seyam, the hijab is a religious duty. ""It's God's wish,"" she said. ""It's a requirement by God. He wants us to cover. He wants us to be modest,"" Seyam said. But as important as the hijab is to her, Seyam's decision to cover her hair wasn't one she made easily. ""It was very dramatic for me. And I remember, even now thinking about it, it really does make my heart beat a little bit faster,"" she said, ""I was making a decision I knew was permanent. You put on hijab, you don't take it off."" Through her childhood growing up in Long Island, New York, Seyam prayed with her devout Muslim parents, but says she was just ""going through the motions."" It wasn't until college that she decided to wear a hijab consistently. Influenced by her more devout friends, Seyam decided being a good Muslim meant covering her head. ""My sole purpose is to be here for the sake of Allah, and I'm doing something that he specifically says that you should be doing."" Seyam said there were practical factors in her decision as well. ""I'm sick of guys catcalling. It was just driving me crazy. I felt like a piece of meat."" But Seyam says she traded in catcalling for a different kind of negative attention. People ""look at me as if I am threatening and I do not feel like I am threatening looking. I don't feel I should instill fear in anybody's heart, but I do feel like I get dirty looks,"" she said. Still, Seyam says her faith sustains her and that wearing the hijab is an important part of that faith. ""I'm not here to live my life and do whatever I want. I'm here to worship God,"" Seyam said. ""I don't think that everybody has that, and I think that I'm lucky for it."" E-mail to a friend"

Cunningham told the officer he pushed Horn back and said: 'Then I cut him. I did what the Army taught me to do.'

When officers arrived at the scene at East First Street, Laurel, Cunningham was leaning against a car and Horn was lying on the grass next to Cunningham's feet. Horn had a cut on his right cheek and a deep cut on the left side of his neck, and a bloody knife three-and-a-half inches long was sitting on the picnic table. Horn appeared to be gasping for breath as an officer applied pressure to the neck wound, court records said. 'I cut him. He's dead,' Cunningham told police. 'The knife's on the table.' Horn was pronounced dead less than an hour later. After Cunningham was read his rights, he told officers he and Horn were sitting at the picnic table when they began arguing about whether the Army or Marines was the best branch of the military.

""I get mail from all over the world, 122 countries,"" she said. Henderson is using her fame as the iconic TV mother to help other moms who suffer from ""lackus appreciatus,"" which she says is ""a condition caused by years of under-appreciation and neglect"" of mothers by their kids. Her role as spokeswoman for the ""Center for Lackus Appreciatus Prevention"" is part of a tongue-in-cheek campaign sponsored by Kodak to promote an online service where Mother's Day cards can be sent for free. A video posted on YouTube points to the Mom-a-thon.com Web site, which aims to close the ""appreciation deficit"" between what your mom does for you and what you do for your mom. Although just five seasons of ""The Brady Bunch"" were produced, starting in the fall of 1969, children still grow up with the Bradys in syndication. ""It's never been off the air in the United States,"" she said. Henderson said she sometimes encounters mothers who tell her ""You know, I really didn't like you when my kids were small, because they preferred you to me."" She knows the power of her motherly voice, using it to make a reporter feel special with a scolding: ""Don't play ball in the house!"" For a moment, the interviewer feels like a Brady."

The actress, wearing a top that exposed part of her back, was surrounded by deputies and was quickly walked to a nearby side door labeled ""secure area."" ""We love you, Lindsay,"" her father, Michael Lohan, said as she disappeared. Lohan was ""cooperative"" as she was booked into the Century Regional Detention Facility about an hour later, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel had ordered Lohan to report to the courtroom to begin serving a sentence for a probation violation. Revel ordered that Lohan not be allowed to leave jail on a work-release or house-release program or with electronic monitoring during her sentence. The judge said, however, she has no control over how much of the 90-day sentence Lohan will end up serving. The sheriff, who runs the jail, has the power to release prisoners early because of jail overcrowding. Lohan should be released from jail after between 13 to 15 days ""unless something unusual happens,"" Whitmore said. He said it was routine for inmates who qualify for good behavior credits in jail to only serve 25 percent of their sentence. Lohan must enter a substance-abuse rehabilitation program within 24 hours of leaving jail, Revel said. ""I would like the transition to be sooner rather than later,"" she said. The judge placed tight restrictions on what the public would be able to see at Tuesday's hearing. While the world watched as Lohan, 24, broke down in tears at her sentencing July 6, the public was not able to see the actress handcuffed and taken into custody Tuesday. Cameras stopped rolling when the judge announced that Lohan was to be taken into custody. The judge also ordered that photos of Lohan must be restricted to those that showed her at the counsel table. The actress was ordered to serve 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation. She was also sentenced to spend 90 days in the drug and alcohol rehabilitation program after her jail term is completed. Lohan's next court date will come a week after her release from jail, although if she is in a rehab program her lawyer can appear without her, the judge said. Michael Lohan, whose estrangement from his daughter has been very public, sat two rows behind Lohan during the sentencing. His lawyer told reporters after the hearing that he was ""devastated"" that she was going to jail. The actress will be ""treated just as any other"" inmate in the jail, although she will have her own cell and remain apart from the general inmate population, the sheriff's spokesman said. Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence, and in the second incident she was charged with cocaine possession. The first arrest came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later, when she played identical twins in Disney's remake of ""The Parent Trap.""

Alexander R. Richter, 30, had just apologized for molesting a two-year-old girl and five other young children. He also acknowledged that his words could do nothing to undo the damage he'd caused. But the corner of his mouth turned upward slightly as Judge Timothy Boyle recounted Richter's comments to a pre-sentencing investigator. 'You said you feel sorry for [the children], that you ruined their whole lives. But you smiled as you said it,' Boyle noted. He paused for a moment and then noted with incredulity, 'You're smiling now!' Smirking: Alexander R. Richter, 30, prepares to leave the courtroom following his sentencing hearing at the Racine County Circuit Court on Thursday in Racine, Wisconsin Richter pleaded no contest in September to four charges related to child sexual assault. In exchange prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence of 80 years. A no contest plea is not an admission of guilt but is treated as such for the purposes of sentencing. Horrific crimes: Alexander Richter befriended classmates who were parents, offered to babysit their children then filmed himself sexually abusing them Boyle, who was not bound by the terms of the agreement, noted that Richter would be 110 by the time his sentence ended, adding that crimes as depraved as his deserved an even harsher penalty to ensure he died behind bars. The strongest evidence against Richter were his own videos, which he recorded while molesting at least six children ages two-and-a-half to six. Prosecutors say Richter's pedophilic crimes began when he was a teenager and that there might be other victims who haven't been identified. Richter even titled one of the DVDs the videos were found on 'Monster Unleashed.' It showed multiple scenes of Richter abusing three related girls and separate scenes with a young boy, the complaint said. One video showed a naked girl crying and fighting off Richter, the criminal complaint said. Boyle hesitated to even mention the DVD's title, noting that three anguished relatives of the victims were huddled together in the courtroom. The relatives declined to speak before or after the sentencing. One family provided a written statement to the judge, but he did not divulge its contents. Before he was sentenced Richter, clad in an orange prison jumpsuit, offered a quiet apology. 'I'd just like to say I'm sorry,' he said. 'It doesn't even feel like that should be good enough for the court.' Investigators say Richter, who was studying accounting at a technical college in hopes of joining his father's business, befriended vulnerable families and persuaded them to let him babysit their children. He then groomed the children for sex by buying them gifts and doing favors for them, the complaint said. Guilty: Alexander R. Richter, 30, listens as he is sentenced to 145 years in prison by Judge Timothy Boyle 'What kind of person does that other than someone who's deeply disturbed or, as I said, evil,' the judge said. 'Even though you didn't kill anybody, you killed something inside those children.' Boyle noted that Richter's youngest victim, a two-and-a-half-year-old girl, was still in diapers when he molested her. The comment drew sobs from one woman in the court. Neither Richter nor his public defender, Margaret Johnson, objected to the allegations listed by the judge or prosecutor Robert Repischak. Investigators said Richter was caught after a six-year-old boy told his mother that Richter had abused the boy and his four-year-old sister. When detectives served Richter with a search warrant, he told them, 'I'll save you time, the things you are looking for are under the coffee table,' according to the complaint. Officers found DVDs and camera equipment. Richter originally was charged with 49 felonies, including first-degree child sexual assault, sexual exploitation of a child and possession of child pornography. The charges carried a maximum penalty of 1,185 years in prison."

The company behind the former market-leading phone says yes. And it is betting a big stack of their dwindling chips that both new users and diehard ""CrackBerry"" devotees will agree. On Wednesday, Research in Motion (who would simply be named BlackBerry by the time the event ended) unveiled BlackBerry 10, a top-to-bottom overhaul of its mobile operating system. With BlackBerry 10, struggling phone maker eyes comeback With it came two new phones. One, the BlackBerry Q10, includes the physical keyboard that most users, or former users, consider virtually synonymous with the brand. But that one felt like little more than an afterthought. It was the Z10 -- a snazzy, touchscreen-only new phone -- that was used throughout the presentation to show off the system's new capabilities. And BlackBerry's website Wednesday was dominated with plugs for the Z10, while the Q10, like an embarrassing stepchild, was nowhere to be found. Forget the Z10 simply having fewer buttons than older BlackBerrys. With no ""home"" button, it's got fewer than the iPhone and most popular Android phones, as well. The Z10 isn't the first time BlackBerry has tried a keyboard-free device. But it's clear they're putting more stock in it than the ill-fated BlackBerry Storm, which hit an iPhone-dominated smartphone market with a resounding thud in 2008. From 'CrackBerry' to 'depressing': The BlackBerry's 5-year fall ""The absolute best typing experience in the industry, period."" That's how BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins touted his two new phones. Specifically, with white virtual keys and a black background, it's one that will be familiar to users of other smartphones, who BlackBerry hopes to woo back home, as well as the brand's current fans. ""Everything just feels like a BlackBerry typing experience,"" said Vivek Bhardwaj, head of software at BlackBerry. Kevin Michaluk, editor of BlackBerry fan site CrackBerry, says a touchscreen-only experience ""may seem odd to some considering the majority of today's 78 million communication-hungry BlackBerry subscribers are using models with a physical keyboard."" But after demoing the device, he says he's sold. ""Now that we have logged some mileage on the BlackBerry Z10, we're getting it,"" Michaluk wrote Tuesday. ""BlackBerry 10 has built a full touchscreen experience that even physical keyboard diehards will love."" 5 things that could make BlackBerry 10 a hit Function aside, experts say that in 2013 bringing a touchscreen device to the forefront was something BlackBerry had to do. ""The Q10 is really just a retro play to make sure they do not lose any of the 79 million users that still prefer the traditional BlackBerry keyboard,"" said Scott Snyder, co-founder of mobile-strategy firm Mobiquity and author of ""The New World of Wireless: How to Compete in the 4G Revolution."" ""The Z10 is really the future vision,"" he said. The Z10 may not signal the end of the physical keyboard on smartphones, he said. But it could be the beginning of the end as the last holdout evolves. ""RIM was caught off guard by this. Now they are in the mainstream, with a touch interface, for the majority of the 1 billion smartphones in the world. Only a small segment of enterprise users will continue to stay on the traditional keyboard model out of habit."" Review: BlackBerry's Z10 and BB10 feel a generation late"

Yesterday, however, towels would have come in handy for the odd dog-walker who braved the heavy downpours that soaked the beach under a grim, grey sky. Beaches were deserted at other resorts up and down the country as families stayed indoors, possibly wearing a jumper or two. Grim and grey: Rain meant Bournemouth beach was deserted apart from the odd dog-walker Heatwave: Last year families flocked to Bournemouth to bask in the Mediterranean heat Last Easter was the hottest for more than 60 years when the mercury approached 26C (80F), making some places hotter than Malaga and Athens. Those scenes were a distant memory yesterday, as were the T-shirts and shorts that many wore just last week during the fine weather. Chilly winds knocked temperatures down to a nippy 9C (48F) in Bournemouth and heavy rain soaked the last day of the long weekend for visiting holidaymakers.

Zeitoun, 54, was booked on three counts of solicitation of murder on Thursday for hiring an Orleans Parish inmate to kill his ex-wife, Kathy, her son from a previous marriage and another man who was often seen in her company, according to New Orleans police spokesperson Remi Braden. The inmate, Donald Pugh, told police that Zeitoun gave him Kathy Zeitoun's cell phone number instructed him to pose as a prospective tenant for one of her rental properties. He was then told to kill her and the two other men once inside the vacant home in exchange for $20,000 – as long as the couple’s four children were not present, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Unraveled marriage: Abdulrahman Zeitoun, right, is accused of trying to have his ex-wife, Kathy, left, murdered after their once-loving relationship has turned sour The Syrian-born New Orleans resident has gained notoriety after spending days rescuing stranded neighbors in his tin canoe and handing out water in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, ABC News reported. Zeitoun, who is Muslim, was wrongfully arrested by the police and National Guardsmen who mistook him for a terrorism suspect and spent 23 days in lockup without a hearing or the chance to let his wife know of his whereabouts. The dramatic saga was chronicled in the critically acclaimed 2009 nonfiction book Zeitoun by Dave Eggers. One of the focal points of Eggers’ book is the Zeitouns’ loving, happy marriage. But in the years since the volume was published, the relationship between the couple has come undone. Mr Zeitoun was placed on probation for a March 2011 attack on his wife. A police report cited by the Smoking Gun described Zeitoun as pushing Kathy to the floor and punching her in the head. The assault prompted Kathy Zeitoun to file for divorce, which was finalized last year. Zeitoun was arrested again last month after police said he hit Kathy’s windshield with a tire iron on a New Orleans street and struck her with it after she exited her car. The Times-Picayune reported that ‘Kathy Zeitoun said he later punched and choked her before a bystander intervened.’ Dave Eggers' 2009 book about the Zeitouns focused on the loving relationship  between the couple amid the unfolding natural disaster Zeitoun had been still in jail in connection to the July attack when he was charged with soliciting the murders. The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported that Kathy Zeitoun, her son and the husband of a friend, Ahmad Al-Akoum, were supposed to be killed while her ex-husband was behind bars to ensure that he would not be a suspect. However, instead of carrying out the murders, the would-be hit man revealed the plot to police. Pugh was able to pick Zeitoun out of a photo lineup and produced an envelope with Kathy Zeitoun's phone number written on it. Dave Eggers, author of the bestselling novel, and Jonathan Demme, a filmmaker who has expressed interest in adapting the book into an animated film, issued a joint statement and said they have been in daily contact with Kathy Zeitoun since the July 25 attack. Hero: Zeitoun gained fame during Hurricane Katrina after spending days rescuing his stranded neighbors in his tin canoe and handing out water ‘Our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of Kathy and the children. As the investigation proceeds, we hope that you will join us in respecting the Zeitoun family's privacy at this difficult time,’ they wrote. The New York Times reported that ‘in an interview with The New Orleans Times-Picayune, Ms Zeitoun said the book had accurately portrayed their relationship at the time. But she said her ex-husband had since grown angrier and more violent and his Islamic views had become more ‘radical.’’ After the book, the Zeitouns and Mr Eggers started a foundation to aid in the revitalization of New Orleans which has distributed more than $250,000 in grants, according to its website. Zeitoun is being held on $999,000 bond for the solicitation to murder charges and $150,000 for the domestic abuse charge."

Some 1,500 people, including tourists and staff, were escorted out of France's most famous landmark shortly after 7.30pm. It follows threats from Al-Qaeda pledging 'revenge' for the French intervention in the African state of Mali to fight Islamic terrorists. Tonight, police were standing guard near the Eiffel Tower in Paris after an anonymous phone call announced an attack on the monument Police said an anonymous call had been received from a phone booth in a Paris suburb warning that explosives had been place around the tower. The bomb warning said the blast would happen at 9.30pm, said police. But by 10pm there had been no explosion. The tower was still shut, with trained sniffer dog teams searching for a possible bomb. ‘It may be that the tower does not reopen tonight,’ said a police spokesman. ‘Searches are carrying on, but no members of the public are being allowed anywhere near. There has been a full evacuation.’ The tower is normally open until midnight during the Easter weekend, and nearby restaurants including Le Jules Verne are particularly busy on a Saturday night. A police cordon was formed around the tower and people were moved to the banks of the nearby River Seine. There have been numerous bomb alerts at the Eiffel Tower in recent years, and France is currently on the highest state vigilance alert because of threats from  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Sniffer dog teams searched the landmark for explosives after the Eiffel Tower was evacuated shortly after 7.30pm President Francois Hollande has placed himself at the centre of the global war against terrorism, committing troops and airpower to the on-going war in Mali. He has also stepped up security in mainland France, where there is a constant fear that Islamic extremists will strike. The 1,050ft tall iron lattice tower was built for the 1889 World’s Fair, and soon turned into a prestige symbol of modern France. It is the most visited paid-for monument in the world, with some 7million people a year going up it. For all these reasons, French security officials frequently highlight the tower’s vulnerability to terrorist attack."

The report was published in Berlin today after a week of line-by-line drafting and re-drafting. The final version, written by 235 international scientists and economists, says that efforts so far have failed to stop spiralling emissions of greenhouse gases – which have risen to ‘unprecedented levels’ in the past decade. Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chair of the authors, said: ‘There is a clear message from science: to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system, we need to move away from business as usual.’ The IPCC report is the first major assessment in seven years of the options for dealing with climate change. It will inform the policy decisions of Governments around the world, and vitally, will also be used as bargaining tool before next year’s UN climate conference in Paris, which aims to set legally binding targets on every nation to reduce carbon emissions. It is the final part in a trilogy of IPCC reports on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. The first part, published last September, found that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming. The second part, published a fortnight ago, warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘already occurring on all continents and across the oceans’. The final part, published today on the options for mitigating global warming, warns that we must drastically reduce our use of fossil fuels. The report warns: ‘Without additional efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond those in place today, emissions growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and economic activities.’ If no action is taken, global temperatures will rise by up to 4.7C by the end of the century, which scientists believe will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet. Global investment in fossil fuels will have to drop by £20billion a year until 2030, while world investment in low-carbon alternatives will have to rise by £90billion a year. Last year in Britain fossil fuels provided 65 per cent of electricity, with nuclear providing 20 per cent and renewable sources providing 15 per cent. The scientists are optimistic that if renewable energy is quickly rolled out, homes are built in a more sustainable and energy efficient way, and human consumption and wastefulness is changed, climate change can be controlled. Transforming the economy will require ‘substantial investment’ – up to 4 per cent of total global GDP between now and 2030. But the report authors argue that money would need to be spent on energy infrastructure anyway, and the additional spend will only slow growth by a tiny amount, no more than 0.14 of a percentage point. Renewable energy has already started to expand , the report finds, but a rapid acceleration is now needed. ‘Regarding electricity generation alone, renewable energy accounted for just over half of the new electricity‐generating capacity added globally in 2012, led by growth in wind, hydro and solar power,’ it says. But it warns that Governments will still need to pour subsidies in to get the systems off the ground. Green power: The report, by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), also highlights an urgent need for governments to switch to green energy, such as wind (pictured) and solar power ‘Many renewable energy technologies still need direct and/or indirect support, if their market shares are to be significantly increased,’ it says. Despite the focus on renewable energy, the scientists say natural gas still has a role to play for electricity production in a low-carbon world. The assessment is an unexpected endorsement of the British Government’s drive to frack for shale gas, and a blow to the green lobby which opposes it. The report says burning natural gas is a far cleaner method of energy production than burning coal. Gas will act as a ‘bridge technology’ while renewable energy is expanded, a phase that could last until 2050. Beyond that it would be phased out – but may still play a role if carbon dioxide emissions could be trapped and stored underground. The report says: ‘Greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current world average coal‐fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas combined‐cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated.’ Nuclear power could make an ‘increasing contribution to low-carbon energy supply’, the report finds, but the scientists warn that ‘operation risks’ such as disposing of radioactive waste mean there are a ‘variety of barriers and risks’. The scientists also suggest that an experimental technology could be used to ‘suck’ carbon dioxide out of the air, as a last-ditch ‘Plan B’ if emissions are not cut in time. The technology would work by using a little-tested system called BECCS –Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage. It would involve growing crops that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere then burn them in a power station to generate energy. The resulting emissions would then be captured at the plant and then stored underground. The net effect of that process would result in CO2 is removed from the air. Professor Edenhofer, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: ‘Many different pathways lead to a future within the boundaries set by the 2C goal [beyond which global warming becomes difficult to control. ‘All of these require substantial investments. Avoiding further delays in mitigation and making use of a broad variety of technologies can limit the associated costs.’"

It is clear reliability is the point we need to focus on the most. ‘At the moment I’m just disappointed with today, and I want to dig in with the team to try to understand what went wrong.

Today, engineers began the painstaking task of rebuilding the 180ft-long crossing, which some believe dates back to 1000 BC.

But a group of scientists who are fans of mushrooms and their other spore-producing  relatives believe we could be entering the ‘Age of the Fungus’ - and it could help save the world. Most of a mushroom’s power lies beneath the soil in a bundle of filaments called that mycelium that secrete enzymes capable of breaking down soil and rocks. They also produce potent chemicals to defend their territory, and release nutrients into the soil. Scroll down for video Gary Strobel, a microbiologist at Montana University, Bozeman, has developed a biofuel after discovering a wood-decaying fungus called Ascocoryne sarcoides (pictured) that has volatile compounds comparable to the type found in diesel fuels. He turned them into biofuel, which he has tested in his motorbike And it is this mycelium that is of predominant interest to mycologists, who believe mushrooms could be used to produce superior drugs and green materials of the future, New Scientist's Richard Webb reported. Gary Strobel, a microbiologist at Montana University, Bozeman, has developed a biofuel after discovering that a wood-decaying fungus called Ascocoryne sarcoides contains volatile compounds comparable to the type found in diesel fuels. Dr Strobel worked with the ‘jelly drop’ mushrooms to turn what he described as ‘dead leaf matter’ into biofuel, which he has since tested in his motorbike. Unlike biofuels made from fermented crops, the fungus-derived fuel could be made from agricultural waste and Dr Strobel is keen to commercialise the idea. And Eben Bower, CEO of Ecovative, believes he can take the idea a step further - with a car made from fungus. Mycelium is a flexible polymer, like plastic, which is biodegradable and can be persuaded to grow into different densities to produce a variety of materials with different properties. His company already supplies mushroom packaging to Dell computers called EcoCradle, which acts as a subsitute for polystyrene, which is not very environmentally friendly. Ecolative design makes packaging components from fungi to replace fabricated polyethylene foam parts that provide cushioning in large packages. A wine case is pictured but the company also makes packing material for Dell's computers It uses agricultural by-products like husks and plant stalks from rice, buckwheat and cottonseed combined with mycelium to grow the material. Bower is now working on making synthetic bone made using mycelium as a scaffold, as well as moulded parts for electric cars and fire-resistant insulating foam. The company is creating a sustainable surfboard made from mushrooms and is working with partners to create materials with 'unique performance properties' to meet specific needs. Paul Stamets, mycologist and adviser to the Programme of Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona’s College of Medicine, has 30 mushroom-based patents for environmental and medical devices, with his company Fungi Perfecti. His stand-put idea is ‘mycorestoration’ which involves adding groups of specific fungi to soil to clean up contamination and speed up the amount of carbon absorbed to help mitigate climate change. He also believes that Laricifomes officinalis can be used to make ‘universal insecticide’.

Deaf and mute, nine-year-old Lakhan was regularly tied to a pole by his elderly grandmother for fear he would run into traffic on a nearby road while she was away at work. Now, grandmother and grandson are living in a home for deaf and mute children, the patch of pavement where they both lived swapped for a roof above their heads. After reading about Lakhan on CNN in June, people wrote, tweeted, messaged, called and emailed from around the world. Many wrote to express their concern. Some wrote to ask how they could help. Others sent funds to help rehabilitate Lakhan. One person started a Facebook page to raise awareness about his plight. The response was overwhelming. ""I was under the impression -- 'who cares for such stories?'"" said Meena Mutha, a social worker with the Manav Foundation. She'd been trying to find Lakhan a more suitable home since placing him in a government-run shelter for juveniles in June. It was better than the street but not suitable for a boy with cerebral palsy who needed dedicated care. Mutha took on Lakhan's case in late May when a constable called her after seeing the boy's photo in a local newspaper. Lakhan was tied to a pole with rags and his elderly grandmother, Sakubai, was obviously struggling to take care of him as well as herself. ""He is deaf so he would not be able to hear traffic coming. If he ran onto the road, he'd get killed,"" Sakubai told CNN in June. ""See, it's a long rope,"" she said, holding out a piece of frayed cloth. There were many similar pieces of cloth tied to different poles. A life of struggle Sakubai told CNN Lakhan's father had passed away four years ago. His mother deserted them and his older sister ran away. She had done the best she could, selling trinkets on a nearby beach to earn a meager wage to feed them. There was no money for shelter so she stretched out a piece of cloth on the ground behind the bus stop where they both would sleep. Mutha struggled to find Lakhan a suitable home. Mumbai only has one government-run center for children with special needs and there was no room left for him. Her exasperation turned to hope when a father and son team, Alok and Parth Polke, stepped in with an offer to take in Lakhan for free. They also offered his grandmother a job in their hostel, in Satara, a scenic hill town not far from Mumbai. ""Lakhan's a special case,"" said Alok Polke, who runs Samata Shikshan Prasarak Mandal (SSPM), a non-governmental organization that caters to deaf and mute children. ""His father died, his mother and sister abandoned him. He's left alone. What happens after his grandmother?"" Hostel offers new hope CNN accompanied Lakhan, his grandmother and Mutha to Satara. He's the first mentally-challenged student to live in the SSPM hostel, which until now has only been for children who can't hear or speak. Polke said there were ""thousands of Lakhans in India"" who desperately need a roof over their heads. He said there are some homes for children who are deaf and dumb because they are comparatively easier to look after. However, children who are mentally-challenged need dedicated help: more staff, attention outside of school hours, funding, and infrastructure. ""That's lacking everywhere in India,"" Polke said. Lakhan appeared to settle in quickly into his new surroundings. Within an hour of reaching the hostel, he was running around in the yard, playing with the other children, each one a child of special needs, each one quickly engaged in a game of tag. They are some of the more fortunate ones. Lack of care in India According to the last census conducted in 2011, around 26.8 million people are in living with disabilities in India. That's 2.2% of the population of more than 1.2 billion. Other bodies, including the World Bank, say the figure is much higher. Many of them are children whose needs aren't being met by government shelters. Even the government admits the lack of facilities for disabled children in India is a serious problem. ""There should be lots more institutions for these kinds of children,"" said Vijaya Murthy, a member of the government-run Child Welfare Committee in the state of Maharashtra. When asked why the state had not established more institutions, she said the responsibility did not lie with the government alone. ""Society and government should come forward and have some rehabilitation plans for special needs children,"" she said.

Now a lengthy survey of the works indicates they're all part of a pattern -- a sweeping, interrelated series that illustrates how the continent's prehistoric inhabitants saw the universe and their place in it, University of Tennessee anthropologist Jan Simek said. ""What's part interesting is it spans an area literally from the Kentucky line down into northern Alabama,"" Simek said. Most of them are between 500 and 900 years old, but radiocarbon dating indicates one painting of a hunter in east-central Tennessee was laid down 6,000 years ago. That would make it the oldest representation in North America known to date, he said.

Simek and colleagues from the University of the South, the U.S. Geological Survey and Mississippi State University spent about a decade and a half documenting the rock art of the Cumberland Plateau, which slices across Tennessee between Chattanooga and Nashville. They found common themes, colors and depictions across the 94 sites, 50 of them underground. The aboveground works were drawn largely in red, a color associated with life, and tend to face to the south and west, away from the Appalachian Mountains. Why geologist tasted 2.6 billion year-old water ""That's looking into some of the most dramatic parts of the sky, especially in the spring and summer months,"" Simek said. ""And we know their relationship was such that they paid attention to celestial phenomena, but they also believed in a universe that was layered."" Some of the images suggest an ""upper world,"" where forces of the weather and mythic representations of the sun and stars influenced human life. Those tended to be at higher elevations. Nearer the surface, ""middle world"" imagery featured people, animals and plants. New insight into ancient Americans ""Very often some of the humans that are depicted outside of caves are doing otherworldly kinds of things,"" he said. ""Very often, their hands and feet are extended, and they have very elongated digits, as if they're reaching out of the rock or into the rock."" Many Native Americans believed boundaries between the spirit world and the natural were permeable, and things like rocks, trees and water sources -- including caves -- ""were places those boundaries could be crossed."" Down in the caves, however, the paintings were ""characterized by darkness and danger, and was associated with death, transformation and renewal,"" scientists wrote. ""The art sites, predominantly found in caves, feature otherworldly characters, supernatural serpents and dogs that accompanied dead humans on the path of souls,"" they wrote. The images are largely painted in black, a color associated with death. ""There's a small cave in the middle part of Tennessee, a very small cave that contains over 400 engraved images that are extraordinary,"" Simek told CNN. ""Some of them are tiny -- so small that if you didn't know how to look for them, you would never find them."" Some of the images feature birds a half centimeter (1/5 of an inch) long, Simek said -- yet when you look closely, ""You can see the wing feathers on them.""

Scotland Yard officers stopped the 217mph supercar on Park Lane yesterday after months of trouble with playboys racing through London's most exclusive streets. The driver of the rare yellow Lamborghini was stopped by police on motorcycles, who then took his details.  It is not clear whether the affluent motorist had been speeding or if another offence, like driving without the necessary insurance, had occurred. Residents of Knightsbridge, which has an average house price of £3.6million, have complained for years that drivers from the Gulf have been racing through their streets. The petrol-heads are often cheered on by camera-carrying youngsters, known as the Carparrazzi, but are hated by a number of furious residents who claim their lives are being ruined by the noise from their powerful engines.

No 10 slipped out a statement on Wednesday night revealing that the Prime Minister was recommending four male former ministers for knighthoods. It also emerged that the two women axed from the Cabinet are likely to get peerages. The knighthoods will go to three Tories – James Paice, Edward Garnier and Gerald Howarth – and one Liberal Democrat, Nick Harvey, even though they have served for only two years. Both the decision and timing of the announcement have been criticised. Sir Alistair Graham, former head of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘Why have these been announced separate from the normal twice yearly lists? ‘It is fatal to the dignity and credibility of any honours system if they are seen to be automatic.’ Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘The distribution of consolation prizes to sacked ministers is likely to bring the honours system into further disrepute and ridicule.’ Graham Smith, of Republic, which campaigns for reform of the process, said it appeared to be ‘rewards for failure’, adding: ‘It is a straightforward abuse of the system.’ Rewarded:  (Clockwise from top left) Edward Garnier, Jim Paice, Gerald Howarth and Nick Harvey have all been put forward by the PM for knighthoods Lib Dem MP Greg Mulholland said it was ‘quite disgraceful’ for dumped ministers to be offered ‘a sweetener of an honour’. There was anger among female MPs that sacked male ministers had been given gongs while there was nothing for Cheryl Gillan and Caroline Spelman. Sources said they were furious at their ‘cold and calculating’ treatment. But No 10 insiders indicated both were likely to get peerages after the next election. Last week, the Commons Public Administration select committee called for political involvement in the honours system to end. Mr Cameron steeled his nerves with a glass of wine before sacking ministers, sources said. But they denied he reduced ministers to tears or sacked Mrs Spelman because she was too old at 54. The Premier also rejected claims he made anyone cry, telling ITV’s Daybreak: ‘That is not true.’"

""It takes some heartfelt conversations to begin balancing the career scales in a marriage,"" says an expert. ""My career was just beginning to bloom,"" says the Stuart, Florida, resident, ""but we both placed more emphasis on Gary's career."" Misti, 47, was raised to believe that the man's career comes first. So she went, taking a token title as co-manager of the resort. But less than a year after their arrival in 2005, a fire ravaged the resort and Gary's contract was terminated. ""The strain on our relationship was sizable,"" she says. The couple returned to Florida, where Misti went back to work as a publicist and Gary as the general manager of a yacht club and marina. Her income this year, she says, will exceed Gary's. It's common for couples to place more emphasis on the man's career, according to a 2007 study of more than 9,000 married men and women ages 25-59. The researchers, from the University of Iowa and the University of California-Davis, also found that when couples relocate, the husband tends to get a salary boost -- $3,000 on average. But the wife loses $750. ""When couples migrate, they are [typically] doing it for the benefit of the husband's career, and so the wife is what we call the 'trailing spouse,'"" says study author Mary Noonan, associate professor of sociology at the University of Iowa. ""She may have to take a job in the new location that is a less-than-ideal match for her skills [or] qualifications."" Expert: 'Things are moving slowly in the right direction' Why do couples, even today, let the woman's job take a back seat? Blame it on socialization, says Noonan. While it may not be true for every relationship, more often than not, she says, ""men and women are taught to play very different roles within marriage. Women are socialized to play a homemaking role within the family, whereas men are encouraged to focus on their careers and breadwinning.""  See how one dad has taken on child-rearing duties » Daniel Buccino, a psychotherapist and faculty member at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, agrees. ""Until more men are willing to say, 'You know, honey, you shouldn't have to change your name or sacrifice your career, and I'll stay home with our kids and aging parents,' progress will remain glacial,"" he says. ""But things are moving slowly in the right direction."" After Dayna Steele, 48, published her first book in March and began making the media rounds, she found herself dealing with subtle power plays at home. ""I have tried very hard to schedule around my husband's full-time job and keep him posted on my schedule, confirming dates before I book them,"" says Steele, a former radio host living in Seabrook, Texas. ""Then, he started scheduling things over mine without telling me. ""It turned into a battle when I first tried to point out to him what he was doing -- trivializing my new career after promising to support it because he had a 'more important' job."" Steele knows her husband's salary and benefits are important but says her career deserves respect, too. ""We're not quite all the way there, but we're making some progress,"" she says. Steele's husband, Charles Justiz, 55, a NASA research pilot, says he does his best to show he values his wife's career, but it can be challenging, especially with two children. ""We've had some collisions,"" he admits. ""I can't call NASA and say, 'Excuse me, I can't come in because my wife has a book signing.'""  See how CNN journalists juggle careers with motherhood » But they're both working on being more flexible, he says. ""I love my wife, and the old saying is true: 'If Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.'"" 'Balancing career scales' Experts have some tips for couples clashing over a career move: Trade places. ""It takes some heartfelt conversations to begin balancing the career scales in a marriage,"" says Les Parrott, a clinical psychologist and faculty member at Seattle Pacific University. ""It requires both spouses to be honest with their feelings."" Parrott asks clients to list what's important to them about their careers, assigning each element a value from 1 to 10. After each spouse makes a list, they try to guess how much their partner values each item. ""It's almost always an eye-opener,"" says Parrott. ""It helps them empathize. It helps them trade places. And with that new perspective, they are ready for a more honest and grace-filled exploration of their options together."" Try the ""package deal"" approach. When a couple is considering relocating, Buccino says, one spouse should see what the new company can do for the other. Switch off. Buccino says the fluidity of today's job market gives couples ""opportunities to evaluate and re-evaluate and hopefully switch off between whose career takes priority at various phases along the marital life cycle."" When neither is willing to budge, there's always the long-distance marriage. ""I have seen two-career couples that live in two different cities,"" Buccino says, ""because neither is willing to pass up great career opportunities."" While such an arrangement may be a good interim move, it can take a toll on the relationship. ""Some couples have not made it,"" Buccino says. ""If they're committed to each other and the relationship, and otherwise so busy with work when apart, then it can work. But I'm not sure I'd recommend it as a first choice.""

Chelsea, Manchester City and West Ham who were all in the top 5 before play started were all victims whilst close rivals Southampton and Arsenal were beneficiaries. Penalties, dives and offsides were called incorrectly as we reached the halfway point of a wholly unsatisfactory season from too many select group officials. Chelsea players, in particular Cesc Fabregas, were rightly upset with Anthony Taylor's decision on Sunday Alex Song and Andy Carroll complain to referee Neil Swarbrick after Song's strike was disallowed Joe Hart let's George Boyd's flick slip through his hands, but the Burnley man should have been flagged offside Craig Pawson inexplicably missed Papiss Cisse's elbow on Seamus Coleman during Newcastle vs Everton Cisse went on to score Newcastle's first goal, which made it 1-1, but is likely to face a ban for the violence Whilst the Papiss Cisse incident does not affect the top 6 it was the worst offence of the day for which he will be banned retrospectively by the Football Association for his outrageous elbow. The more times you see what can only be described as an assault by the Senegalese striker the worse it gets but had Pawson seen it, and I wonder how he didn’t, he would have dismissed him and a standard ban applied which is what the FA must apply. The most controversial was the caution for Cesc Fabregas who will have that yellow card against his name which could result in a ban and the football association must be pressed to review this process. Cesc Fabregas is clearly caught by Matt Targett, causing him to go down in the Southampton penalty area Fabregas cannot believe the decision to deny him a penalty and book him for diving - the FA should overturn it I have called for referees to be given more training and advice regarding simulation which needs to come from within the game as players and managers understand this offence far better than officials. West Ham’s ‘goal’ from Alex Song provides the best debate for the day. It was a superb strike from Song which Wojciech Szczesny cannot see due to a cluster of players from both teams. There were three West Ham players in offside positions as Song kicked the ball but all three were running out, ‘disassociating themselves from play’ and so not deemed to be interfering with play. Song's strike should have been given as the West Ham players were 'disassociating themselves from play’ Diafra Sakho, who ran over the ball, was clearly not in Wojciech Szczesny's line of sight when Song shot The ball travels towards the corner of the goal where Diafra Sakho jumps over it and as he is not in the line of sight of the goalkeeper he is not interfering with the ‘keeper. Replays from behind the goal show that Andy Carroll could be in Szczesny’s line of sight hence the assistant’s raised flag but it’s a goal that I would have wanted to stand. So, not a great day for officials although to be fair Phil Dowd was correct with bot dismissals at Hull as was Martin Atkinson in sending off Fabian Delph for an over the top tackle at Villa Park so it wasn’t all bad. Martin Atkinson was right to send off Aston Villa's Fabia Delph for a tackle than went over the ball Phil Dowd was spot on with both his red cards, dismissing Paul Konchesky and Stephen Quinn Remember that on Boxing Day QPR were denied a clear penalty (Gibbs on Zamora), Sunderland should have had two penalties for handball against Hull (Bruce and Quinn), Ivanovic should have been cautioned for diving, Newcastle should have had an early penalty when Mata tripped Gouffran and Stoke’s Jon Walters should have been dismissed for pulling Everton’s Leighton Baines when clean through on goal."

The 28-year-old must now beat Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer, who saw off compatriot Tommy Robredo in a 6-2 6-1 6-1 win, in the semifinal if he is to replicate Yannick Noah's 1983 triumph. Only one Frenchman has reached the men's singles finals at Roland Garros since, with Henri Laconte beaten by Mats Wilander of Sweden in 1988. Sixth seed Tsonga was in irresistible form on Tuesday as he atoned for the intense disappointment of his quarterfinal exit against Novak Djokovic last year, when he lost despite creating four match points. ""It's extraordinary to be here and to have won,"" he said. ""I could not have dreamed it any better. I played superbly and I beat a champion who has won everything."" When Federer took an early break in the first set, it seemed as though the Swiss would be coasting to yet another grand slam semifinal but the 28-year-old Frenchman rallied in superb form. The first Frenchman into the last four since Gael Monfils five years ago, Tsonga has reached his first semifinal at Roland Garros without dropping a set. Meanwhile, 31-year-old Federer -- who was bidding for an 18th grand slam title -- struggled to find any rhythm on a surface where he has never convinced. The defeat means the former world number one has failed to reach the semifinals of a grand slam for only the fifth time since 2004. Only one of his 17 grand slams has come in Paris, with the Swiss having won the Australian Open four times, the U.S. Open on five occasions and Wimbledon in seven different years. In a performance littered with 34 unforced errors, the demise of 2009 champions Federer came in just one hour and 51 minutes to the delight of those watching courtside at the Chatrier stadium. ""I thought he played great today,"" Federer said. ""He was, in all areas, better than me today. That's why the result was pretty clean. ""I was impressed by the way he played today. I think I struggled a little bit everywhere. To be honest, personally, I'm pretty sad about the match and the way I played."" Tsonga -- who lost his only grand slam final to Novak Djokovic at the 2008 Australian Open -- has triumphed in only one of his three meetings against Ferrer, when defeating the Spaniard at Wimbledon in 2011. Ferrer made light work of beating Robredo as he reached the semifinals at Roland Garros for the second year in succession, the key difference being that -- like Tsonga -- he has not dropped a set this time around. On Wednesday, the lineup for the second semifinal will be known when world No. 1 Novak Djokovic takes on Tommy Haas while Rafael Nadal will try to continue his domination of Paris when facing Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka."

Mexican families swim and wash cars along the banks of the Rio Grande at the U.S. border in Juarez in June. The Border Patrol captured 695,841 people nationwide in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007, down from 907,445 for the same period the previous fiscal year, or a 23 percent drop, said Border Patrol spokesman Michael Friel. Arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border declined by 24 percent, he said. Border Patrol officials said the reasons for the change are varied and complex, but Friel said, ""We're clearly seeing a deterrent."" One factor cited by officials is the end of the practice of releasing non-Mexican immigrants, pending court hearings. The Border Patrol captured  50,349 non-Mexican illegal immigrants nationwide in the nine-month period ending June 30, down from 89,952 during the same period of fiscal 2006. That's a 44 percent decrease. The decrease was 48 percent for non-Mexican illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border. Other factors include the 6,000 National Guard troops patrolling along the Southwest border, more detention space and enhanced enforcement in the interior, Friel said. Outside economic, political and social factors also are ""always involved"" in fluctuating levels of immigrants seeking entry into the United States, he said. Last month, opponents effectively killed President Bush's long-fought and emotion-laden immigration bill in the Senate when members voted against advancing the legislation. The bill aimed to create a path to citizenship for some of the 12 million illegal immigrants and to toughen border security.

Entrepreneur Mark Fuller in the Sanctum Soho hotel, a rock'n'roll ""haven of hedonism"" in London. ""F*** the recession, let's get on with it,"" he says, while sitting on the roof terrace of the Sanctum Soho, a 30-room establishment dubbed the rock'n'roll hotel, as much for its ""anything goes"" service philosophy as the pedigree of its owners, which include the co-managers of heavy metal band Iron Maiden. ""We do not recognize there is a credit crunch because we believe you should battle through it,"" Fuller says, adding, ""If you get panicky and scary about things like this, you're no man at all."" Besides, he admits, three years ago when he started working on the concept of an 'alluring haven of hedonism' (as the hotel is described on its Web site), the credit crunch didn't exist. And by the time it hit, it was too late to pull out. ""We wouldn't do anyway,"" Fuller insists, adding ""fortune favors the brave, as they say.""  See images of the rock star hotel » The former band manager turned entrepreneur, is looking quite the rock star tonight, decked head-to-toe in black while a shiny silver skull stares ominously from his belt buckle. Downstairs, staff are frantically preparing for a launch party that promises to be heavy on champagne, cocktails and celebrities. It's almost like the crunch doesn't exist. This is Fuller's world and he's hoping plenty of people will want to join it. ""In every downturn in the economic climate I think people look for some affordable glamour and escape,"" he says. Fuller also owns and runs the Embassy Hotel, an exclusive nightclub in the upmarket London suburb of Mayfair which he plans to franchise in Dubai, Istanbul and Abu Dhabi. The partners in his new hotel venture ooze rock credential: Iron Maiden co-managers Rod Smallwood and Andy Taylor. While Taylor has experience running a restaurant and hotel, ""The Inn on the Green,"" Smallwood's experience in the hotel industry is based on 30 years on the road with Iron Maiden. Last year he stayed in 80 hotels in 40 countries and one of his biggest gripes is returning to his hotel after a gig and finding the bar is closed. ""You want good service, and you want the bars open, and you want good food available,"" he says from the roof terrace equipped with a bar and Jacuzzi he's taken to calling ""my lounge."" Smallwood expects to stay in the hotel once a week and says it will become a London bolt-hole for the band. While non-music types and the tone-deaf are welcome to stay in the hotel, over-enthusiastic groupies are not. ""If you're on the road for three months, you can never escape,"" Smallwood says. ""The fans, some of them, think they have a God-given right, just because they're staying in the same hotel, to put a camera in your face over your cornflakes."" ""The rule here is no autographs and no photographs,"" he says firmly. ""Say Paul Weller is sitting in the corner having a beer, and you go and ask for an autograph or photograph, you will not stay here again."" Along with privacy and a beer at all hours, guests have access to an on-call guitar doctor, a necessity, apparently, if you break a string while strumming in your room. Guests who have inadvertently left their guitar at home can hire one from reception. The rock star concept extends to the room decor. The silver wallpaper and mirrored columns may appear garish in daylight, but at 3 a.m. one suspects they add a touch of glamour. Free standing baths are a bold leap from the bed and the mini bar is well-stocked with champagne. Rod Smallwood is confident the concept will work. ""Recession or no recession, we're talking about 30 rooms in a huge major city. If we can't sell 30 rooms in the depths of recession it means we're useless, and we know we're not."" Mark Fuller says he's selling more than a hotel room. In times of economic crisis the Sanctum Soho offers the chance to forget the mortgage and live like a rock star, if only for a day. ""You can sit in the restaurant and have a hamburger for seven pounds ($10),"" he says. ""The drinks are cheaper than most hotels, and probably cheaper than most nightclubs. The room accommodation runs everywhere from £125 ($255) straight up to £450 ($650). Take your pick. Cut your coat."" I mishear him. ""Cut your coke?"" I ask. ""No, you can't do that!"" he exclaims. ""Musicians are not like that anymore,"" Fuller says. ""The music industry is such now that people release CDs to support tours, not the other way around, so this is a professional state. ""I just don't want to be the hotel at the end of the tour, then I'm in danger,"" he laughs."

Attorney Walter Madison, who represents accused 16-year-old Ma'lik Richmond -- one of two defendants in the case -- filed three motions in Juvenile Court. In addition to relocating the trial, two other motions ask the court to postpone the February 13 trial, and to close the trial to the public. A hearing is set for January 25, when defense lawyers and prosecutors are expected to argue the motions before Judge Tom Lipps, Madison added. Madison said no other motions were filed Friday. The lawyer for co-defendant Trent Mays, 16, could not be reached for comment. ""We are reviewing the motions and we will respond in kind,"" Dan Tierney, spokesman for Ohio's Attorney General Mike DeWine told CNN. Defense battles social media blizzard in Ohio rape case On Sunday, Mays' lawyer, Adam Nemann, also said he planned to file at least two motions including a change of venue ""given its publicity and what we perceive as threats to individuals, perhaps witnesses, and also defendants and even defense counsel."" Media attention and an explosion of online postings about the case are part of the reason, according to Nemann. ""We're concerned about safety issues at this point,"" he added. On Sunday, Tierney would not discuss whether there are any alleged threats. Opinion: Teach young men to treat women with respect ""The investigation is ongoing and it includes all aspects of the case including evidence put out in social media, Tierney told CNN. Mays and Richmond are each charged with raping a 16-year-old girl during late-night partying and drinking last August, according to prosecutors. CNN is not identifying the girl, who is a juvenile, in accordance with its policy not to release the names of alleged rape victims. ""She was unresponsive, not in a position of consent, and they knew about it, and let's be clear, they knew she was drunk,"" special prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter told a judge at probable cause hearing last October. A judge from Cincinnati is hearing the case after a local judge recused himself to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest. Police Chief William McCafferty says many people in the small eastern Ohio town know someone who may have a connection to the case. Online outrage prompts city website Often trials are granted a change of venue because of fear of a tainted jury pool. This trial is a bench trial, meaning the judge will determine the teens' fate. But defense attorney Nemann said he has another reason to ask for the change. He plans to tell the judge his case may be hamstrung by hesitant witnesses. ""I'm concerned about whether or not the case should be tried in this area. Perhaps the fact that it is in the Steubenville area is going to prohibit certain people from wanting to come forward and testify,"" Nemann said. Some potential witnesses who attended the parties where the alleged sexual assaults occurred are refusing to talk with his defense team, the lawyer said. He would not say how many witnesses. The motions will be filed under seal, Nemann said. Lawyers for both defendants have said their clients are not guilty of the charges. ""We deny the accusations completely. We deny the lack of consent. We deny that there was sexual activity. We deny that there was a rape. And we steadfastly maintain that,"" Nemann told CNN."

The game was in overtime. The mood, electric. Number 35 came charging up to the net and hit a last-moment winning layup for his undefeated Fennville High School Blackhawks to end the regular season Thursday night with a perfect 20 wins. The other players hoisted their star, 16-year-old Wes Leonard, on their shoulders. The screaming crowd charged the court to hug him. It was the biggest moment in memory for the tiny Michigan town of Fennville. And then it all turned to black. Silence fell under the harsh glare of the florescent lights. Leonard lay still on the court, pale in his school colors. His family and coaches surrounded him. He wasn't breathing, his friend Arista Sauceda recalled. His heart had stopped cold. After attempts to revive the varsity player in the gym, an ambulance transported him to nearby Holland Hospital. Doctors worked on him for an hour and 20 minutes. They could not save him. By 10:40 at night, when Leonard should have been out celebrating with his classmates, he was dead. An autopsy Friday determined that Leonard died of cardiac arrest due to an enlarged heart, said a statement from Dr. David A. Start, the Ottawa County chief medical examiner. As news of Leonard's death spread, a small community on the banks of Lake Michigan convulsed in shock. A moment of enormous school pride was reduced to irrelevance, a moment of joy turned into the opposite. A Facebook memorial page -- R.I.P. Wes Leonard -- created Friday, quickly filled with thoughts and prayers. ""Blackhawk Down,"" the page said. Sauceda described Leonard as an affable guy, popular for his smile and jokes. He excelled in athletics, scoring 1,000 career basketball points and playing quarterback for the school's football team. She said Leonard's family moved to Fennville when he was in middle school. His mother, Jocelyn Leonard, teaches music and is the drama director at Fennville, and Sauceda said the family had helped bring the school community together. Jocelyn Leonard had canceled Thursday night's performance of ""How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying"" because she wanted to watch her son play in the game, reported CNN affiliate WOOD. It was a make-up game to compensate for blizzard-canceled events last month. Everyone had so looked forward to Thursday's game -- not only was it the last of an undefeated regular season, but it pitted Fennville against Bridgman, a school that beat them by just one point last year. It was revenge, as Sauceda put it. Fennville was down 14 points but came back to tie the game at 53. Leonard scored his team's last four points for the 57-55 victory. Sauceda had screamed her lungs out during the game. She was running toward Leonard to hug him when he went down. Tim Breed, a spokesman for Holland Hospital and a 1977 Fennville graduate, was also in the gym. He doesn't normally attend games, but thought he could not miss his alma mater's perfect season closer. When Leonard collapsed, the crowds were asked to leave the gym. Breed was on his way home when he was paged by a local newspaper reporter. He rushed to the hospital to find medical teams trying to resuscitate Leonard. Shortly after that, a text message appeared on Sauceda's phone from a friend at the hospital. Sauceda was about to go to sleep. Instead, she was jolted awake, the shock so severe she wasn't even able to immediately cry. In the morning, she stayed home from school. And wrote on Facebook: ""Wes, you were taken from our lives too soon ... you were the most amazing friend, I will never forget you, and how you have changed us all, I am so thankful to have been apart of your life. Please watch over us, and cheer us on as our boys win state! RIP # 35 WES LEONARD."""

Janine Sligar, 47, of Wray, Colorado, was sentenced Thursday for sexual abuse of a ward. After serving her sentence, she will serve five years of supervised release and must register as a sex offender, spokesman Jeff Dorschner said in a news release. Sligar, who must surrender to a facility designated by the Bureau of Prisons on March 2, did not respond to a telephone call to her home for comment. She was indicted in July by a federal grand jury in Denver and pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in October. According to the plea agreement, Sligar, a 14-year Bureau of Prisons veteran, said she and inmate Eric McClain met in February 2007, when he was assigned to clean her office. ""They began to have conversations and realized they had similar interests,"" the plea agreement said. That summer, they initiated a sexual relationship that included 10 to 20 sessions of oral sex and sexual intercourse, ending in October 2007, it said. The liaisons primarily occurred in a staff restroom in the housing unit at the Federal Prison Camp in Florence, Colorado, according to the agreement. Sligar, who acknowledged having detailed her activities in a journal, said she obtained a cell phone with a non-local phone number so McClain could call her without raising suspicion and admitted she gave him contraband that included photographs with explicit sexual poses, the plea agreement added. ""Defendant also admitted using her cell phone camera to take graphic pictures of a sexual nature which depict defendant and this inmate,"" it said. Authorities began investigating the incident after receiving a tip about the inappropriate relationship. They then learned that Sligar had changed the primary beneficiary on an insurance policy from her children to McClain. A subsequent search of her home turned up the journal and photographs."

Her trophy cabinet is bulging with more than 100 medals and prizes. But it isn't just Rebekah who holds the talent. Girl power: The Tiler sisters - (L-R): Lisa, 7, Rebekah, 13, and Sophie, 9, show off their skills at their gym in Mytholmroyd Also on the podium are Sophie, nine, and seven-year-old Lisa, who are following in their sister's footsteps and bagging their own trophies. And even their youngest sister, four-year-old Emily, is keen not to miss out and often tries her hand at the famous 'clean and jerk' move, practising with a broom handle. Rebekah's strength became apparent when she was a baby and could lift herself up off the floor, amazing her parents Chris and Emma. The summer Olympics inspired Rebekah who, having been invited to train for Team England, and as a new member of Team GB, is well on the way to Olympic glory. Head of the clan: 13-year-old Rebekah's trophy cabinet is bulging with more than 100 medals and prizes but her sisters aren't far behind her Rebekah, from Denholme, West Yorkshire, said: 'I go to Team GB camp weekends where we are tested. 'I'll be training with them for the next four years.' But her success doesn't come without hard work. The teenager faces a daily demanding schedule and has to stick to a strict diet. She said: 'I train three times a week for two hours at a time. And I have to keep to a strict diet, with lots of protein, eggs and spinach. 'This is very important, especially when competitions approach as you have to make sure you are within your weight category.' Following in her footsteps: Sophie, nine, and Lisa, seven, who are following in their sister's footsteps are bagging their own trophies As well as the Olympics, Rebekah is also focusing on the Commonwealth Games in Scotland in 2014 and hopes to take part in next year's European youth championships. Speaking about the sporting opportunities, she said: 'I'm really excited. My school friends think it's great and there's a noticeboard at school showing all my achievements.' Rebekah attends special camps where her speed work and reaction times are tested. 'I just find weights really easy to lift. I like clean and jerk best,' she added. Last year, Rebekah won numerous new records, including setting a new title for the snatch and clean and jerk in the 58kg class in the British under-13 contest. Focus: As well as the Olympics, Rebekah is also focusing on the Commonwealth Games in Scotland in 2014 In September alone, the teen, who has been praised for her technique, broke an astonishing nine British records at the National Weightlifting Bergson Trophy in Myetholmroyd, including two at under-15 level set by Britain's best known female weightlifter Zoe Smith. Rebekah has now moved up to the 69kg body-weight class, and smashed 47 British and regional records, in under 14, 16, 18, 20 and senior categories. She often outclasses contestants far older than herself. In the British under-20 and under-23s category, she set new Northern Weightlifting records in her class. But Rebekah's sisters are firmly following in her footsteps and each one recently won their weight category, taking home three gold trophies.

Rebekah added: 'I was about five when I started lifting weights. My dad used to bodybuild and I would copy him.' Chris, who is still involved in bodybuilding, advises his daughter, and Emma provides refreshments at competitions. Emma said: 'We are usually away every weekend. Bodybuilding has taken over our lives but we love it and really enjoy it. Family support: Mother Emma says she and her husband are 'really proud' of their daughters 'We are really proud of Rebekah and her sisters. We get nervous but sometimes I'm shaking as I watch.

Writing on the BBC’s message-board, one commented: ‘Does anyone agree with me that there is too much talk and not enough skiing shown in Ski Sunday.’ Another said: ‘Since it has changed to the new format there is too much chat.‘ One added: ‘I wouldn’t say the programme wasn’t long enough... just that there isn’t enough skiing in it.’ Others specifically criticised the focus on other sports and one said the show was being ‘constantly messed around’ with and ‘spoilt by management’.

From 2019, the cross-London fast-train service will also include the busy Berkshire commuter  town – giving a fast track for workers in the City,  the Government announced. As well as benefiting commuters, the improved travel links are also likely to push up house prices in the Reading and Twyford area. The £14bn Crossrail scheme will extend as far as Reading to the west of London, it has been announced today. Pictured is the new extended route There had been intense speculation that the line could be extended further west from Maidenhead  - given a major refurbishment of reading station - although until today there had been no firm decision on this. Crossrail stretches from Berkshire in the west to as far east as Shenfield in Essex and also takes in spurs to Heathrow Airport in west London and to Abbey Wood in south east London. Transport Minister Stephen Hammond said that, once Crossrail services began across the whole line in 2019, passengers travelling to London from Reading and other Thames Valley stations would be able to reach more destinations across London without the need to change at Paddington. Once operational, Crossrail services are expected to serve Maidenhead on a four-trains-per-hour basis as originally planned, with two of these services continuing to Reading via Twyford. In addition, the planned future Great Western franchise service pattern from Reading to London will not change. Twice hourly, semi-fast services and existing fast mainline services will continue, calling at the same stations as today. Mr Hammond said the Reading extension will also generate some cost savings from reduced infrastructure enhancements at Maidenhead and Slough, and only minor works will be required at Twyford and Reading to accommodate Crossrail services. A computer generated image of a Crossrail train. It is thought the move will boost property prices in the Ready and Twyford area Reading town centre - which is now to be included in the Crossrail project. The route will now run from Reading through to Shenfield, Essex Rail minister Mr Hammond said the extension of Crossrail to Reading was ‘further proof of our commitment to deliver a transport network fit for the 21st century.’ He said: ‘It will improve connectivity and deliver greater choice and convenience for passengers travelling into London. It will also make better use of the already congested Great Western Main Line.’ He said this would free up capacity for potential direct services from Reading to Heathrow as part of the western access scheme. The minister said he had also asked Network Rail to look at the cost benefit analysis of ‘increasing the number of faster trains between Reading and Paddington.’ Mike Brown , managing director of London Underground and London Rail, said:  ‘Extending Crossrail to Reading will provide passengers with more journey options and will create better connections and direct services between Reading, Twyford and destinations across London without the need to interchange at Paddington.’ Trains will be introduced to run Crossrail services as follows: Ministers said Crossrail will boost London’s rail capacity by 10per cent by connecting Reading and Heathrow in the west with Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. Up to 24 trains an hour will run between Paddington and Whitechapel during peak times. A Transport department spokesman said: ’It is estimated that Crossrail will generate at least 75,000 business opportunities and support the equivalent of 55,000 full-time jobs around the UK. Three out of 5 businesses currently winning work on the project are based outside London.’ London mayor  Boris Johnson said: ‘I am thrilled that the people of Reading and Twyford will be able to take advantage of Crossrail, putting them on the doorstep of London's main employment centres by directly linking them to the City and West End in world-class style.’ Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh MP said: ‘Labour in government safeguarded the potential Crossrail route from Maidenhead to Reading, so we welcome the decision to extend Crossrail to Reading. ‘This is good news for commuters struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and will make the most of Labour's investment in Reading station, which should help the Thames Valley economy to grow faster.’ Reading East Conservative MP Rob Wilson, although welcoming the extension, said: ‘This can only be seen as stage one in the process of delivering Crossrail for Reading. This first phase will not reap the full benefits that Crossrail can and should bring to benefit people and businesses in Reading and the wider region. ‘Because there will be so many stops between here and London, journey times to London will be no faster than they are now.’"

The firms are harvesting information via popular health and fitness apps available in the UK including jogging app MapMyRun. The apps are used by fitness fans to track their exercise sessions and record information such as running times. Privacy problems: Many popular apps that record fitness levels are passing on information to insurance companies Many will be unaware that their details are being passed on to companies including advertisers and digital analytic groups. Research published yesterday suggests that that the 20 most visited apps transmit information to a web of nearly 70 companies. The findings, by web analytics and privacy group Evidon, have been criticised by campaigners who said it presented a ‘stark warning’ to users of the apps. Emma Carr of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘With some applications’ terms and conditions reading longer than a Shakespearean play, it is no wonder that the developers are able to hide behind small print and legal jargon. ‘If people don’t understand what is happening to their personal information, how are they supposed to make an informed choice about whether to use a service? Hidden monitoring: Campaigners say the research presented a 'stark warning' to users ‘The developers of these sorts of applications are putting their own interests before the privacy of their users, highlighting that consumers need proper protection from terms and conditions that are either too intrusive or too unclear to understand.’ The study comes after another investigation found creators of smartphone apps were not explaining privacy risk to customers properly. Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an advocacy group, found ‘considerable privacy risks’ not described in privacy policies when they analysed 43 popular health and fitness apps. The report read: ‘Consumers should not assume any of their data are private in the mobile app environment - even health data that they consider sensitive.’ The Evidon study found that information from MapMyRun, which allows joggers to record the length and pace of their running, is passed on to third parties. Data was passed to 11 different firms, including advertising companies, some of which are subsidiaries of Google, and other digital analytics and tracking groups. Experts are now warning that it may set a dangerous precedent and allow companies to use the information against people in future. Risk: The research showed that very few customers understood their details were being passed on to third parties If health and fitness information were to be passed to insurance companies, they could use it to set premium prices. Leon Atkinson-Derman, chief executive of Winkpass Creations, maker of a menstrual cycle tracking app called iPeriod, said insurance companies were a real threat. He told the Financial Times: ‘If an insurance company were to want to buy iPeriod, I’d say no.‘The fact of the matter is, insurance companies are trying to learn things about people and use it against them.’ MapMyFitness, another exercise app, already earns half of its revenue from partnerships with insurance companies and says it benefits its users. It built a special platform for US-based company Humana, which mimics the fitness and calorie tracking features of MapMyFitness, the first of its kind for an insurance company. Humana offers this to the members of its employee health plans. When users meet certain fitness benchmarks, they are offered discounts on premiums or certain employers offer rewards such as holidays. Many of the app and third party companies say they do not sell information about their users and any user information transmitted is not personally identifiable. They say information is more typically used to improve their own apps. However, some companies, including iPeriod, are exploring ways of using personal data inputted into apps to target advertising at users. For example, a woman who records in the app that she gets headaches before her period could soon receive an ad for a pain reliever at just the right time of the month."

Blaec Lammers told investigators he went to the Walmart in Bolivar in October 2009 looking for an ‘easy victim’ after watching the horror film Halloween, saying that watching the main character, Michael Myers, killing people ‘got him to thinking,’ the arrest report said. Lammers told authorities he watched the clerk for more than two hours. He said he was planning to follow the electronics department clerk into a storage room and kill him when he heard his name over the public address system and his father calling his name, according to the report. Arrested: Blaec Lammers, 20, is accused of planning to launch shooting sprees in Bolivar, Missouri No charges were filed in that case. Instead, Lammers, who was 17 at the time, was committed for 96 hours for a mental health examination, Polk County prosecutor Ken Ashlock said Tuesday. Ashlock, who was not the county's prosecutor in 2009, said he didn't know what happened after the commitment. Lammers, now 20, made his first court appearance Tuesday in the movie theater case and was ordered to undergo a mental health exam. Lammers, who is being held on a $500,000 bond, is charged with first-degree assault, making a terroristic threat and armed criminal action. His public defender, DeWayne Franklin Perry, declined comment Tuesday. His mother, who contacted police last week out of concern her son was planning a shooting, said Tuesday that he has shown signs of Asperger's syndrome, borderline personality disorder and other conditions. She said her son has had inpatient treatment in the past. ‘He didn't ask to be born different. He grew up his whole life in (his sister) Kristyn's shadow. He wanted to be successful and be somebody,’ Tricia Lammers said during a news conference at the National Alliance for Mental Illness in Springfield, KLOR-TV reported. ‘Just two weeks ago he asked me - both my kids still call me mommy - he said, `Mommy, do you think I'm a failure?’ I said, “No Blaec, I don't.”’ Her son was arrested last week after she told police she was concerned he ‘may have intentions of shooting people’ during the opening weekend of the last instalment in the popular vampire movie franchise. According to a police probable cause statement, she said she believed her son had amassed weapons similar to those used by the gunman who attacked a theater in Aurora, Colorado, during the latest Batman movie in July. That attack killed 12 people. 'Mentally ill': The 20-year-old is said to have suffered from depression and been off his medication Investigators later determined Lammers had recently purchased two assault rifles and 400 rounds of ammunition. Lammers' parents also tipped off authorities about the previous Walmart incident. The 2009 police report said Lammers' mother called authorities after finding a suicide note from her son and a missing kitchen knife. An officer was en route when the mother said her son's vehicle had been found in the parking lot of the Walmart store in Bolivar, a town about 130 miles southeast of Kansas City. The parents said in 2009 that Lammers had been diagnosed with depression, and his mother said Lammers had an appointment that day with his psychologist and ‘he has been acting different since then.’ According to a probable cause statement in the movie theater case, Lammers was questioned Thursday afternoon and told authorities he bought tickets to a Sunday Twilight screening in Bolivar and planned to shoot people inside. Lammers also said he planned to ‘just start shooting people at random’ at the Walmart store less than a mile away, so if he ran out of bullets, he could ‘just break the glass where the ammunition is being stored and get some more and keep shooting until police arrived,’ investigators wrote. The probable cause statement said Lammers was ‘off of his medication,’ but his mother said Tuesday that to her knowledge, that wasn't true. The 20-year-old admitted to police that he was inspired by a number of well-publicized mass shootings, such as James Holmes' attack on a theater showing The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado in July. Lammers was reported to police by his mother, according to the Springfield News-Leader, after she became concerned when he bought two guns despite never having been shooting before. 'Quiet': The suspect described himself as a 'loner' and admitted he had had 'homicidal thoughts' She said they reminded her of the weapons used in the Aurora shooting, in which 12 audience members were killed, and feared her son might be planning a similar atrocity. He voluntarily attended an interview with Bolivar police, and initially claimed that he had bought the guns in order to go hunting. But when officers brought up well-known gun massacres, Lammers 'stated that he had a lot in common with the people that have been involved in those shootings', according to a police report. Lammers then confessed he had bought two assault rifles and 400 rounds of ammunition with the intention of shooting movie-goers at the Twilight screening on Sunday, to which he had already bought a ticket. He visited a nearby town earlier this week to practice shooting at a range. The suspect also said he was thinking about going to the local branch of Walmart to 'just start shooting people at random', so that he would have access to extra ammunition if he ran out of bullets. On Friday morning, Lammers was charged with first-degree assault, making a terrorist threat and armed criminal action, according to court documents. Death: Lammers had bought a ticket to the new Twilight film where he planned to launch his massacre Inspiration: Lammers planned to imitate James Holmes, who killed 12 movie-goers in Aurora, Colorado 'Thankfully we had a responsible family member or we might have had a different outcome,' Bolivar police chief Steve Hamilton said. He said Lammers is under a doctor's care for mental illness, and court documents said he was 'off of his medication.' Mr Hamilton said it appeared that Lammers obtained the firearms legally but that police were continuing to investigate 'to determine how in fact he was able to obtain a permit.' Ashley Miller, who lives in a nearby town, said she has known Lammers for about a year and described him as 'one of the sweetest guys I had ever met' but 'very emotional,' noting he would periodically stop talking to her. She said he told her that he had bounced between relatives growing up. As an adult, he bounced between girlfriends, she said. 'He was never actually happy,' she added. 'I think he had depression or something.'"

Herbert Hale lives on a check of a little less than $17 a week and whatever he can pick up from odd jobs. CHERRY CREEK, South Dakota (CNN) -- The tiny one-room house rests on a hill; no electricity and no running water. A creaky metal cot and a rusting wood-burning stove is all the comfort Herbert Hale says he needs. ""All it is is logs, glue -- dirt and water put together -- then cement and the chicken string,"" Hale says of his home. ""Long as the windows don't break, it's nice and warm in here."" The roof leaks a bit, and the floorboards are rotted in one corner, but Hale isn't one to complain. ""It's home,"" he says, almost under his breath, as he invites a visitor to have a look. Firewood is stacked in one corner inside, and more outside as Hale uses the summer months to stockpile for prairie winters, where 20 below zero is not all that uncommon. He also pulls bunches of long weeds in the prairie grass, to dry for use as a firestarter. ""I have to be careful,"" Hale says matter-of-factly as he pulls a few fistfuls. ""Sometimes there are some snakes. Rattlesnakes. Nothing to mess around with."" He is 54 years old, a member of the Lakota tribe and part of two stunning statistics, even as communities across America deal with the pain and challenges of recession: Hale worked 16 years as a firefighter. But he began having some back problems in the early 1980s and then, ""cancer caught up with me. I have a brain tumor."" He says he gets a check for just shy of $17 every week from a tribal welfare fund, and tries to find odd jobs to pay for his food and to help out a diabetic sister. But there's a catch: Tiny Cherry Creek has no such jobs. There are one or two one-room homes like Hale's, but it is mostly a collection of a couple dozen simple modular homes provided by a federal and tribal housing program. It doesn't even have a gas station or general store. So Hale heads out most days toward Eagle Butte -- 17 miles up one road and then 21 miles more up the next. A few more twists and, ""It's about 42 to 43 miles, someplace around there."" Herbert Hale can't afford a car. ""Well, I take off, go to my sister's, then get some water and take off. Somebody along the way will pick me up."" Often, that somebody is Bryce In The Woods, a member of the tribal council whose district includes Cherry Creek. ""It is bad,"" he says of the area's economic plight, walking a visitor through the gravel streets where many residents, idle because of the lack of jobs, are sitting out front or shout out a greeting from inside their small homes. To spend a day crossing the reservation is to see a place stunningly beautiful and seemingly forgotten all at once, small, poor communities tucked into the hollows of western South Dakota's Cheyenne River Reservation. The poverty is all the more striking because of the richness of the setting: green and golden rolling hills, roaming horses and cattle, and tall corn and golden sunflowers sprouting from the fertile soil. ""Ziebach County is the No. 1 county statistically with child poverty,"" he said. ""Now that alone is generational, with the trauma of poverty and the broken family."" Breaking that cycle is Bryce In The Woods' obsession. He highlights a bright spot: A building in the community converted to a makeshift classroom and library where residents can get tutoring help and then take the GED --- the high school equivalency exam. ""It is so difficult,"" he says of the challenge facing younger reservation residents. ""Some of our young people join the services, the armed services, some of them go to college or apply to college,"" Bryce In The Woods told us. ""The majority, if they are staying here, end up moving to Rapid City or some of the bigger cities to try to find employment."" In Eagle Butte, the largest community on the reservation, a bustling construction site is a new source of pride. A medical center is under construction, thanks to funding from the Obama administration's stimulus plan, and Bryce In The Woods says about 65 construction-related jobs so far have gone to tribal members. ""At this point I am very appreciative of what we have received,"" Joseph Brings Plenty, the elected tribal chairman, says when we ask if the stimulus funding is enough. ""But as far as expectation, I can say no. There would be a lot more need to be fulfilled by the U.S. government for our tribe before I can say yes."" Outside, Brings Plenty's office is a ""First Americans for Obama"" sign -- a reminder the tribe was an early backer of Barack Obama. Brings Plenty says he hopes the president remembers. ""I can sympathize, empathize, with the demands, with the pressures that are on his shoulders, on his plate and put in front of him,"" Brings Plenty said during a break from a Tribal Council meeting. The biggest help Obama and Congress could give, the chairman and others told us, is greater water rights. The tribe has money for more housing, but can't build because the water pressure is too low and its treatment systems too outdated to handle increased demand. ""I feel that we are forgotten because we don't have that voice out there,"" Chairman Brings Plenty said. ""It's demoralizing in a way for some of our members that go out and receive an education and come back and are unable to get a job here."" To be clear, Chairman Brings Plenty and Bryce In the Woods say not all of the tribe's problems rest with the federal government. Both mentioned obstacles and disagreements born of factional tribal politics and rivalries, which were in full evidence during just a few minutes of the Tribal Council's debate. In The Woods is also a strong advocate for land reforms he says would get the tribe a better deal for grazing rights on its property. Still, they would welcome more economic development help, from the state and from Washington, but say their voices don't always get heard, even in the best of times. ""When it comes down to a vote, a lot of the urban representatives, I don't think they really know the plight on the reservation,"" Bryce In the Woods said. ""I think there is a stereotype out there that all tribes have casinos and that's not true."" Herbert Hale shrugs when asked if Washington has a responsibility to help his struggling community. ""I can't really say,"" he said quietly. ""I'm not into politics to tell you the truth. I was when I was younger, back in the '80s."" Now, he lives the simplest of lives. A few hours of work if he is lucky, and perhaps an hour or two collecting wood, even in the scorching August sun. The temperature neared 100 degrees on the day of our visit, yet Hale's wood stove was warm to the touch. Prairie mornings can still be chilly. More important, memories of winter's past remind Hale of the value of his growing stockpile. ""Sometimes it's a long walk,"" he says. ""Especially in February. Twenty below and I have to walk. Often no cars ... A few times I felt like falling asleep on the road. I told myself, 'Fall asleep, you're froze and you're gone.' I pushed myself to keep walking."" Once home, he has a battery-powered radio and uses a small kerosene lamp to pass time at night reading. He's extra careful because he recently broke its glass chimney, so the flame burns without protection from the winds that can pick up suddenly. Herbert's worries are more immediate than whether the president or any other politician understands his plight. ""They never stopped up here,"" he says.""If they did, I wasn't home."" On the odd jobs in town, $1 here and $5 there adds up -- not too much, but his goals are modest. ""You know, take the trash out. I sweep the front. A few dollars a day wouldn't hurt. That's as good as you need. That's all I care about. One day at a time."""

Scroll down for video Striking gold: One of these dresses is £249 from M&S, but Victoria's design is almost three times as much I felt so fabulously ‘Veebs’ wearing these gold dresses that I didn’t even feel absurd wearing sunglasses indoors – a look Victoria has been not-quite-perfecting since her Spice Girl days. I’m not sure how many non-famous people could get away with wearing a leather dress outside of my stomping ground of Soho, but this was definitely my favourite. Fit for a duchess: This lilac dress is a little demure for a girl about town, but Kate could pull it off VVB’s crepe-silk lilac dress is so genuinely posh I can easily imagine the Duchess of Cambridge slipping into it for Royal functions. But it’s a little demure for a Girl Tottering About Town and the fabric was so delicate I creased it just by looking at it. Realistically, only someone with a ladies’ maid could rely on this dress as a wardrobe staple. For the red carpet: One of these almost-identical dresses is 27 times more expensive than the other After years of red carpet events and premieres (darling) I thought I’d developed a serious case of expensive taste, so I was surprised to find I preferred the cheap dress to Victoria’s. Probably a good thing, because although I party with the stars, I don’t have the budget of one. A wag's whitemare: This ensemble feels a little Posh Spice circa 2006 when she was crowned Queen WAG I did NOT feel very posh wearing Victoria’s bodycon white dress with a sheer panel. In fact, I felt like Posh Spice circa 2006, the year she was crowned Queen WAG at the World Cup for wearing outfits so skimpy that her boobs practically fell out. By comparison, the Jane Norman imitation felt almost luxurious. Both are the kind of dresses I’d expect to see worn on TOWIE – or at Aintree’s infamously naff Ladies’ Day. Loving the LBD: These little black dresses will make you feel a million dollars and could bag you a footballer I felt a million dollars in this little black dress. So much so, I half-expected a multi-millionaire former footballer and national treasure to materialise and take my arm. Sadly, even this exquisitely made dress couldn’t work miracles. But if you want to bag a footballer, remember – VB did so in hotpants, not an LBD. Dinnerlady chic: Maybe Victoria thinks that this apron-inspired look will catch on? At the risk of getting myself struck off the guestlist for Victoria’s launch party, I think she has had a private chef for too long. She has clearly forgotten what a dinnerlady looks like, or maybe she thinks ‘Apron Chic’ will catch on. Then again, I doubt Veebs does much washing up – perhaps that’s why she didn’t notice her dress looks like a tea towel.

Dubbed one of the world's most expensive suits, it sold at an auction Friday. It cost a cool 43.1 million rupees, Surat District Magistrate Rajender Kumar said. The suit is a popular icon. In addition to belonging to Modi,  it had his name embroidered in golden pinstripe all over it. That had the whole nation cackling about an outrageous fashion faux pas. Wearing it while meeting Obama made the sartorial choice even more provocative. Opposition leaders accused him of being narcissistic, one politician even labeled him a ""megalomaniac."" Much of the Indian public wasn't too pleased either, questioning his image of a humble man he proudly portrayed during the 2014 general elections. The infamous monogrammed suit went on auction with bidders from all over the country tussling for the prized possession. Its original price was U.S.$16,084 - and officials expected it to shoot up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The proceeds of this year's auction are supposed to go toward Modi's ambitious pet project of cleaning India's holy river, the Ganges. The suit was just one of the 455 items up for grabs. Other items include gifts and mementos that Modi received from foreign dignitaries and national leaders. According to organizers, the auction which is being held in Modi's home state of Gujarat has been extremely successful. ""There is a lot of interest among the general public, and we are seeing multiple bids for a lot of items,"" Kumar said. Modi held similar auctions when he was the chief minister of Gujarat and raised funds for the education of young girls in the state."

Images of the striker were splashed across the Shanghai team's official website Monday, together with a statement saying the 32-year-old would be joining the club in January on a two-year contract. The move was later confirmed by Chelsea, who signed Anelka for Â£15 million in 2008 but accepted his transfer request with his current deal to expire at the end of this season. ""This is not only good for Shenhua but also beneficial for Chinese football,"" club spokesperson Ma Yue told CNN. ""The joining of Anelka to Football Association Super League will promote the League's brand for sure."" No details were given about how much the contract was worth, but a club official denied reports that Anelka's weekly salary would be as high as Â£200,000 ($312,000). Anelka has rarely featured for Chelsea this season under new manager Andre Villas-Boas, and was almost certain to leave Stamford Bridge during European football's January transfer window after asking to leave. The Versailles-born player, who became a Muslim in 2004, has scored 59 goals in 184 games for the club. Having played for some of Europe's top teams, including Spain's Real Madrid and England's Arsenal and Liverpool, Anelka's transfers have so far totaled almost $133 million, making him one of the world's most expensive players in those terms. However, his questionable attitude during his early career led to him being nicknamed ""Le Sulk"" at Arsenal and being banned for 45 days at Real after refusing to train. In 2008, Anelka moved to Chelsea in a Â£15 million deal from Bolton, where he resurrected his career after a short spell in Turkey with Fenerbahce. He helped the London club win the domestic championship in 2009-10. Anelka's international career came to a controversial halt during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, when he was sent home in disgrace after clashing with coach Raymond Domenech. He was given an 18-match ban after refusing to apologize, but said he had already decided to retire from the national team. Reports have also linked Shenhua with another veteran Chelsea striker, Didier Drogba -- a target of Chinese rivals Dalian Aerbin. Meanwhile, Shenhua owner Zhu Jun said last week that former France international Jean Tigana will become the club's new coach, according to the Shanghai Daily website. ""Tigana should be in the city by the middle of this month. He had already made a one-year coaching plan for the team,"" Zhu said. Shenhua finished 11th in the 16-team Chinese Super League this year, having been runners-up in 2005, 2006 and 2008. CNN's Haolan Hong contributed to this report."

The Defense Department Inspector General said dozens of contractors worked in sensitive positions without security clearances or the official passes they needed. And some of those people, according to the report, were allowed to remain on the job even after inspectors uncovered the security problems. The report says a company called Combat Support Associates (CSA) was awarded the contract in 1999 for what was called Combat Support Services Contract-Kuwait (CSSC-K). The contract was extended and is due to expire at the end of September after costing the government more than $3.3 billion dollars. ""CSSC-K contractor employees occupied sensitive positions such as force protection officers, system administrators, and supply inspectors in Kuwait without obtaining security clearances,"" the report says. The department's inspector general says the company's security office failed to track 21 of 379 employees who were in sensitive positions, such as ammunition supply, and that 11 employees did not have a valid security clearance. In addition there was no information whether some of the employees had a U.S. passport, although U.S. citizenship was required by the contract ""Additionally, CSA officials allowed 20 employees to remain in sensitive positions without the required security clearance after its internal quality assurance office and DCMA ( the Defense Contract Management Agency, overseeing the contract) officials informed CSA officials that they were in violation of the contract,"" the report says. ""If DCMA and contractor officials do not ensure that all employees have the required security clearances and maintain proper security information, they jeopardize the military mission and threaten the safety and security of the military, civilian, and contractor personnel in Kuwait."" CNN was unable to contact representatives of the contractor. The inspector general's report says the company claims it did not understand the terms of the agreement. ""According to CSA's human resources information system analyst, the Army did not clearly define or designate all sensitive positions; therefore, CSA officials relied on their own department managers to determine which positions required a security clearance,"" the report says. And the report suggests the Army and Pentagon's oversight of the contract may have been lacking. ""If the Army does not ensure that all contractor employees have the required security clearances and maintain proper security information, these employees pose a threat to the military, civilian, and U.S. contractor personnel in Kuwait, as well as to national security,"" the report says"

The grueling three week-test over 3,664 kilometers, taking in the unforgiving mountains of the Alps and Pyrenees, will finish in Paris on July 27, but in recent years Le Grand Depart has often taken place outside of France to widen the appeal of cycling's most iconic race. Beating off bids from Florence and Edinburgh, Yorkshire -- which at 15,000 square kilometers and with a population of five million is the biggest county in England -- got the nod from race organizers in 2012. Its biggest city Leeds will host the start of two days of racing in Yorkshire with the first stage finishing in Harrogate and the second going from the cathedral city of York to Sheffield. It will pass through the Yorkshire Dales, the Peak District and the Pennines, with stiff climbs that will provide an early test for the 198 riders from 22 teams teams of nine. The second leg Sunday will indeed see the peloton speed through the small town of Haworth where the Bronte's -- Charlotte, Emily and Ann -- lived in the early 19th century. Their most famous works, Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and the Tenant of Wildfell Hall are literary classics set against the backdrop of the wild and windswept moors that surround their birthplace in the West Riding. Local organizers are banking that the worldwide appeal of the Tour will showcase the history and heritage of their region -- dubbed ""God's own county"" by locals -- and attract new tourism. If the huge crowds which greeted the last visit of Le Grand Boucle to Britain in 2007 are anything to go by, that is pretty much guaranteed. All over Yorkshire, Haworth included, towns and cities on the route are bedecked with welcoming signs and references to the unique magic of a race which started in 1903 with the aim of boosting the circulation of a French newspaper L'Auto and has grown to become the biggest spectator event in the sporting calendar. ""The race has excited the public and cycling community and is the biggest sporting event to take place anywhere in the UK in 2014,"" said Larry Hickmott, the editor of the website VeloUK.net and a veteran observer of the British cycling scene. Over a million people are expected to line the roads for the two stages in Yorkshire and the third from Cambridge to the British capital London, before the race heads to its traditional home in France for the remaining 18 stages. The pre-race buildup has been dominated by a row over the decision to leave Britain's most famous cyclist, Bradley Wiggins, out of the Team Sky lineup. Wiggins made history when he won the 2012 edition of the Tour before going on to claim Olympic gold a week later at the London Games. With his trademark sideburns and 'Mod' fashion sense, Wiggins assumed cult status and became a national hero, but his ongoing rivalry with fellow Team Sky member Chris Froome has since taken on the sort of brooding intrigue which would not have been out of place in a Bronte novel. Froome, who had been his right hand man in helping Wiggins win the 2012 Tour, still finishing a fine second, duly won last year's race, with Wiggins absent after illness and crashes in an abortive attempt at claiming the preceding Giro d'Italia. Wiggins might have been expected to return to the Team Sky squad this year, particularly with the race starting in Britain, but instead has been left on the sidelines. His devoted fans believe Froome -- who has been quoted as calling his teammate ""mentally weak"" -- played a part in his exclusion, but this is denied by the Kenyan-born British rider. ""Just to make it absolutely clear, I do not have a role in selection,"" Froome told gathered reporters ahead of the start. Team Sky chief Dave Brailsford said the decision had ""kept him awake at night, but lauded the 29-year-old Froome as the ""the best stage race rider in the world."" Either way, while Froome and his eight teammates begin their quest to bring Team Sky a third straight yellow jersey, Wiggins will likely be training at the Manchester Velodrome ahead of riding the 4km individual and team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. ""The most popular opinion is that Wiggins should ride, both from public and avid cycling fans and even many of 'informed' inside the sport,"" said Hickmott, who has followed his career since he was a youngster. But to understand while Wiggins -- who may well have been capable of finishing on the podium -- has been left out it is necessary to examine the dynamics of a cycling team in its approach to races like the Tour de France. The entire Team Sky squad will act as ""domestiques"" or helpers for Froome, sacrificing their own chances to help him claim the yellow jersey in Paris. At best, Wiggins would have been a ""super domestique"" -- which is a rider who might be expected to step up to the plate if a mishap or illness befell the team leader Froome. Brailsford has given his role to Australian Richie Porte, hailing the Tasmanian as a ""Grand Tour winner of the future"" but has courted further controversy by leaving out young British stars Peter Kennaugh and Ben Swift, who finished first and second at their national championship last weekend. With Swift omitted it will leave Team Sky without a recognized sprinter, the riders designated to contest the bunch finishes at the end of predominantly flat stages. Despite its recent dominance of cycling at the Tour de France and in the Olympics, Britain will only have four competitors in this year's race, but in Froome and sprint king Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-Quick Step) it has two jewels in the crown. Cavendish, who has used his finishing speed to win 25 Tour de France stages, will be hoping his teammates can help him don the yellow jersey after the first stage which finishes in his mother's home town of Harrogate. Last year's green jersey winner Peter Sagan of Slovakia and Germans Andre Greipel and Marcel Kittel will be his main challengers in these finishes -- with all looking to win the coveted final stage on the Champs Elysees in the French capital. But the fastest men on two wheels are not contenders for the overall crown, usually losing time on the mountain stages and the individual time trials which decide that ultimate honor. Froome has proved his worth in both those disciplines, winning the 2013 Tour by over four minutes from Nairo Quintana of the Movistar team. Colombian Quintana won the Giro d'Italia earlier this year, but has decided against a tilt at the Tour, leaving two-time winner Alberto Contador as the likely main challenger to Froome. Contador courted controversy after a positive drugs test which annulled his 2010 Tour triumph and the Spaniard has struggled to repeat his earlier victories since serving his ban, but impressive performances in 2014 serve notice of his abilities. The 31-year-old always protested his innocence after failing a doping control for the banned stimulant Clenbuterol, but his presence as a podium contender will act as a constant reminder that cycling is still struggling to shrug off the doping controversies which have continually haunted the sport. On the eve of the tour came the revelation that Daryl Impey, the first South African to wear the yellow jersey last year, had tested positive back in February after his national championships for a banned substance Probenecid. He was withdrawn from the race by his Orica-Green EDGE team while Froome, who has known Impey since his time in school in South Africa, said that the news was a ""big shock to me."" Tour de France organizers will be hoping this year's event passes off without a further doping story, preferring the positive images of massive crowds lining the route in both Britain and France to cheer on their heroes rather than the darker side of the sport."

While contestants of the BBC television show failed to impress in one of the episodes with their confectionery brand, which was criticized for having too many product offerings, little Mollie Price has concentrated on British sweets and American candy. She is now celebrating the launch of her third shop called 'Mollie's' in the Welsh market town of Welshpool. Sweet success: Mollie, aged six, pictured in one of her three confectionery shops In recognition of her business achievements she has been declared one of the youngest entrepreneurs in the UK. With the help of her mother Becky, she recently opened her third store in Shrewsbury’s Pride Hill Shopping Centre to add to two existing branches on Welshpool High Street and in Newtown’s Bear Lanes Shopping Centre. Her mother says Mollie - who organises and selects all of the stock for each of the branches - is now determined to expand her empire. Becky said: 'It might sound crazy but believe Mollie is the real brains behind the operation. It was Mollie’s idea to set up the shop. She used to love going to pic n mix places and saw there was a gap in the market for it.' All of the stores are organised and stocked by Mollie Good work ethic: According to mother Becky (right) Mollie works in one of the stores every Saturday 'She works in one of the stores on Saturday and wakes up at 5am every Sunday ready to go to our wholesale suppliers in Birmingham to restock. She asks her friends to test the sweets to decide which ones are good. 'She has plans to expand the business and we might be setting up a new store. She’s definitely leaning towards a career in business and she has plans to take over the sweet shops when she’s older. It’s been a great learning experience for her.' Honouring her favourite film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Mollie has included a plethora of Wonka products. And at the entrance to the shops are two large tin soldiers standing guard named after her two brothers Alfie and George. Becky adds: 'If she doesn’t think an idea will work she will say so. By listening to Mollie we are making sure our shops appeal to all ages. 'She came up with the idea of a temperature chart on the wall so if it’s really cold we sell our Mr Whippy ice creams cheaper than when it’s hot outside.'

The gang targeted both dealers and private sellers around Yorkshire and Derbyshire, stealing a total of 23 new and second hand cars worth almost £300,000 including a £28,440 Land Rover, £15,750 Audi and a Mercedes C220 sports car. They would arrange for test drives in secluded areas before stealing the cars using a variety of methods to distract salesman or the owners. Ringleaders: Dean Harding, 33, (left) and Ernest Moate, 61, (right) were part of a criminal gang which arranged test-drive more than 20 high-value cars before distracting the salesmen and driving off Most of the cars taken by the gang between January and April last year were quickly stripped down for parts and only three were recovered. Jailing three of the gang members, Recorder Richard Wright QC told Leeds Crown Court that he was satisfied Ernest Moate, 61, and Dean Harding, 33, played the leading roles in the operation, with Harding the main thief supported by Moate and another man, Richard MacInnes, 38. Gang members would approach car dealerships or private sellers advertising on Autotrader or Gumtree, with the caller giving a false name and background explaining why he wanted the car. Often the caller would pretend to be working as a contractor somewhere remote in Yorkshire or Derbyshire, asking the seller to to bring a vehicle to him for a test drive. The court was told that one of the thefts took place on Janurary 31 last year, when a salesman from the Farnell Land Rover dealership in Bradford dealership was tricked into taking a £28,440 Land Rover to a farm in the village Denby Dale after a potential buyer claimed he was doing some logging in the area. There he met Harding, who was using a false name, and together they drove five miles to nearby Bretton before pulling into a layby. After distracting the salesman, Harding made a dash for the vehicle and sped off. Gang members: A stolen Land Rover was traced to a garage belonging to Daniel Banks, 24, (left). He was jailed for 18 months for handling stolen vehicles, while Richard MacInnes, 38, (right) was jailed for two years, four months for conspiracy to steal vehicles and failing to attend court Stolen:  A salesman from a Bradford dealership was tricked into taking this £28,440 Land Rover for a test drive, only for it to be stolen by Harding. By the time it was found in Banks's garage it had been fitted with false number plates and the doors and bonnet had been removed Matthew Donkin, prosecuting, said the salesman alerted his manager and because the vehicle had been fitted with a tracker, activated after the theft was reported, police traced it to a garage belonging to another gang member Daniel Banks, 24, within half an hour. By then the car had been fitted with false number plates was already being stripped down, with the bonnet and doors missing. On February 8 last year another garage, Perry’s Motors in Huddersfield, was contacted by a man who asked for a vehicle to be taken to a quarry at Grange Moor. When the salesman arrived with a Vauxhall Astra a man matching Harding’s description got in for a test drive. He drove to a gated driveway and while the salesman was out to open the gates, Harding drove away. The vehicle was never recovered. The court heard that a private seller in Holmfirth was also contacted about a test drive of his £15,750 Audi, but when the seller went to lock his front door the man drove off in the car. Other cars stolen in the operation included a Mitsubishi LC200, a £14,990 Mercedes C220 sports car, a Ford Transit van worth £20,000, a Range Rover Sport worth £29,000 and a £22,000 Mitsubishi Barbarian. Ringleader Moate, described in court as a 'professional criminal' was jailed for five and a half years after he was convicted of conspiracy to steal motor vehicles. MacInnes was jailed for two years, four months for conspiracy to steal vehicles and failing to attend court, and Banks was jailed for 18 months for handling stolen vehicles. All lived in Barnsley. Harding had been sentenced at a previous hearing when he was jailed for three years and four months for conspiracy to steal vehicles, handling and robbery. Four other gang members were also sentenced for their part in the thefts. Brett Williams, 24, was jailed for two years for handling stolen goods and Robert West, 28, was given a 15 months sentence suspended for two years with 300 hours unpaid work for handling stolen goods. Craig Williams, 25, and Gary Williams, 32, who were each given 10 months in prison suspended for two years with 200 hours unpaid work for handling stolen goods. 'We worked for several months to investigate these offences and as we dug further it became increasingly apparent there were clear links between what at first seemed like isolated offences committed across the Yorkshire region,' said Detective Constable James Bellhouse, who headed the investigation, named Operation Trimgill. 'The investigation was extremely complex and our enquiries included visiting scenes, recovering and viewing hours of CCTV, house to house, forensic opportunities, receiving and evaluating intelligence obtaining and executing warrants, mobile phone work, liaising with other forces, surveillance and also a bit of luck. 'It highlights once again that today’s criminals can operate in a sophisticated fashion, targeting those who are vulnerable. It also demonstrates how well police officers can collaborate across districts and indeed police force areas to catch them.'"

Jennifer Garcia, case coordinator at California-based surrogacy service Extraordinary Conceptions, says about 55 per cent of her clients are Chinese. 'I've heard Harvard mentioned, Yale, Princeton. They just want them to come here and get a great education,' Ms Garcia told Today, 'and by them being a United States citizen they're not going to have a problem to come back and get accepted to those colleges.' Scroll down for video Happy family: Linda (left) and her husband are one of the many Chinese couples paying American surrogates to have their babies, a process which can cost upwards of $120,000 Chinese-American: One surrogacy agency reports that 55 per cent of their clientele are Chinese nationals. Above, Linda and her husband's American born baby All this is possible thanks to the fourteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution which guarantees citizenship to any child born on American soil. Surrogacy also allows parents to 'design' their babies. For mothers whose eggs are unusable, parents can chose a surrogate with specific physical traits. Garcia says tall, blonde women are popular among her Chinese clients. Jennifer Garcia is a case coordinator at surrogacy agency Extraordinary Conceptions. She says that many Chinese are turning to American surrogacy as a way to increase the odds of getting into an Ivy League school Parents can also chose the baby's gender, a big perk for Chinese parents who generally prefer boys due to the country's one-child policy. Surrogacy is also a way to get around that one-child policy. Some Chinese who already have a child of their own are turning to surrogacy as a way to grow their family without drawing the ire of the Communist Party. While having a baby through surrogacy is still a violation of the one-child rule, the government is having trouble enforcing the rule. When the baby is finally born, most agencies work to secure American birth certificates, social security cards and passports for the bi-national infant before their leave the country. Altogether, Ms Garcia estimates that it costs anywhere from $120,000-$140,000 for Chinese couples to have an American surrogate baby, meaning it's still only an option for the very wealthiest. Which explains another reason why Chinese are turning to American surrogates specifically as opposed to surrogates in other countries. Some wealthy Chinese fear they will be targeted if there was ever social unrest in the country again. They believe an American baby will give them a way out of the country. Americans can apply for green cards for their parents once they turn 21. But for many Chinese, American surrogacy isn't about citizenship options - it's a shot at parenthood for those who can't have children. Parenthood: Surrogacy is illegal in China, so after Linda figured out that she couldn't have a child herself - American surrogacy was one of the only options Since surrogacy is illegal in China, infertile Chinese don't have many options for having a biological child. A Chinese woman named Linda had a disease four years ago which resulted in her loss of fertility. Linda and her husband then decided to turn to U.S. surrogacy and now have a child of their own. 'Without her, we can't get our baby,' Linda said of her surrogate. Some of the American women who have served as surrogates talk about feeling 'fulfilled' in giving a child to a couple who wouldn't have had one otherwise given their country's strict population-control. 'I could not live me life without my three children and the thought of giving that to somebody else is really the main reason why I did it,' a surrogate named Janice said. Service: American surrogate Janice is proud to be able to provide a child to a Chinese couple who wouldn't otherwise be parents due to the country's trick population policies"

His lawyer has submitted surveillance video from a local shop which he claims shows his client being viciously attacked by two officers. Scroll down for video Kyle Howell from Westbury, New York, suffered a broken nose, bone fractures near both eyes and facial nerve damage as a result of the April 25 incident Court records show Howell was charged with assaulting the officers, tampering with physical evidence and resisting arrest, among others. Police alleged in felony complaints that Howell tried to eat a bag of marijuana and punched and kicked them after ‘a violent struggle ensued as officers attempted to retrieve the evidence’ and arrest him. Police also alleged potential evidence was partially destroyed by the time they subdued Howell, who caused injuries to the officers that required hospital treatment. They also charged him with marijuana possession and criminal possession of a controlled substance after reportedly finding a small bag allegedly containing cocaine during a search of Howell's 2002 Honda. Security video footage shows one of the two officers rush to the drivers seat when Howell is sat and start kicking and punching him in such a manner that the cars rocks ‘I remember getting a knee to my face and after that, I don’t really remember much. I was hit in the head so many times,’ Howell told CBS New York. ‘They were telling me to spit something out of my mouth.’ Howell denies that claims. He was release on $10,000 bond following a hospital arraignment. Attorney Amy Marion filed a legal claim against the county on Monday seeking unspecified damages. It claims that Howell was the victim of false arrest, excessive police force, and deprived of his civil rights, including by Nassau University Medical Center employees who concealed illegal police behavior. After seeing the video, prosecutors have launched a probe and police internal affairs investigators also are looking into the officers' actions. Eleven days since the incident and Kyle Howell's eyes remained bloodshot during a news conference on Tuesday in Garden City, N.Y. At Tuesday press conference, Kyle was joined by his father and mother, Donovan and Joan Howell, and attorney Steven Gaitman ‘We've seen this video and have been investigating both the actions of the officers as well as the charges that the police filed against Mr. Howell,’ said Nassau District Attorney Kathleen Rice. The officers involved have been identified as Vincent Logiudice and Basil Gomez, reports Newsday. Both officers are on modified duty where they don't have contact with the public and can't earn overtime pending the outcome of the internal affairs probe, Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter said. Nassau County police have not commented, citing pending litigation. Howell conceded he was arrested twice in 2012 and pleaded guilty to petty larceny and marijuana possession. Howell is then dragged from the vehicle and charged with assaulting the officers, tampering with physical evidence and resisting arrest"

Bruce Castor also told CNN that he believed Cosby -- a beloved figure who, with his wit and boyish smile, has charmed audiences as a family-friendly stand-up comic, the voice of Fat Albert, the host of ""Picture Pages"" and the star of a wildly popular eponymous sitcom -- lied to authorities. In January 2004, Andrea Constand, then a 31-year-old staffer for the women's basketball team at Temple University, Cosby's alma mater, was at the comedian's Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, home when Cosby provided her medication that made her dizzy, she alleged the following year. She later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray, she further alleged to police in her home province of Ontario in January 2005. Cosby's attorney in the case, Walter M. Phillips Jr., called the allegations ""utterly preposterous"" and ""plainly bizarre"" at the time, yet in a civil filing, Constand's lawyers said they had found 13 ""Jane Does"" with similar stories. Cosby settled the civil suit in 2006. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but when journalist and publicist Joan Tarshis came forward with another similar story this weekend, Cosby attorney John Schmitt denied her claim and others', labeling them ""decade-old, discredited allegations."" Schmitt later amended that statement to say he wasn't referring to Constand, who resolved her differences ""to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago."" 'I couldn't check her blood' Castor, who was the district attorney for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, when Constand came forward in 2005, now tells CNN he thought Constand was credible, and he thought Cosby was evasive in his interview with prosecutors. Castor, whose assistants interviewed Cosby, said he felt the comedian was setting up a defense that Constand was at his house on her own volition and that anything occurring between them was consensual. ""Back then, the desire on our part to move forward was pretty strong,"" he said. ""The problem with the case was she waited a year until she told police about it."" This left Castor no way to corroborate Constand's allegations, he said. He couldn't check her blood, urine, hair or fingernails for traces of drugs, he couldn't obtain hair or fiber for analysis, and he couldn't obtain a warrant to search Cosby's home for evidence. ""I had a theory that Cosby had drugged the woman using something to make her sleepy and to make her defenseless or unable to recall what happened, but because of the delay, I couldn't check her blood,"" he said. Of Cosby's interview with prosecutors, Castor said, ""I thought he was lying. I thought he was evasive, and I thought that those things would be of value if I had another piece (of evidence) to go forward with."" The case would have come down to she said, he said, and while Castor felt strongly that Constand was telling the truth, her statements alone were not going to be enough to convict Cosby, the ex-prosecutor said. ""Did I think he probably did something inappropriate? Yes. Did I think that I could prove it beyond a reasonable doubt based on available, credible and admissible evidence? No, I didn't,"" he said. Castor released a statement on his office's website in 2005, saying that he found that ""insufficient credible and admissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt."" Constand's attorney filed the civil suit two weeks later. Latest in line of accusations Castor's account comes a day after former supermodel Janice Dickinson became the latest of a handful of women to accuse the 77-year-old comic of sexual assault publicly. She told ""Entertainment Tonight"" that Cosby raped her in 1982 after giving her a pill and a glass of red wine during a dinner in Lake Tahoe. ""The last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain,"" she said. Dickinson did not return a telephone call from CNN seeking comment, but Cosby has repeatedly said previous allegations are untrue. He has never been prosecuted. His attorney, Martin Singer, addressed Dickinson's allegations specifically in a statement, calling them a ""fabricated lie"" and saying they contradicted what she wrote in her autobiography and what she said during a 2002 New York Observer interview. Since 2005, several women have come forward with remarkably similar stories about being drugged and sexually assaulted by the comedian. This year, the accusations resurfaced, and earlier this month, a seemingly harmless post on Cosby's Twitter account turned them into a social media storm. After the accusations gained steam again, one of his accusers, Barbara Bowman, turned to the public once more with an article in The Washington Post and interviews with CNN. Bowman alleged she was drugged, then raped, though she said she never saw drugs. ""I woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes,"" she said. On Saturday, NPR broadcast an awkward interview with Cosby in which he didn't utter a word when repeatedly asked about the accusations. NPR host Scott Simon filled the airtime by saying Cosby was just ""shaking his head no."""

Donald Trump said investors who lost money in a Ponzi scheme were victims of their own greed. Trump recently hosted a party at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago, that was attended by several people who say they were victims of an alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme run by Madoff. Madoff, 70, is a former chairman of Nasdaq. He was charged last week with fraud. Trump, chairman and president of the Trump Organization, a New York-based real estate development empire, spoke with Kiran Chetry on CNN's ""American Morning."" CNN: How angry are people at this situation with Madoff? Donald Trump: ... The people in Palm Beach, many of those people have been just ripped off by this sleazebag, and they'll never see the kind of money that they've seen.  You have some people gave 100 percent of their net worth to him in trust, because they trusted him, they trusted his family, they trusted everybody, and now they literally are selling their houses in order to live. And some of them mortgaged their houses in order to give that money to this Madoff. And it's really a terrible thing. I'd see him around Mar-a-Lago, I'd see him around Palm Beach -- and he's a disgrace.  Watch the possible ramifications of the Madoff case » CNN: ... How did he get away with this? How did so many smart people entrust somebody -- and we keep hearing over and over again, 100 percent of their money going to this guy. Would you ever let 100 percent of your money go to something, even if you trusted the person? Trump: I would not, and a lot of my friends would not, but obviously a lot of my friends did. The word is very simple. It's a word called ""greed."" Greed. That's all it is. People were greedy. They thought he was going to get them a little bit more return, or a lot more return. I mean, he was a Svengali for rich people. There are Svengalis for women; this guy was a Svengali for rich people -- very rich people. But when you think of a person putting up 100 percent of their net worth and even mortgaging their house, even though they had a lot of cash -- mortgaging their house to get more cash to this guy -- and now they're going to have to go out, literally, and maybe work in a drugstore. I don't know what they're going to do. CNN: Did you lose money from Madoff? Trump: No, I did not. CNN: Some are blaming the [Securities and Exchange Commission], saying for years they did not investigate any claims. Chairman Christopher Cox said there were some credible accusations against Madoff made nearly a decade ago that were never referred to the commission to act. So what's your take on the oversight, how the SEC and government handled this? Trump: I would not blame the SEC. This guy was a total crook. The people in his own organization supposedly didn't know about it. Now, that's another thing; I find that hard to believe. He's got two sons, and they didn't know about it? And they worked there for years? I think the whole thing is a swindle. I think even that's a swindle: The father said, ""Look, you guys turn me in and pretend you don't know anything and I'll save my two sons."" But it's impossible for me to believe that his sons didn't know about this. CNN: So you also think it's impossible that he acted alone. Trump: I don't know how you could act alone. They had three floors of a major office building. How could one man be manipulating that much money without all of the people knowing -- without at least a large number of the people knowing about it? So I would certainly think that his sons are guilty."

Nagin allegedly defrauded the city through ""a bribery and kickback scheme"" in which he received checks, cash, wire transfers, personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city, the 25-page federal indictment says. As part of the alleged bribes, Nagin's family members received a vacation in Hawaii; first-class airfare to Jamaica; private jet travel and a limousine for New York City totaling $23,500; and cellular phone service, the indictment said. Nagin's family-owned granite-business Stone Age LLC allegedly benefited in the corruption, too, the indictment said. Nagin could not immediately be reached for comment. According to the indictment, the bribing businessmen allegedly received city contracts of $1 million for consulting, more than $3 million to build a project at Louis Armstrong International Airport, and $1 million for another airport project, the indictment said. Other contracts were for sidewalk repairs in the French Quarter and professional services, authorities allege. Among the conspiracy charges is an accusation that Nagin awarded ""no bid"" work to a city contractor who provided ""concealed and direct campaign monies"" to Nagin, the indictment says. Read the indictment Nagin allegedly received bribes from city contractors in the amounts of $60,000, $2,250, $50,000 and $10,000, the indictment says. He also is accused of receiving a bribe in the form of granite inventory from a city construction contractor. Nagin faces nine counts of honest services wire fraud, alleging he received nine wire transfers amounting to $12,500 each that were bribes or kickback payoffs from the same city construction contractor in 2010 and 2011, the indictment says. Those bribed totaled $112,500. In his 2005 tax return -- the same year that Katrina hit the Gulf Coast -- Nagin allegedly filed a false tax return claiming his income was $156,278, the indictment says. He is also accused of filing false returns for 2006 listing his income at $170,364, for 2007 with an income of $31,163, and for 2008 with a $143,852 income, the indictment said. The indictment does not detail what the government claims the returns should state. In 2005, as Katrina became the single most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history, Nagin took center stage on behalf of victims when he excoriated the slow pace of federal and state relief efforts, even using profanities. Nagin, who is black, urged the reconstruction of a ""chocolate New Orleans,"" adding, ""You can't have New Orleans no other way."" He later apologized, saying everyone is welcome to the city. In issuing a national ""SOS"" during Katrina, Nagin expressed the desperation of a battered Gulf Coast: ""I need reinforcements, I need troops, man. I need 500 buses, man. We ain't talking about -- you know, one of the briefings we had, they were talking about getting public school bus drivers to come down here and bus people out here,"" he told radio station WWL-AM. ""I'm like, 'You got to be kidding me. This is a national disaster. Get every doggone Greyhound bus line in the country and get their asses moving to New Orleans.' In 2010: Nagin -- One day New Orleanians will recognize my good work ""That's -- they're thinking small, man. And this is a major, major, major deal. And I can't emphasize it enough, man. This is crazy,"" Nagin said then. The hurricane slammed the Gulf Coast in 2005 and killed 1,833 people, directly or indirectly, in five states. Damages totaled $108 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Current New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who won election in 2010 when term limits kept Nagin out of the race, said the charges mark ""a sad day for the city of New Orleans."" In the 2006 mayoral race, Nagin beat then Lt. Gov. Landrieu, scion of a prominent Louisiana political family. ""Today's indictment of former Mayor Ray Nagin alleges serious violations of the public's trust,"" Landrieu said in a prepared statement. ""Public corruption cannot and will not be tolerated."" 2010: Nagin remarks on future public office -- 'I have given my pound of flesh' CNN's Zach Cumer and Joe Sutton contributed to this report."

These workers on the Cruceiro Reixo and Cividade Cellar wine estates are harvesting Mencia grapes from precarious slopes near Monforte de Lemos in northwestern Spain. The only way up or down the dizzying canyons is on foot or riding in a tractor, and the grapes themselves are transported in baskets suspended on wire down to the river below. These workers are on the Cruceiro Reixo plots harvesting Mencia grapes some of which will be used in the winemaker's Barrica Cruceiro Reixo red wine The Romans were the first to grow grapes here 2,00 years ago as they marched across Europe, followed by monks The dizzying slopes are so steep that they can only be accessed on foot by grape pickers who undertake the back-breaking work Ramon Fernandez helps to harvest grapes on the slopes of land owned by his relative, Ramon Marcos Fernandez On the banks of the Mino Hector de Leon carries a box of grapes at a Cruceiro Reixo's plot which produces red and white wine They are then taken by boat back to the Adega Cruceiro Winery where they will be juiced and then fermented by Ramon Marcos Fernandez to make Cruceiro wines. The Mencia grapes are a red variety which produce the tradition wine of the region which has been making the alcoholic tipple for 2,000 years. The slopes were originally carved out by the Romans as they marched across Europe. Monks then took over and carved terraces of vines into the slopes of the rivers Sil, Miño and Bibei. These workers on the Cividade Cellar estate in Spain's Riberia Sacra region have to climb up and down the rocky slopes to reach the river which transports the grapes As access to the slopes by vehicles is limited wine makers are forced to improvise, using makeshift pulley systems and boats to move their cargo Jose Ramon (left), is the head winemaker for the Cividade cellar, and is pictured placing boxes of grapes inside a boat in the isolated region Jose and his son Brais are just two producers in a region which now boasts tens of wineries producing thousands of bottles of wine a year Jose Ramon (in red) drives a boat with his daughter, friends and boxes of grapes along the Sil River in the region of Amandi in Ribeira Sacra However, in the 20th century a devastating plague of aphids killed off a lot of the plants before the Spanish civil war rocked the economy, leading to farmers deserting in droves. As a younger generation fled poverty on the slopes for a more prosperous life in the cities, nature moved in to reclaim the land which crumbled into disrepair. As recently as 2009 many of the terraces were abandoned, though producers had started moving back to the region, determined to make it a success once more. As fruit pickers continue their work on the stony banks, a boat speeds away taking grapes back to the Cividade winery for fermentation The Cruceiro winery has won awards from both Spain and Italy since 1990 to recognise the quality of the wine it produces and its latest was given a distinction in 2011 The banks around the river Mino need to have ladders fitted on to them so the labourers can climb up to where the grapes are growing Once the grapes are back at the winery more workers sort through them on a conveyor belt to remove any spoiled or unripe ones before they are juiced Jose Ramon pushes grapes down inside a barrel where they will sit while they ferment to make some of the region's most famous wines Attracted by the indigenous grapes, the slate and granite soils and peculiar microclimates of the rivers and terraces, winemakers are now turning out some award-winning bottles. Dotting the old vineyards are lagares, crumbling stone structures that once provided shelter and a place to ferment grapes right in the vineyard. Every family would have a lagar, to which they would carry the grapes at harvest. Sometimes families would sleep there for the duration of harvest season and they are now being restored to use for storage and a place for vineyard workers to eat a meal away from the grueling heat of the sun. Because of the vallies and rivers of the region it has a unique micro-climate similar to Bordeaux, Champagne and Burgundy In total 13 varieties of grape are grown in the region by more than 100 producers who call the breathtaking countryside home Ramon Marcos Fernandez, the owner of the Adega Cruceiro wine estate enjoys the relative luxury of driving a tractor on the hills which are usually too steep for vehicles The terraces have to be cut into the banks of the three rivers in the region because otherwise they would be impossible to work or plant on Lagares are traditional stone huts built into the hills which are being restored to allow workers a place to relax from the heat or eat lunch with their fellow employees The conditions found in Ribeira Sacra are similar to those found in some of the world's greatest wine regions such as Bordeaux, Champagne and Burgundy. So far this year 3,720 tonnes of Mencia grapes alone have been produced in the whole of the region, along with another 13 varieties being used to make both red and white wines. The term Ribeira Sacra means 'holy river bank' and harks back to a time when the hills were full of monks brewing wine, instead of the intrepid farmers of today. The hills are still littered with a multitude of medieval monasteries, churches and chapels which overlook the rivers or nestle in gentler terrain nearby."

Henry Cuellar has lost patience with President Barack Obama over his response to the surge of minors from Central America crossing the southern border. The Texas lawmaker has criticized the administration's handling of what it has called a ""humanitarian crisis,"" and is urging a reluctant Obama to visit affected areas. He's also unwilling to write Obama a blank check for his $3.7 billion proposal to Congress for addressing the matter. ""We just can't just trust the President and say we are going to give you exactly every penny you want,"" he told CNN in an interview. He also says he hopes Obama's decision to skip a border visit doesn't become his ""Katrina moment,"" a reference to how the heavily criticized federal response to the devastating hurricane and its aftermath was a defining moment in George W. Bush's presidency. Cuellar's sentiment is right in line with Republican critics giving Obama heat over the unexpected influx of minors from Central America, many of them unaccompanied, and now mired in bureaucratic limbo and caught in the middle of a partisan political firefight. But Cuellar's a Democrat who is going after a President of the same party in a high-stakes election year during which immigration has gained prominence as a campaign issue. He told Fox News on Wednesday that he's gotten calls and visits from White House officials but is not giving much thought to that. What's going on? ""I'm more concerned about my constituents,"" Cuellar said, noting the perils facing the tens of thousands of kids coming across the border in record numbers and overwhelming border and immigration services. While the current crisis is taking place in Cuellar's back yard in conservative-led Texas, his crossing of Obama and Democrats is not new for him. He was endorsed by the Conservative Club for Growth during his 2006 primary and backed George W. Bush in the 2000 election that propelled him to the White House. His bruising 2004 primary battle for the House seat then held by Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, who at the time headed the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, won him few friends in the caucus, comprised of Democrats. Cuellar endorsed Hillary Clinton over Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination and even raised money for her campaign. He also was one of 27 Democrats who voted against Wall Street reform legislation backed strongly by Obama early in his presidency. And in 2001, Republican Gov. Rick Perry's appointed Cuellar as Texas secretary of state, a post he held for 10 months. Democrats were unhappy about Cuellar's 2012 support of a redistricting proposal backed by the Perry administration. Critics said he supported the proposal in an effort to ensure a favorable district for himself, a charge he denied. Some Democrats also question Cuellar's latest move: a plan to introduce bipartisan legislation on Thursday with Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn to address the southern border situation. That measure favored by GOP members would reverse a Bush-era law that allows illegal immigrant children from Central American countries to stay in the United States as their cases wend through the backlogged adjudication process. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a staunch immigration reform advocate, said on CNN's ""Crossfire"" on Wednesday ""I wouldn't not support the legislation.""

Onlookers were seeing rubbing their eyes as canisters landed in between their vans and motorbikes on the rocky outcrop, which had afforded the best views of the fighting from a distance. Chased away: Turkey fired tear gas on scores of observers who had gathered on a hillside near the border with the Syrian town Kobane Wiping his eyes: It is not the first time the Turkish military has chased away citizens from the hillside, around a mile from the fighting Staying put: The Rudaw news agency reported journalists retreated but citizens remained on the rocky outcrop as the military arrived According to the Kurdish news agency Rudaw, soldiers in military vehicles ordered the citizens and journalists to retreat to other hills further from Kobane, which had a poorer view of the fighting. While the journalists complied, some of the residents remained and had the gas fired on them in an attempt to make them disperse. A military spokesman told Rudaw the move was to ensure the onlookers' safety, but did not elaborate any further. It is not the first time Turkey has tear-gassed citizens watching the bloody conflict in Kobane. Clashes erupted earlier this month between armed Turkish police and Kurdish refugees as they tried to march back to the border and stage a protest about the conflict. Guards in body-armour and helmets used tear gas to drive a group of around 200 desperate demonstrators back behind Turkish lines. Pinching his nose: The gas firing (pictured) appeared less severe than earlier this month, when Kurdish protesters were forced back Military: Turkish Army vehicles were seen on the hillside as in Kobane, just a mile away, Islamist extremists tried to seize a border gate Leaving: The gas canisters landed between vans and motorbikes, with people reportedly retreating to a hill with a poorer view The scenes came on another day of fierce fighting between Kurdish forces and ISIS extremists, who have been battling to capture the strategic stronghold of Kobane for more than a month. ISIS militants - also called ISIL or Islamic State - tried to seize a post on the border between Kobane and Turkey last night but were repelled once more by Kurdish fighters, who have held them at bay for weeks after the West feared the town would fall. Kurdish official Idris Nassan said the militants shelled a border gate before being pushed back, adding: 'Of course they will try again tonight. Last night they brought new reinforcements, new supplies, and they are pushing hard'. To lose the border gate -- the only official way for the Kurdish fighters in Kobane to cross into Turkey -- would be a major blow to the fighters defending the town as well as the civilians who still remain. Iraqi Kurdish reinforcements are expected to arrive in Kobane but it is not clear how soon. The U.S. launched five fresh air strikes around the town today alongside 12 separate strikes in Iraq. What they could see: The view from the hillside today as Kobane witnessed another round of ISIS attacks and U.S. airstrikes Strike: The U.S. strikes today (pictured) destroyed seven ISIS vehicles and a building used by the terror group, said U.S. officials The U.S. Central Command said the strikes destroyed seven vehicles and one building belonging to the militants near Kobane - while in Iraq, forces concentrated on the area around the strategic Mosul Dam and near Fallujah. Britain, France, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Bahrain have all aided the assault, the U.S. officials added. Today one of the few groups which claims to monitor the situation on the ground in Syria said the death toll in Kobane had reached 851 - including almost 500 ISIS extremists. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, said 302 fighters from the Kurdish YPG group had so killed so far, compared to 481 from ISIS. The Observatory's list also included ten fighters from other groups, 21 civilians, and one volunteer bringing ammunition to the Kurds.

Margaret Thatcher (left) and her daughter Carol Thatcher in   Southampton, England in June 2008 According to reports in the British media, Carol Thatcher referred to a tennis player as a ""golliwog"" back stage during the filming of The One Show last Thursday. The remark was made about a male tennis player taking part in the Australian Open tournament in Melbourne. The term is an offensive word for black people used in several countries. She was immediately challenged about her gaffe but dismissed it as a ""joke."" The BBC said it considered ""any language of a racist nature wholly unacceptable,"" before adding that it had hoped Thatcher, 55, would issue an unconditional apology but she had declined to do so. The remark is thought to have upset a number of people on the show, with one BBC spokesman quoted by The Times newspaper as saying: ""We will no longer be working with Carol Thatcher on The One Show."" However, the corporation said on its Web site that she would not be banned from the BBC as a whole. Thatcher's agent is now demanding an apology from the BBC, the corporation reported Wednesday. Meanwhile, Thatcher's spokesman told The Times Wednesday that she made the remark in a conversation with the show's presenter Adrian Chiles back stage. ""Carol never intended any racist comment,"" he said. ""She made a light aside about this tennis player and his similarity to the golliwog on the jam pot when she was growing up. There's no way, obviously, that she would condone any racist comment -- we would refute that entirely. It would not be in her nature to do anything like that. ""It is disgusting that we've had a leak of private conversations in the green room -- the BBC has more leaks than Thames Water."" The Golliwog first appeared as a character in an 1895 book, ""The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls,"" described by author Florence Kate Upton as ""a horrid sight, the blackest gnome."" Based on a black minstrel doll Upton played with as a child, the character inspired early 20th-Century dolls by several manufacturers and was used as the trademark of James Robertson & Sons, a British jam and preserve maker, in the early 1900s. The term ""wog"" became a widely used racial slur for dark-skinned people that grew in popularity among some Britons during World War II. As late as the 1960s, soldiers in Great Britain's Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders military regiment wore a brooch of one of the Robertson characters for each Arab they killed, according to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan. The term ""golliwog"" is used as racial slur in Germany, England, Ireland, Greece and Australia, according to the museum's Web site. Carol Thatcher, a winner in 2005 of reality television show ""I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!,"" was a regular contributor on the BBC prime-time show."

The daughter of Linda Ann Weston, 51, who previously was arrested in the case, was brought in for questioning Tuesday night and was arrested early Wednesday, said Philadelphia police spokesman Officer Christine O'Brien. The woman, whose name was not given, likely will face the same charges as her mother and two other suspects, which include criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, O'Brien said. More information will be released later Wednesday, she said. No bail had been set. On Tuesday, Philadelphia police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said a woman rescued from the boiler room claims she had two children while being held against her will, and that authorities have located 10 other potential victims. The four people, three men and a woman ranging in age from 29 to 41, were found locked in the room with no food and only a bucket for a toilet, police said. The pitch-black, 15-foot-by-6-foot space houses what police described as a boiler used to heat the building. A penetrating stench of urine and feces still hung in the chamber days after the discovery. One of the four, identified as Derwin McLemire, had been chained to the boiler, police said. While police have not released the names of the four alleged victims, they confirmed the accuracy of media reports identifying them as McLemire, Herbert Knowles, Edwin Sanabria and Tamara Breeden. Weston; Gregory Thomas, 47; and Eddie Wright, 49, were previously arrested. Authorities were investigating whether the victims' Social Security checks had been stolen, as well as several other leads. Six of the 10 new alleged victims are children, Ramsey said. Two of them, ages 2 and 5, are believed to be the children born to Breeden, police said. Authorities did not divulge how Breeden became pregnant. Another is a 19-year-old niece of Weston, Ramsey said. ""The 19-year-old has visible injuries, she may have been beaten, and she has scars all over her body,"" Ramsey said. Breeden said while she was with Weston, ""she says she gave birth to two children and we have no reason to doubt it,"" he said. Weston had identification documents for about 50 people with her when she was arrested, Ramsey said. They included Social Security cards and court documents giving power of attorney, among others. Ramsey said police must track down all of those individuals and find out what happened to them and whether they were victims. It is possible that Weston has been involved in similar activity dating back to the late 1990s, he said. ""We don't know the extent of this,"" Ramsey told CNN Tuesday. ""We do know it goes beyond the borders of Pennsylvania -- at least Texas, Florida and Virginia, and we suspect other locations as well."" Three of the four alleged victims spoke to the media about their harrowing experience on Monday. ""That was real dirty of you. That was wrong,"" a tearful McLemire told CNN affiliate KYW , talking about his alleged captors. The alleged victims said they were beaten and were afraid of the suspects in the case. Breeden told KYW Weston hit her in the head, ""and all this was bleeding and everything."" McLemire, Breeden and a third man, Herbert Knowles, told KYW their Social Security information was taken from them. McLemire, who said he is from North Carolina, said he met Weston on an online dating site, according to KYW. He said once he attempted to escape from a home of Weston's, ""and I didn't get away, so they got me."" Bond for each of the three suspects was set at $2.5 million, according to the Philadelphia district attorney's office. The FBI joined the probe after detectives discovered one of the accused had traveled to at least two other states with the people found in the basement of the northeast Philadelphia apartment building, police spokesman Evers said. Weston served eight years in prison for killing her sister's boyfriend in the early 1980s, Ramsey said earlier. In that case, the victim ""was held captive for an extended period of time, locked in a closet and he literally starved to death,"" he said. ""That concerns us because obviously, she's capable of quite a bit of a lot of different things,"" he said. Asked why Weston is not still behind bars, Ramsey said Tuesday, ""That's a good question. Our legal system is what it is, but you would think that someone who's committed a crime that horrific would still be in jail. But she wasn't, and obviously she wasn't fully rehabilitated, either."" Ramsey said he has a team of detectives working the case, and is likely to put a task force together for long-term investigation, because ""this is not one that's going to end very quickly."" Weston is believed to have been in McLean, Texas, with some or all of the alleged captives. They then traveled to Florida and Philadelphia, Evers said. All seven had been traveling together, he said, but he did not know for how long. A preliminary hearing for the suspects on the charges and evidence in the Philadelphia case was set for October 24. No pleas were entered on Monday, with that to happen at a formal arraignment at a date yet to be set. CNN's Melanie Whitley, Tom Faust, Ross Levitt and Kyra Phillips contributed to this report."

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a heartfelt message of support for the NHS via Twitter. Tens of thousands of people have joined a Twitter group expressing pride in the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which offers free taxpayer-funded medical care to all British residents, while leading politicians have spoken out in support. Republican former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin earlier this week condemned Obama's plans to introduce a public heath insurance scheme as an ""evil"" move that would result in ""death panels"" deciding who would live or die. Her criticism has been echoed by fellow Republicans in direct attacks on Britain's NHS. In an article, Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said British healthcare was run by ""Orwellian"" bureaucrats who put a price tag on life. Sound off: What do you think of the British healthcare model? The comments caused a storm of protest in the United Kingdom, with Prime Minister Brown wading into the argument via micro-blogging site Twitter, where a conversation chain, ""#welovetheNHS"", is generating huge online traffic.  Britons react to the U.S. healthcare debate » A posting on the 10 Downing Street Twitter site on Wednesday read: ""PM: NHS often makes the difference between pain and comfort, despair and hope, life and death. Thanks for always being there."" The message was followed by another, from Brown's wife Sarah, adding: ""#welovetheNHS -- more than words can say."" Professor Stephen Hawking, author of ""A Brief History of Time"", also spoke out in favor of the British system, telling the Guardian newspaper that he owes his life to NHS treatment for the neuro-muscular dystrophy he has suffered from for 40 years. ""I wouldn't be here today if it were not for the NHS,"" he said. ""I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived."" Despite the support, the 51-year-old NHS is regularly the target of criticism at home, with opposition politicians accusing Brown's government of mismanagement resulting in long waiting lists and a ""lottery"" in deciding who gets life-saving drugs and surgery. Nevertheless, opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron also added his voice to the defense campaign with a posting on his party's Web site. "" Millions of people are grateful for the care they have received from the NHS -- including my own family. ""One of the wonderful things about living in this country is that the moment you're injured or fall ill -- no matter who you are, where you are from, or how much money you've got -- you know that the NHS will look after you."" His statement followed comments from one of his own party members backing the Republican criticism of the NHS. Dan Hannan, a Conservative member of the European Parliament reportedly said in an interview that ""he wouldn't wish it on anyone."""

Renee Young and Simon Howie, of Tregear in Sydney's west, say they were shocked when an ultrasound revealed the twins they were expecting were in fact only one child, but with two perfectly symmetrical faces and two brains connected to the one brain stem. Three-dimensional scans show the child has two legs, two arms and one body and all its vital organs, including a strong beating heart. But while doctors told Ms Young she should not keep the child 'because it would be looked upon by the public as a freak', the couple has decided to go through with the birth and 'surround' the child 'with people who love it'. Scroll down for video After getting over the shock of expecting a baby which has two faces and two brains, but a single body, parents of seven, Renee Young and Simon Howie are defying doctor's advice by going through with the birth of the child which they say they shall love even though it will be 'ridiculed' The baby, show here in an ultrasound image of the foetus in utero, is an extreme version of conjoined twin girls which have two faces and two brains joined by a single brain stem, but one body with a single heart Three-dimensional scans show the child has two legs, two arms and one body, but above the neck (as seen on the model, left) the child has two faces on one double-vaulted skull, an exact duplication of eyes, nose and mouth, and two brains (pictured above right on medical imaging) connected to one brain stem Above the neck, the child has one double-vaulted skull and two faces with an exact duplication of eyes, nose and mouth. Ms Young described her unborn child, now 19 weeks old, as 'healthy. The heartbeat's beautiful'. 'The brain activity 's good,' she told the Nine Network's A Current Affair, 'in both brains.' The condition, an extreme form of conjoined twins known as craniofacial hyperhidrosis or diprosopus, is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded. None has survived. Despite the medical unlikelihood of the baby surviving past infancy, the couple has decided to surround her with 'the love' of their large family. The couple, who live on welfare in a public housing block in the Sydney suburb of Tregear, said their strong 'family base'  meant they could protect the child, no matter her deformities. Surrounded by seven children who range in age from teenagers down to the youngest, who is in a high chair, Mr Howie said they had refused to end the pregnancy on 'moral' grounds. 'We thought it was the same as bringing home a child with autism or Down syndrome,' he said, 'I don't really believe in terminating a baby if it's healthy and growing fine.' The Howie family of western Sydney (pictured) plan to embrace the arrival of mother (right) Renee's eighth child, even though the deformities it suffers will make 'schooling, growing up, friends' a challenge Neighbours of Renee Young and Simon Howie and their seven children who live in this four bedroom public housing property (above) in western Sydney may 'ridicule' the family for keeping their conjoined daughter, but they are determined to protect it with their love Teenage sisters of the unborn baby, Angel, Jess and Patsy-Anne (above) don't think their mother should have terminated the child who Patsy-Anne said 'might be deformative, but it's still a baby' which they will love It was early January when the couple made the discovery of their baby's condition during a routine ultrasound which was anything but. During a scheduled appointment, the sonographer told Ms Young 'something was up' and sent her to the couple's GP, who broke the news. The doctor told the couple their baby had 'a conjoinment of the vaults of the skull, which pretty much said there was a conjoined twin,' Mr Howie said. Initially, he was 'shocked, confused, a little bit of everything … I wasn't sure how to take in what he was explaining to me,"" Mr Howie told A Current Affair. Ms Young was too far along in her pregnancy to abort the child. Further tests were made and and a meeting with their obstetrician the couple saw images of their baby's duplication, which occurs only in four per cent of conjoined twins. But the specialist's advice to end the baby's life was met with the couple's firm resolve to 'go through with it'. 'Everything happens for a reason,' Ms Young said. They said they had defied the doctors' urging them not to bring into the world a child that would be regarded as a freak partly because Ms Young had never terminated a pregnancy and because they had a family 'that gives us a lot of support'. 'We've got a really big family, we don't really involve ourselves in the community except for schools where the children are,' Mr Howie said. Maternal foetal specialist Greg Kesby has seen several conjoined twins in his career but none quite like this. Shock and disbelief gave way to acceptance by expectant Renee Young and Simon Howie of Sydney who say 'it will be hard for the community to accept' their next child 'as a normal person' but they felt a moral obligation not to terminate the baby Renee Young did not know anything was wrong until 15 weeks into her pregnancy when a routine ultrasound (above) showed she was carrying a rare form of conjoined twins called diprosopus, of which only 35 cases have been recorded, and none survived Conjoining of twins happens between days 13 and 25 of pregnancy when the embryo fails (above) to split into two separate babies and fusion occurs 'It's probably the rarest of all the conjoined twins, you'd be thinking numbers of one in a million to one in two million for this kind of anomaly,' he said. Dr Kesby said there was a good chance the couple's child would not survive to a live birth but if she did, treatment could prove costly. But the burgeoning family said they would 'cross that bridge as it comes'. 'If we have to go back to work, we will,' said Ms Young who is on a disability pension for her severe rheumatoid arthritis and is looked after by Mr Howie, who draws a carer's pension. The couple's three teenage daughters, Jess, Patsy-Anne and Angel said they did not believe their mother should terminate the pregnancy. 'We'll love it no matter what,' Jess said. 'It might be deformative, but it's still a baby. It's still a human,' said Patsy-Anne. The last known case of diprosopus was the birth of baby girl Lali in 2008 in a remote Indian village. She struggled to feed properly due to her condition and two months to the day she was born, she died. 'If I only get two days with the baby, I only get two days,' Ms Young said. 'That's just the time we actually get to spend with the baby and its brothers and sisters get to meet their little brother or sister.'"

The absences, many of them permanent, are costing the economy more than $12 billion a year in lost productivity and disability benefits and the risks are just as inherent in teachers and lawyers as they are in front-line emergency service workers. But one Australian group aligned with mental health advocacy is helping treat the 1.4 million Australians coping with the disorder - by introducing new workplace programs to combat increased stress levels. Sam Harvey is helping workplaces better cope with the stigma associated with mental health A team of researchers from the Black Dog Institute and UNSW are helping people deal with work-related Workplace Mental Health Researcher Sam Harvey from the Black Dog Institute is teaming up with employers to manage staff stress levels. Firefighters are on the front-line coping with trauma He, along with a team of researchers from the university of NSW, have identified a number of interventions that are effective in reducing significant mental illness for working-age Australians. 'Consider workplace health promotion strategies that include both physical activity incentives and mental health awareness and education,' he said. He said people in occupations with regular exposure to traumatic events, such the police, paramedics, fire fighters, military personnel, medical staff and journalists have historically been associated with post traumatic stress. His team is helping reduce this - by way of  therapy and relaxation training at the place where people spend 'one-half of their waking lives' - at work. Along with in-house workplace counselling and the provision of formal return to work programs for people recovering from mental illness, he said the programs are showing to have an effect in reducing depression. Mr Harvey said employers often do not know how to cope with the issue of mental health in the workplace. 'It is easy for employers to recognise a physical illness, for instance someone who has hurt there leg,' he said. 'They get a get well card and an office on the ground floor.' 'But for someone coming back from depression they (employers and colleagues) don't how to speak to them.' Other experiences such as marital distress, financial strain or dependent children can exacerbate work stress and result in strain, illness and sickness absence. In addition, other issues such as substance misuse, poor diet and limited exercise may be directly or indirectly related to either the organisation culture or personal choices. Write caption here The Black Dog Institute is a world leader in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. Emergency Service personnel area the highest risk of suffering mental health issues But despite how bad the workplace might be, Mr Harvey said the impact of unemployment on mental health is much worse. During the Global Financial Crisis, Dr Harvey said the rate of suicide in America and Europe was inflated quite dramatically as a result of job losses and financial insecurity. Some 5000 additional suicides were committed by people across America and Europe in 2008 - the year the GFC hit. In Australia, the problem was less severe. In Australia issues such as 'downsizing corporations,' highlighted most recently by the closure of Holden's Australian arm, are adding to mental health stress on working-aged Australians. In the northern suburbs of Adelaide, at the company's Elizabeth plant, the rate of youth unemployment is already at 44 per cent and the city as a whole experienced 209 deaths by suicide in 2011 - the ABS reported. He said the risk of suicide is greater if people have been dismissed from their job - without finding another in a 12 month period. 'Involuntary job loss also increases the risk of suicide and attempted suicide,' he said. Adding that while front-line emergency service workers such as doctors and nurses are among the biggest risk groups, those employed in other 'highly demanding jobs' where there is a mismatch between effort and reward are also not immune. 'This is highly prevalent in teachers and lawyers and elements of the public sector.'"

In an unprecedented attack by a former prime minister on a leading business, Mr Brown claimed Rupert Murdoch’s media group has ‘links with the criminal underworld’ and accused it of using ‘disgusting’ methods to gain access to personal information. He said he and wife Sarah had been left ‘in tears’ when Rebekah Brooks, then editor of The Sun, contacted them to tell them she was going to publish a story about his son Fraser’s diagnosis with cystic fibrosis. War of words: Gordon Brown is locked in a battle with News International after an unprecedented attack on the company in a television interview However, The Sun last night claimed that there had been no wrong-doing and that the story came to them through a good old-fashioned method - a tip-off from a member of the public. Mr Brown also claimed his bank accounts and legal files had been accessed by investigators working for the Sunday Times. The former Prime Minister said: ‘News International were using people who were known criminals,’ he said. ‘People who had in some cases criminal records, and... News International as a result were working through links that they had with the criminal underworld.’ But News International hit back last night, categorically denying allegations that The Sun had accessed medical records. It also claimed Mr Brown and his wife Sarah gave senior staff at the paper consent to publish the November 2006 article. A spokesman for the firm said: ‘We are able to assure the Brown family that we did not access the medical records of their son, nor did we commission anyone to do so. News Corporation Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch photographed with his wife Wendi and Prime Minister Gordon Brown and wife Sarah - just months after the story about the Browns' son Fraser's condition was printed in The Sun 'On receipt of the information, The Sun approached Mr Brown and discussed with his colleagues how best to present it. 'Those colleagues provided quotes which were used in the published piece which indicated his consent to it. 'We continue to inquire into other allegations made by Mr Brown.' In an article published today in The Sun, the unnamed member of the public said he contacted reporters with information about Fraser's cystic fibrosis in an attempt to raise awareness about the condition. He said: 'I felt vindicated in contacting The Sun. I just felt at the time that we could have made something positive out of the tragedy and I believe the truth would have come out eventually anyway. Cosying up with the Murdochs: Brown shakes Elisabeth's hand inside No 10 in March 2008. Rebekah Brooks, right, who was then editor of The Sun watches on 'It is tragic for the Browns like many other people throughout the years who have children diagnosed. But the fact that they are so high profile could have made a difference.' The father, who is said to have links with the Brown family, learned about Fraser's condition just weeks after he was born, the paper said. However, he did not immediately pass on the news because he expected it to be widely reported. 'I was very surprised it didn't come out before it did,"" he added. 'I did it with the best of intentions and I totally stand by that decision. 'I have no regrets. I just wanted to highlight this. It's happened to many people and it's just sad that it's happening to another family. A very high profile family.' The source also said he did not have access to the Brown family medical records. 'I have not had access to the medical records of the child at any time,' he said. The Sunday Times also denied Mr Brown’s claims, insisting it had investigated a story about his purchase of a flat, which it published in January 2000, in the public interest. ‘We were told that Mr Brown had bought a flat cheaper than any normal valuation and that he obtained it through a company in which Geoffrey Robinson, a close ally, had been a director,’ the newspaper said in a statement. A convicted conman, Barry Beardall, is said to have been commissioned by the paper to ‘blag’ information on the apartment. But the statement said: ‘We had reasonable grounds to investigate this matter and followed the PCC Code on using subterfuge. ‘We believe no law was broken in the process of this investigation, and contrary to Mr Brown’s assertion, no criminal was used.’"

These new records, obtained by USA Today yesterday, provide a first public view of just how frequently the agency employs criminals to help with their inquiries. Yet this figure is just the tip of the iceberg. The FBI's set of sources represents a small fraction of the huge amount of informers used by state and local government every year. No data is available on other federal authorities such as the DEA. Nerve center: The J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington DC is headquarters for the FBI, and its network of informants Vital: Joseph 'The Ear' Massino was the first official Mafia boss to cooperate with federal authorities in 2004. The Bonanno crime family boss agreed to wear a wire during conversations with his successor and implicated many of his former associates 'The million-dollar question is: How much crime is the government tolerating from its informants?' Alexandra Natapoff, a professor at Loyola Law School Los Angeles told USA Today. 'I'm sure that if we really knew that number, we would all be shocked,' she added. This 2011 report, acquired by USA Today under the Freedom of Information Act, has been heavily redacted by the authorities. As such, the document doesn't explain the type or severity of the crimes committed by agency informers, or how many incidents involved the sources without permission of the FBI. The FBI has been required to submit these details to the Justice Department for over a decade, after the agency allowed James 'Whitey' Bulger to run a crime ring in exchange for information. The agency has defended its actions in the past, saying that allowing its informers - who are often criminals - to commit offences is a necessary evil. Law change: The FBI has been required to submit informer details to the Justice Department since the agency allowed James 'Whitey' Bulger (pictured center as his trial in July 2013) to run a crime ring in exchange for information. 'It sounds like a lot, but you have to keep it in context,' said Shawn Henry, who worked on FBI criminal investigations until he retired in 2012. 'This is not done in a vacuum. It's not done randomly. It's not taken lightly,' he continued. An FBI spokeswoman declined to give more details. But USA Today reported that the agency had around 15,000 confidential sources in 2007. There are strict rules, enforced by the Justice Department, on what FBI informers are allowed to do. Violent crime for example cannot be authorized by agents and must have federal approval first. Yet a 2005 inspection concluded that the agency often broke these restrictions, as reported by USA Today. 'This is all being operated clandestinely. Congress doesn't even have the information,' Democrat Congressman Stephen Lynch told the paper. Betrayal? In 2013, the FBI released documents that confirmed that noted photographer Ernest Withers served as a paid informant from 1958 to 1972. Withers reported on the activity of several Civil Rights leaders, including Martin Luther King, Jr Lynch has also sponsored legislation that would make federal authorities report serious crimes committed by their informers. 'I think there's a problem here, and we should have full disclosure to Congress,' he added."

Anthony Williams wants his daughter Maria, who suffers from Down's syndrome, to continue studying at Columbus College, Chelmsford, until she is 25. But Essex County Council say she was no longer entitled to publicly-funded education once she reached the age of 19. Appeal hearing: The Royal Courts of Justice in London where Anthony Williams is fighting a legal battle to keep his disabled daughter in school The battle has been taken to the Court of Appeal where senior judges will decide on the woman's future. It is seen as a vital test case which could see thousands of adults with learning difficulties continuing into state-funded education and sharing classrooms with children, costing local councils millions. The court heard that Miss Williams, who is from Chelmsford, entered mainstream education when she was five but was always one year behind her peers and was transferred to the specialist Columbus College in 2006. She has a reading age of nine, cannot tell the time and has no concept of money, but she loves drama, dance and the expressive arts. She continues to study at the college, which, with the approval of her father, is happy for her to stay on until she is 25, the court heard. But, since 2008, the council has insisted her Statement of Special Education Needs only ran until she was 19, after which she would not be entitled to publicly-funded education. Following a long-running legal wrangle with her father, the council has now brought the case before the Court of Appeal, asking three senior judges to rule on the issue. Decision to make: Lord Justice Maurice Kay is one of the Court of Appeal judges who will make a decision on Maria Williams' future in education David Wolfe, for Mr Williams, told the court a 'flexible approach' should be taken, which would prevent those who need continuing education 'falling off a cliff when they hit 19'. He said: 'Although a statement can only be made in the first place for someone who is at the time ""a child"", statements do not automatically lapse, for example simply because the person ceases to be ""a child"".' Fiona Scolding, for the council, warned judges that allowing students with special educational needs to continue in schools past 19 would have a massive impact on local authorities around the country. She said: 'There are approximately 223,000 children and young people in  England and Wales with statements of special educational needs. 'This case is about Maria Williams and its facts, but it is applicable to the other young people approaching or having reached 19, who may well wish to stay in school until their late twenties.' 'It is a point of real importance, as it raises a significant issue of principle as to when a local authority's responsibility ceases for those with statements of special educational needs. 'Local authorities have, to date, considered that their responsibilities end, in line with the code of practice, the year that a child becomes 19.'This also raises questions about the designation of schools and how they would manage to accommodate these individuals, and also practical questions about safeguarding younger children if there are a cohort of adults being taught with them.' Recognising the widespread importance of the case, Lord Justice Maurice Kay, sitting with Lord Justice Moses and Mrs Justice Baron, reserved their judgement, which will be given at an unspecified date in the future."

And he was provided with further confidence that his Derby side have what it takes for promotion with the kind of convincing display that has been expected of them during his 14-month tenure. Alex Mowatt’s own goal before the break and a Jake Buxton header shortly after half-time ensured Leeds were never in this contest. It was a night for Derby fans to savour as they enjoyed a seventh straight home win over their old rivals in front of a season’s best crowd of 31,690, even more than watched the recent defeat to Chelsea.

Leeds had beaten Derby 2-0 at Elland Road earlier this year but their evening got off to a bad start as left back Stephen Warnock injured himself tackling Cyrus Christie and he was replaced by Gaetano Berardi with just eight minutes on the clock. Derby had the better of the play but this game lacked much in the way of clearcut chances early on with Souleymane Doukara seeing an effort blocked for the visitors while at the other end Will Hughes was also denied by a firm Leeds defence. On-loan Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe was not punished despite going down easily in the area while Tommaso Bianchi curled wide from distance and Mirco Antenucci went close for Leeds. But they went on to concede in calamitous fashion on 40 minutes. Hughes burst down the left and his low, teasing cross struck Cooper and then hit Mowatt before beating Marco Silvestri via the crossbar. It was the second game running that Leeds had conceded an own goal. Hughes celebrates after seeing his cross result in a Mowatt own goal in the 41st minute Jake Buxton steers his second half header towards the Leeds goal to put his side into a 2-0 lead Buxton is mobbed by his Derby team-mates after putting his side into a commanding lead And up until that point they had been more than in the game. Derby were buoyed by the goal and could have extended their lead before the break. Captain Richard Keogh’s header from Jeff Hendrick’s free kick was well saved by Silvestri before Ibe shot wide from the edge of the area. The game was as good as up for Leeds at the start of the second half though. Buxton strained to reach a Hendrick 47th-minute free kick but got his head well to the ball to leave Silvestri well beaten. It was his first goal since November 2013 but he still received more red cards this season – two – than he has found the net. Things looked like they would get even worse for Leeds with confidence visibly draining out of them. Ibe went close to Derby’s third as his long ranger was pushed away by Silvestri. Chances kept coming for Derby as Leeds wilted despite their fanatical support and Ibe headed wide from another pinpoint Christie cross but the fact it was not total humiliation will at least give Leeds’ fanatical supporters something to cheer.

In preparation for the release of his new book detailing his months spent in hiding in 1989, British Indian novelist Rushdie wrote an article for The New Yorker telling how he feared that he would have to sacrifice himself in order to save his son. The journey begins after the release of his book The Satanic Verses in February 1989, when Rushdie went into protective custody after Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini went on the national radio and issued a fatwa, or religious order for Muslims, condoning his assassination and offering a bounty for his head. Though the threat started in Iran - far from Rushie's home in London - it carried great weight as the author's book was considered blasphemous by many Muslims throughout the globe. The threat was thought to be so credible that the British police deemed it Level 2, meaning he came after the Queen in the pecking order of possible targets. Shortly after being assigned a constant security detail - which included volunteer officers because the risk attached to the duty of guarding him was so great that the police could not order officers to take on the assignment - Rushdie and his then-wife fled London in hopes of steering clear of angry mobs. Before doing so, he visited his first wife Clarissa Laurd and their young son Zafar. They made a plan that they would check in every night at 7pm on the dot to make sure that both parties were alright. Angry protests: On February 14, 1989, the Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini said on the national radio that a religious law- a fatwa- now existed against Rushdie because his book slandered the prophet Muhammed The plan was to have Rushdie call Laurd's home phone, and if they knew they were not going to be there at the time, they would leave a message on Rushdie's machine in London. It worked perfectly for months and gave Rushdie the assurance that he needed while hiding out in the countryside. Fear: The British police deemed the degree of threats against Rushdie as Level 2, second only to the Queen A month into his life of hiding, Rushdie called as per usual but had no response from Laurd and had no message on his machine. An hour went by, and Rushdie was in true panic mode. He had his security detail arrange for a London squadron go check on the house to see if it looked like there had been an attack. His fears were realized when the police reported that all of the lights were on in the home and the front door was open. Rushdie sat with his face dripping wet with tears as he ran through options where an angry mob had killed his ex-wife during a struggle but held on to his young son in an effort to negotiate a ransom for Rushdie's head. 'You understand, that if they have him and they want a ransom, they want me to exchange myself for him, then I’m going to do that, and you guys can’t stop me doing it,' Rushdie told his body man, Stan. 'That thing about exchanging hostages, that only happens in the movies. In real life, I’m sorry to tell you, if this is a hostile intervention they are both probably dead already. The question you have to ask yourself is, Do you want to die as well?' Stan replied. The minutes of tense waiting were punctuated only by the sound of Rushdie dialling and redialling the home number of his ex-wife. Then and now: Though the fatwa has never been officially retracted, Rushdie no longer lives in hiding Finally, he heard his young son's voice pick up and explain that they had been at a school drama event that ran overtime. All was fine but Rushdie's calm had not returned as he feared that intruders were hiding inside the house since police had seen that the door was ajar before Laurd and Zafar got home. 'It would seem, that there has been a regrettable error. The car we sent to have a look looked at the wrong house,' Stan said. The phone schedule and the many other ways in which his life changed following the fatwa are the basis for the author's latest book, entitled Joseph Anton as an homage to his alternate identity used while he was under protection, which is released next week."

But the stiff upper lip could be a thing of the past, it was claimed yesterday. The ability of the English to remain stoical and visibly unmoved under pressure has been replaced by a tendency to show off our emotions in public. The outpouring of emotion over the death of Princess Diana and watching footballers such as David Beckham and Paul Gascoigne cry on the pitch has given us licence to display our emotions for all to see, a survey suggested. The research, commissioned by the think tank British Future, asked 2,360 people which qualities summed up the concept of being English, and which were outdated. Fifty-one per cent of those questioned think the stiff upper lip is an ‘outdated stereotype’, while other familiar characteristics - a fondness for queuing, apologising and talking about the weather - are all still well ingrained into the English mind set. Seventy per cent of those polled said the English sense of humour as a national attribute, while the vast majority chose talking about the weather as the most quintessentially English trait. Sixty-nine per cent said the English were happy to queue and wait their turn, and 60 per cent described ‘saying sorry unnecessarily’ was a national trait. British Future, which deals with ‘identity and integration’, commissioned the ICM poll ahead of a Festival of Englishness, which it will co-host with another think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, in London this weekend. Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, said: ‘From Gazza’s tears to the public reaction to Princess Diana’s death... people are more happy to wear their heart on their sleeves. 'The Englishness that we’ve now got is still proud of tradition, such as Shakespeare, but isn’t as emotionally repressed and buttoned up as it was in the past.’ More than half of those surveyed said that being happy to wait in a queue was an English trait He continued: ‘This research shows that many of the images of what sums up being English still ring true for most people - that we talk about the weather, are happy to queue and are proud of our distinctive sense of humour, but do say sorry too much. ‘But the English also feel that we have become less buttoned up. ‘After the chilly, stiff upper lip world of Downton Abbey and Brief Encounter, this research shows that we don’t see being emotionally repressed as a valuable part of our national character.’ Mr Kutwala added: ‘We hope to put to bed the equally outdated idea that Englishness is something we can’t really talk about. 'There is much to be proud of in English history and culture, comedy and sport. We need to ditch the idea that Englishness is the one national identity that nobody’s allowed to celebrate.’ The ICM poll, which took the thoughts of more than 2,300 people, also revealed the most popular choices for the best ‘spokesman for England’. Top of the list - which excluded politicians - was the Queen, who was in the top three choice for 57 per cent of respondents. Next was the actor and comedian Stephen Fry with 27 per cent, while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, was picked by 12 per cent."

Sol and Christine Moghadam from Irvine, California, traveled to Ghana with their two biological children to adopt four siblings there. They adopted the children on June 14, but officials in the nation questioned the legality of their adoption, leading to their detention over the weekend, according to Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the State Department. ""Ghana was concerned that some of the documents they had weren't filled out properly or were forged,"" said Hank Fortener, founder of AdoptTogether, an advocacy group that provides a platform for prospective parents to raise funds. The couple used the group's website to raise funds. African adoption should be discouraged 'at all costs,' group says Though they are still in the nation, Ghanaian officials have since determined their documents are legitimate, according to Fortener. A bond has been posted for their release and they were reunited with their biological children Monday, Nuland said this week. ""We are emotionally exhausted and traumatized from the entire incident but we are thankful to have support and prayers from friends and family worldwide,"" the Moghadams said on their blog, Our adoption journey to Africa.

"" CNN's repeated attempts to reach the couple and Ghanaian officials were unsuccessful. The Moghadams initially planned to adopt a child in Ethiopia in 2010, but decided on Ghana after they saw the four siblings on the waiting list of an adoption agency. Africa has seen a surge of adoptions in the past eight years, according to adoption expert Peter Selman from Newcastle University in Britain. A new report from The African Child Policy Forum entitled ""Africa: The New Frontier for Intercountry Adoption"" says prospective adoptive parents are turning ""en masse"" to the continent as other countries toughen their laws. Most children adopted from Africa go to the United States or France, two of the world's biggest receiving countries, Selman said. Stolen babies scandal haunts Spain"

At least, they believed they did. When anthropologists dug up his coffin Tuesday they found no body, only wooden boards, reports CNN. A team of University of South Florida anthropologists has worked to exhume and identify the bodies of students buried at Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, where 100 students died between 1900 and 1952. Discovery: Erin Kimmerle has lead a team of researchers and students from University of South Florida and dug up Curry's casket, but found only planks of wood (photos from University of South Florida) As the school's campus was becoming a series of graveyards, Curry died 'under suspicious circumstances while escaping Dozier twenty-nine days after arriving,' according to court documents. The coroner at the time told the family there was no known cause of death, though a ledger noted he was 'killed on RR Bridge Chattahoochee, Fla.' The cemetery where he was buried has a document simply saying he was 'killed by train.' Then in 2008 a death certificate was turned up at Dozier during a state investigation saying that Curry died of a crushed skull but the cause was 'unknown.' That led  anthropologist Erin Kimmerle up to Old Cathedral Cemetery in Philadelphia, where she hoped to answer questions of one more student's death. The casket they found had the same thumbscrews as coffins found on Dozier's campus, but when they opened it, all they found was wood. 'Layers of pieces of wood,' says Kimmerle. 'It was completely filled with wooden planks.' Crosses: The campus at the school became a series of graveyards, as officials buried scores of boys who had died while attending, sending others like Curry home to families Exhumed: Anthropologists from the University of South Florida, led by Erin Kimmerle, have worked to identify grave shafts and exhume bodies Plots: The arrangement of graves on the grounds is at times orderly and other times haphazard, and Kimmerle believes more graves are yet to be discovered Forensics: University students assisted in the digs, which are intended to find human remains and investigate if possible the causes of death 'Where is he?' said a shocked Pennsylvania state police corporal Thomas McAndrew at the graveside. The Dozier school, which only closed in 2011, has been described as a veritable hell of violence and torture, with with one staff member describing 'boy hunting' to the Tampa Bay Times, where armed guards or convicts from the nearby prison known as 'dog boys' tracked down escapees. Back at Dozier, surviving charges say they were lashed, and some alleged they were sexually abused and raped, though some former administrators have denied the abuse. That is where Curry fled from just before he was found lying by the train tracks with a fatal head wound, and someone worked to ensure the body was not discovered. 'Something was shipped up from Florida, and it was buried, and someone believed it was Thomas Curry,' Kimmerle said later. When the school sent the coffin to his grandmother back in 1925, no one apparently checked the contents inside before a Catholic ceremony was held and he was buried. Kimmerle has contacted relatives of Curry's, and one cousin, 61-year-old Eileen Witmier, who is the granddaughter of Curry's mom's sister, has provided DNA samples researchers hope match to use to identify Curry if his body is found.

Arias, a former waitress from California, was found guilty last month of killing Travis Alexander, whose body was found slumped in the shower of his Phoenix-area home in June 2008. He had been stabbed 27 times, had his throat slashed and was shot in the face. Prosecutors have revealed they will still pursue a death penalty for Jodi Arias, pictured here before the jury's non-decision in her sentencing was handed down Arias says the killing was self-defense, and that on the day of Alexander's death, he attacked her and she was forced to fight for her life. However, no other evidence - other than Arias' accounts - has been presented at trial showing Alexander had ever been physically violent. Authorities say Arias planned the attack. She initially denied involvement then blamed it on masked intruders. Two years after her arrest, she said it was self-defense. Following the deadlock, the jury foreman claimed he is has been threatened with hate mail, with strangers saying they will kill him for failing to sentence Arias to death. 'Today I read hate mail my dad had gotten,' the son of foreman William Zervakos wrote on his blog. 'Some person had sent him a threatening message complete with his email address, full name, and phone number (which at the very least means that this guy should retake Hate Mail 101).' Heartbroken: Travis Alexander's relatives, including his sister Tanisha (right) were a constant presence at the trial and they were moved to tears when they heard that it would drag on for more months The state of Arizona now has the option of retrying the sentencing phase of the trial, which would require a new jury be empanelled, NBCNews.com reported. If there is another deadlock, a judge would sentence Arias to natural life in prison, or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery told reporters prosecutors would ask a new sentencing jury to do what the previous one could not - put Arias to death. 'At this point, we are still preparing to move forward to retry the penalty phase,' Montgomery told a news conference. New target: William 'Bill' Zervakos has received death threats in the wake of the Jodi Arias trail where he and the other jury members failed to punish her with the death penalty Mr Zervakos has previously explained that the jury aced a decision that was wrenching and real, with implications that could haunt them forever. He said the jury struggled with one specific question in their private deliberations: How heinous of a killing deserves a similar fate? 'The system we think is flawed in that sense because this was not a case of a Jeffrey Dahmer or Charles Manson,' Zervakos told The Associated Press. 'It was a brutal no-win situation. ... I think that's kind of unfair,' the 69-year-old added. 'We're not lawyers. We can't interpret the law. We're mere mortals. And I will tell you I've never felt more mere as a mortal than I felt for the last five months.' Zervakos said the most difficult time of the entire trial was hearing directly from victim's family as his brother and sister tearfully explained how his killing has shattered their lives. 'There was no sound in that jury room for a long time after that because you hurt so bad for these people,' he said. 'But that wasn't evidence. That's what made it so hard.... This wasn't about them. This was a decision whether we're going to tell somebody they were going to be put to death or spend the rest of their life in prison.' Zervakos described a deliberations room full of tears and spinning moral compasses as each juror struggled to come to grips with their own beliefs about what factors - including Arias' young age at the time of the killing and her lack of criminal history - should cause them to show mercy and spare her life. 'You've got Travis Alexander's family devastated, that he was killed, that he was brutally killed. You've got Jodi Arias' family sitting in there, both families sitting and seeing these humiliating images and listening to unbelievably lurid private details of their lives, and you've got a woman whose life is over, too,' Zervakos said. 'I mean, who's winning in this situation? And we were stuck in the middle.' Zervakos declined to discuss his thoughts or those of other jurors on whether Arias should have been sentenced to death or life. But he said he was torn between her two personas: a killer and an average young woman struggling through life. 'You heard (prosecutor Juan) Martinez say she was only 27.... She's old enough that she should have known better,' Zervakos said. 'I didn't look at it that way. I'm looking at 27 years of an absolutely normal everyday young woman that was living a life that was perfectly normal. 'Then something changed the trajectory of her life after meeting Travis Alexander, and it spiraled downhill from there.'"

PC Warren Luke grabbed the woman as she clutched the arm of her seriously ill seven-year-old daughter. Nurses watched in horror as he punched the mother in the face and kicked her, it was alleged. The ferocity of the clash left the girl, who suffers from cerebral palsy, covered in her mother's blood. The 41-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wept yesterday as she told jurors she had feared she would die. She said Luke attacked her in full view of a ward of very sick children, leaving her bleeding heavily from a wound to her face. 'I couldn't do anything. I was being beaten. I was helpless. He kicked me six or seven times,' she said. In a police video interview played to the jury, she described how Luke suddenly turned on her as two women PCs spoke to her 'nicely'. 'He told me, 'You've got to leave, you've got to leave',' she said. 'I kept playing with my daughter and then I saw him moving towards me. He was kicking me and kicking me. 'He had one hand on my head. When I fell on the bed he grabbed my hair and banged my head. I was screaming. 'I couldn't defend myself. My ex-husband ran in and shouted, 'Why are you kicking my wife?' 'It seemed as if this officer wanted to kill me.' The former husband said: 'I saw him punch her in the face. He was elbowing her too.' Luke, 38, was one of four officers called to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in December 2013 after the woman argued with doctors and refused to leave her daughter's bedside. Nurses feared the woman would try to remove the girl from the hospital, where she had spent two months receiving life-saving care. Prosecutor Samantha Cohen told Wood Green Crown Court in North London that Luke made the woman release her daughter's arm, but returned moments later and grabbed her hair. Luke was accused of savagely beating a mother who rowed with staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (pictured) Luke, a Met officer for six years, denied the attack during the trial at Wood Green Crown Court (pictured) She said: 'He then punched her in the back of her head and on her back. He then kicked her arm a number of times. She was bleeding heavily from her face. She offered no resistance.' The woman was handcuffed by two other officers and escorted from the hospital. Security staff told police they were appalled by Luke's behaviour, Miss Cohen said. Two of his colleagues reported Luke to a supervising officer and he was arrested later that evening. Susannah Stevens, for Luke, said he behaved 'calmly and politely' and accused the woman of 'completely exaggerating' the force used. The woman had behaved aggressively towards staff twice before and had grabbed Luke's groin during the melee, she said. Luke, a Met officer for six years, denies causing bodily harm. The trial, which is expected to last up to three weeks, continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."
275825,dailymail-train-32c49cf0b87e95daa8cc624e1e1ca7457992ee91,But what if I can apply apply one product instead instead of five?,SUPPORTS,"[215, 226]",1.0,,,,cnndm/dailymail/stories/32c49cf0b87e95daa8cc624e1e1ca7457992ee91.story,"Ask any woman to tip out the contents of her make-up bag and you’re likely to be met with a guilty grimace. A survey revealed that the average British woman requires 55 minutes to get ready each morning — and that doesn’t include showering. If skincare is included, 11 per cent of us slap an extraordinary 40-plus products on to our faces every day. I have always considered myself fairly low-maintenance — yet when I turn out my make-up bag, I am shocked to discover I regularly use a whopping 16 different products, from BB (blemish balm) cream to concealer to eyeshadow. Scroll down for video Sarah Chalmers models a more made up look (left) and one using just three cosmetic items (right) The contents of my battered bag add up to £289 and applying them all takes me 25 minutes. But in an age of multi-tasking, why can’t a lipstick double up as a blusher, or a foundation work as a concealer? As a working mother-of-three, finding the time for my entire beauty routine can be a luxury. But what if I could apply one product instead of five? With this in mind, I swapped my usual 16 products for just three, multi-function items. Here’s how I got on . . . THE SUPER FOUNDATION Max Factor Face Finity All Day Flawless 3 in 1 Foundation WHAT: Max Factor Face Finity All Day Flawless 3 in 1 Foundation, £12.99 for 30ml THE CLAIM: This ‘holds like a primer, corrects like a concealer, with the long-lasting finish of a liquid foundation with SPF 20’. REPLACES: BB cream, primer, foundation, concealer and translucent powder, which cost £110. APPLICATION: I brushed the foundation to my face, then blended. I applied more around the dark shadows of the eye area as I would a concealer. This took all of one minute, whereas my usual five products take me nearer ten. The effect was fine until after lunchtime when this multi-function make-up needed topping up. EXPERT OPINION: Celebrity make-up artist Oonagh Connor, who has tended the faces of Marie Helvin and Fiona Bruce among others, says: ‘I didn’t think this blended well. It’s also effective to have a separate concealer.’ VERDICT: The 3 in 1 is certainly cheap, fast to apply and lightweight to carry. But it didn’t hold well on my skin, all but sliding off. A handy standby for when I’m on-the-run, but I won’t be swapping my five trusty regulars for this. 4/10 CHEEKS AND LIPS WHAT: Nudestix Lip and Cheek pencil, £24 (includes sharpener) THE CLAIM: ‘An extra-creamy soft-feeling lip-liner, lip colour and cheek cream all in one’, promising colour, cover and ‘blendability’. Nudestix Lip and Cheek pencil REPLACES: Lip-liner, lipstick and gloss, blusher and highlighter, which cost £78. APPLICATION: I applied pencil around my lip line, then filled in over the lips themselves. I thought the sensation of using a pencil rather than a velvety lipstick would be odd, but it felt remarkably smooth. And when I simply drew a pencil-line on my cheeks, I was sure it would be obvious even after blending, but the effect was natural. EXPERT OPINION: Oonagh says: ‘This gives a lovely, dewy, natural look. On the lips, the creamy texture of the Nudestix lets you dab your finger to apply it like a tint, if you don’t want to pencil it on. It’s so easy to blend, it works almost like a highlighter, and I like the look of wearing the same colour on your lips and cheeks.’ VERDICT: Normally I would use different shades for lips and cheeks, but I loved this and would use it again. Even the tin box it comes in looks classy. 10/10 EYE AREA THE PRODUCT: Giorgio Armani Eye and Brow Maestro, £26.50, applicator, £20 Giorgio Armani Eye and Brow Maestro THE CLAIM: ‘A waterproof cream that features a dual transformation texture. The solid cream becomes liquid on application then sets on the skin for lasting hold.’ REPLACES: Two separate eyeliners, eyeshadow, brow pencil, brow fixer gel and mascara, worth £100. APPLICATION: Using a specially designed applicator — a brush at one end to shape the brows, and an angled flat brush at the other to apply liner or colour to the lid — I painted on a flicked line on top of my lashes, some shading underneath the eye, and blended colour on the lid. Using the eyebrow brush end, I put more colour on my brows. You can even brush a little on your lashes as a mascara. It took barely two minutes compared to the normal 11. Nothing smudged and it stayed on all day. EXPERT OPINION: Oonagh says: ‘I quite often use eyeshadow to colour brows. But I do think a lot of us would miss mascara.’ VERDICT: With nine shades to choose from, a tiny compact and a clever brush, this product is a multi-tasker. 9/10 CAN 16 BECOME THREE? With the price of my make-up regime slashed by £204.50 (from £288 to £83.50), and the time needed reduced from 25 minutes to a scant five, the three wonder products are impressive, despite having to touch up the 3-in-1 foundation part way through the day. With more practice, I could achieve everything I get from my normal routine. But for a special occasion, I would stick with my carefully chosen, separate products."

Buzzfeed claims that Josh Mohrer, Uber's New York general manager, tracked technology reporter Johana Bhuiyan on two occasions using a feature known as 'God View'. God View is available to all employees at the car-sharing service and allows them to see customer activity, such as where a person wants to be picked up. Scroll down for video Tracked: Buzzfeed claims that Josh Mohrer (left), Uber's New York general manager, tracked technology reporter Johana Bhuiyan on using a feature known as 'God View'. Pictured right is the Uber app The allegation, which Buzzfeed claims came from two former Uber employees, follows a meeting in November at Uber's New York headquarters. According to the news site, when Ms Bhuiyan arrived at the meeting, Mr Mohrer said: 'There you are…I was tracking you.' However, Ms Bhuiyan had never granted permission for Mr Mohrer  to follow her using the tool. Two months earlier, Ms Bhuiyan had asked about  competitor Lyft, and Mr Mohrer had emailed her logs of some of her Uber trips. While Uber would not comment on the allegation, it is understood that the company is now investigating Mr Mohrer. Shocking: Emil Michael (pictured), Uber's senior vice president, reportedly proposed looking into journalists' 'personal lives' and 'families' while in the presence of a BuzzFeed editor at a private dinner in  New York 'Our data privacy policy applies to all employees: access to and use of data is permitted only for legitimate business purposes,' a spokesperson for Uber told MailOnline. 'Data security specialists monitor and audit that access on an ongoing basis. Violations of this policy do result in disciplinary action, including the possibility of termination and legal action.' The news follows another incident this week in which a senior executive at Uber made a grovelling apology after suggesting putting a team together to dig up dirt on journalists who criticise his company. Emil Michael, who made the remarks at a private dinner in Manhattan, said he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them. Target: He was speaking with specific reference to Sarah Lacy (left), editor of PandoDaily, who recently wrote about deleting her Uber app after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in France The scheme was targeted at a particular Silicon Valley female editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - but drew an outraged backlash when it became public. A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely. Mr Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologise to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them. 'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints. Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press. In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, it is claimed Under-fire: Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app Uber Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app Uber and defended controversial comments made by an executive who suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company. Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter on Wednesday to show his support for beleaguered VP Emil Michael and described Sarah Lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as 'shady'. 'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his venture capital firm A-Grade. So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber. 'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued. And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards. According to Ms Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. Mr Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage. In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15 billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed. The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service, he said. Mr Michael was especially focused on Ms Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn't respect us or prioritize our safety.' Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly' Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities' He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers. In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his nor Uber's views. 'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company's views or approach,' he said. 'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.' At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers. An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'. The event at Waverly Inn on Friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including actor Ed Norton and publisher Arianna Huffington. Uber consultant: The dinner was hosted by Ian Osborne (pictured), ex-adviser to British PM David Cameron The event on Friday evening was attended by  actor Ed Norton (left) and publisher Arianna Huffington (right) Response: On Monday, Ms Lacy responded to BuzzFeed's article on her site (pictured), saying: 'Companies shouldn't be allowed to go to illegal lengths to defame and silence reporters' It comes as a legal battle between Nevada's highly regulated taxi industry and Uber stumbled into complications as two state judges laid claim to hearing the same case. In court on Monday, Clark County District Judge Douglas Herndon blamed the overlap on the state attorney general, who represents the Nevada Taxicab Authority and Nevada Transportation Authority. 'I think you're jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling,' he said. The state regulators want to put an end to Uber, which launched its ride-sharing services in Las Vegas, Reno and Carson City on October 24. Hours after the service was launched, the state hastily sought orders to halt the company's business in all three cities. The attorney general later filed a complaint and motions in Washoe County. On Monday, Uber asked the state Supreme Court to put a halt to the  case. The company expects a decision in several days."

They did not know that behind the doors the prizes included food, clean clothes – and various members of their friends and family. Kiki, who had been away from her mother for 18 days, was standing behind a yellow door. The youngster could hear her mother’s voice and was heartbroken when Miss Brooks and Mr Bristow picked the wrong colour to reveal a sign which said ‘game over’. Millions of viewers saw Kiki’s distress as she realised she would not see her mother and had to be consoled by one of Mr Bristow’s sons, who was next to her. Tough blow: Charlie described learning that her daughter could have been so close was like being 'kicked in the gut' Pulling at the heartstrings: Charlie was left in tears at the thought of her daughter being so close It was only after learning that two fellow contestants had got to see their loved ones that Miss Brooks, 31, realised she had missed the opportunity to see her daughter. She was left distraught and  made a tearful apology to the cameras, saying: ‘It felt like someone had taken a boot and kicked me in the guts. 'I didn’t even think having a member of family behind the  door would have been an option. This is heartbreaking.’ Yesterday experts and campaigners called on TV watchdog Ofcom to investigate the decision to involve Kiki in the contest, which is filmed in Australia, while others accused Miss Brooks of bad parenting for not leaving the jungle to comfort her daughter as soon as she learned what had happened. What's behind each door: Charlie and Eric were first to have a go at the Door to Door game, she didn't know her daughter Kiki was behind the yellow door End of the line: The pair chose the blue door and were greeted with a 'game over' sign Margaret Morrissey, of campaign group Parents Outloud, said: ‘If [Charlie Brooks] was genuine about this, she would have got up and walked straight to her daughter and not put her daughter in this position again. ‘I find it staggering that [producers] have used a child in this way. To involve a seven-year-old is sinking to the bottom.’ The stunt comes just days after producers were accused of failing to look after comedian Brian Conley, 51, who has battled depression and alcoholism. He left the jungle after becoming distressed and was admitted to hospital. Over the moon: The pair looked delighted to be greeted by their loved ones Group hug: Rosemary was seen hugging her daughter while David was delighted his mother was there to meet him Viewers took to the internet to express their outrage at Kiki’s treatment. One wrote: ‘For such a small child to hear her mother’s voice and look so desolate when she didn’t get to see her isn’t sitting comfortably with me.’ Another agreed, adding: ‘ITV should hang their heads in shame!’ Roy Shuttleworth, a consultant in clinical psychology, said the game amounted to a ‘high-risk strategy’, adding: ‘Some children would be tormented by it.’ A spokesman for the ITV show said permission for the girl to take part in the game had come from her grandmother, adding: ‘A senior producer saw Kiki afterwards and she was fine.  Kiki and her grandma come to the jungle every day with the other friends and family, so the experience wasn’t as out of the ordinary as it might look.’ An agent for Miss Brooks refused to comment on why Kiki was not at school."

In an interview Wednesday, Ahtisaari called for a fresh Middle East peace initiative and warned that western powers risked losing credibility unless they acted to solve the conflict. Ahtisaari told CNN's Jonathan Mann that peace was a ""question of will."" ""All conflicts can be settled and there are no excuses for letting them become eternal,"" said Ahtisaari, who was cited for his work promoting Namibian independence in southern Africa and for his ""central role"" promoting peace in the conflict-stricken Indonesian province of Aceh. ""It is simply intolerable that violent conflicts defy resolution for decades, causing immeasurably human suffering and preventing economic and social development."" Ahtisaari said that finding a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians was crucial to the future development of the entire Middle East and Muslim world. ""As Western nations we are losing our credibility... because we can't keep on talking, year after year, that we are doing something. And no one sees any results,"" he said. ""People are suffering on both sides, and the saddest thing is that if we don't help the parties to solve those problems that are in the way of getting the agreement in the Middle East, the situation will become even worse for both parties."" Ahtisaari also called for fresh efforts to eradicate world poverty: ""We must all be able to contribute to our future and to the future of our communities. If the present trend continues, we will be faced with a situation where hundreds of millions of young people will be out of work in countries that are in the early stages in development.

Laura Betzig, an evolutionary anthropologist from Michigan, has discovered that rulers such as Genghis Khan, Rameses the Great and Yangdi, the 6th-century Sui dynasty emperor systematically impregnated women, the latter fathering around 100,000 babies. It means that there are millions of people alive today with genetic traits associated with seeking power and oppressing people. Betzig explains that mass impregnations began around eight to nine thousand years ago when emperors and elites took over from hunter-gatherers. Betzig told The Sunday Times: ‘In evolutionary terms this period of human existence created an enormous selective pressure, with the guys at the top who had the least desirable traits passing on their genes to huge numbers of offspring.’ Her research covered the rulers of the first six great civilisations - Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, Mexico and Peru – but it was in China that mass impregnations was carried out the most systematically. Numbers game: Rameses the Great is thought to have fathered around 200 children Yangdi: The Chinese emperor is credited with impregnating a staggering 100,000 women One historian believes that Yangdi, the 6th-century Sui dynasty emperor, for example, had children with 100,000 women. For more than 2,000 years the system in China, said Betzig, was that women would be taken to the emperor to be impregnated when they were most fertile – and they had to be under 30 and attractive and symmetrical. The 13-century Mongol warlord Genghis Khan, meanwhile, is thought to have 16m male descendants, thanks to his habit of sleeping with scores of women. And Rameses the Great, who ruled Egypt 3,200 years ago, fathered 200 children. Some British lords also passed on their genes in a similar manner, with some having sex with hundreds of serfs, according to Betzig. Her research is published in the latest edition of Evolution & Human Behavior."

Detectives believe the man was behind both the triple slaying at a coffeehouse in the city's University District and the fatal shooting of a woman near downtown about a half-hour later, Assistant Police Chief Jim Pugel told reporters. The suspect shot himself in the head but was still alive Wednesday evening, police said. Two men were found dead at the coffeehouse, and a woman wounded in the shooting spree died in a hospital later. Two other men were listed in critical condition Wednesday afternoon. The second shooting left one woman dead in what police described as a possible carjacking about four miles away. Detectives ""feel very confident that unfortunately, these are all connected, but fortunately we have the person in custody,"" Pugel said. He said a plainclothes detective spotted the suspect in southwest Seattle, within two miles of where the sport-utility vehicle seen fleeing the second shooting had been ditched. The detective called in uniformed officers, and the man shot himself as they approached, Pugel said. Barely an hour earlier, police had released security-camera images of the yet-unidentified suspect at CafÃ© Racer, in the city's University District. Heavily armed police were used dogs to search the neighborhood around the cafe for much of Wednesday afternoon, neighbors said. ""The streets are blocked off, and there's tons of cops,"" said Joe Backus, the manager of a musical instrument shop next to CafÃ© Racer. Police told employees and customers to stay inside while the search was going on, he said. Nearby resident Evan Hill said he could hear the gunfire from his living room. ""I counted four or five shots and somebody shouting, and I ran out to my balcony and called 911,"" Hill told CNN affiliate KOMO. Hill called the cafe a ""very mellow"" venue that hosts artwork and musical performances. ""It makes you kind of angry that it would happen in a place like that,"" he said. Witnesses to the second shooting told police a woman and man were arguing in a parking lot when the man pulled out a pistol and shot the woman in the head. He took off in a black Mercedes sport-utility vehicle, which was found around noon in a neighborhood a few miles southwest of downtown with a pistol inside, Pugel said. Seattle, a city of about 600,000, recorded 20 homicides in 2011, according to Police Department statistics. Wednesday's rampage brings 2012's year-to-date total to 19. But Mayor Mike McGinn said there have been ""multiple tragic episodes of gun violence"" around the city in recent weeks. In an afternoon news conference with police, during which news of the suspect's shooting emerged, McGinn said ending that violence was ""the highest priority."" ""We will be working with our police to give them the tools they need to focus on violent offenders with access to guns,"" he said. ""But it's also going to take a focus on the laws that make it too easy for people to acquire guns. And it's going to also take a full partnership with the community to end a culture of violence where young men believe it's OK to attempt to resolve disputes with violence, including guns."""

Skype has now released the beta version of its live translation tool, allowing people to speak to others in another language - even if they don’t know what they’re saying. The tool translates speech instantly, providing both text and spoken translations. Scroll down for videos Washington-based Microsoft has released a preview of Skype Translator (shown). It lets people of different languages talk to each other on video calls. The software translates one language into text and speech of another. For now only Spanish and English are available - and you need to have a Windows 8.1 device You can sign up for the beta version of Skype Translator now on their website. For now the public version is only able to translate between English and Spanish - and you need a Windows 8.1 device to use it. But it will eventually have more than 40 languages available letting people of many countries speak to one another with ease. There's no news yet, though, on when the full version will be available. ‘Skype is now removing another barrier to make it possible for people to communicate irrespective of what language they speak,’ Microsoft’s Gurdeep Pall wrote in a blog post. To start using it, you simply need to choose a contact, turn on the ‘Translation’ switch for that person, and start typing or speaking if you’ve made a call. The programme analyses speech against audio snippets from millions of previously recorded samples, and transforms the audio into a set of text candidates. Speech disfluencies - like ‘ums’ and ‘ahs’ - are removed, and the top choice among the sound-alike words is made, getting the text ready for translation. The technology apparently knows how dozens of languages align with one another, by reviewing millions of pieces of previously translated content. The translator applies this knowledge to quickly translate text into another language. Increased usage and user feedback, plus constant refinement by human transcribers, will also help it get better and better. Skype Translator will eventually support more than 40 languages including - amusingly -Klingon from the Star Trek universe. ‘Skype Translator relies on machine learning, which means that the more the technology is used, the smarter it gets.’ ‘We are starting with English and Spanish, and as more people use the Skype Translator preview with these languages, the quality will continually improve.’ The service works by translating your speech as you talk. It provides a text version of your speech for the person on the other end of the line, and also reads out what it thinks the translation is. To turn it on, you simply need to select the translation setting before making a call to someone. Initial reports from the beta version say it is good, although not perfect. ‘For Skype Translator to work properly, there is a little mental conditioning involved,’ reported Gizmodo. ‘For one, you must speak slowly. Skype Translator's speech recognition is good, and plenty fast, but that accuracy decreases as you speed up in words per minute. ‘""Hey, how is it going?"" can change to ""Hey is going?"" pretty quickly.’ It’s also recommended that the speaker doesn’t ‘um’ and ‘ah’ too much, as this can confuse the translation tool.

Prosecutors allege that 22-year-old Jordan Graham was unhappy in her new marriage and deliberately shoved her blindfolded husband of eight days off a rock ledge during an argument while hiking a steep trail on July 7. She was indicted last month on charges of first- and second-degree murder in the death of Cody Johnson, 25. Her attorneys have insisted his death was an accident. Prosecutors, in filings in U.S. District Court in Missoula, said they plan to produce evidence at next month's trial that Graham made statements about killing her mother, Lindel Rutledge, and stepfather about five weeks before Johnson plunged to his death. They argued that Graham's remarks about killing her parents, made in the weeks before her wedding, would be used to 'negate innocent intent and demonstrate the likelihood that the defendant did an act with the requisite intent in the charged case,' according to legal documents filed late on Tuesday. Prosecutors also notified the court that they intend to prove Graham lied about alleged abuse she suffered in previous romantic relationships, arguing that such fabrications provided key insights about her state of mind and credibility. Accused: Jordan Linn Graham, center, leaves the courthouse after pleading not guilty to charges last month Graham told federal investigators that Johnson had 'tried to hold me down' during an argument at their home in the city of Kalispell just before the couple went for the hike at Glacier, court records show. She said that when her husband 'tried to grab my arm and my jacket' during the dispute and that she acted in self-defense by pulling away even as she pushed him, according to legal documents filed by Graham's federal defenders. Her attorneys have previously scolded prosecutors for labeling their client a sociopath and for theorizing that a cloth found near Johnson's body might have been used to blindfold him. Her lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. Prosecutors said in legal filings on Tuesday that an FBI forensic scientist who conducted tests on the material will testify at trial about 'the discovery of six human hairs embedded in the cloth.' A U.S. judge in September ordered Graham released from jail, fitted with an electronic monitoring device and placed in the custody of her parents at their Kalispell home pending trial. Earlier this month, Jordan Graham testified at her murder indictment that she instinctively pushed Cody Johnson away when he grabbed her arm, causing the July 7 fall. Victim: Cody Johnson's body was found at the bottom of a cliff in the Glacier National Park She also alleged that an FBI agent improperly interviewed her and made her uncomfortable by touching her knee. Graham, 22, and Johnson, 25, had been married for eight days when they argued over her doubts about the marriage, prosecutors said. Graham has pleaded not guilty, and said she was only attempting to remove Johnson's arm - not push him off the cliff. She repeated the claim on the stand on Friday that she was acting instinctively. She added that she felt uncomfortable in a July 16 interview with FBI Agent Stacey Smiedala, during which she dropped her previous claims that Johnson had driven off with friends. Graham's attorney Michael Donahoe alleged in court filings that Agent Smiedala interrogated his client alone and unrecorded for nearly one and a half hours so that he could 'shape' her statement to get Graham to admit she acted not instinctively, but in the 'heat of passion', required to file manslaughter charges. U.S. prosecutors say 22-year-old Jordan Graham was unhappy in her new marriage and deliberately shoved her husband of eight days off a rock ledge during an argument while hiking a steep trail on July 7 During that time, Agent Smiedala allegedly made her uncomfortable by sitting very close and touching her knee for extended periods of time, Graham testified. A shorter statement of Graham's version of events was then recorded and the agent 'told me that I was in the clear, that I wouldn't be seeing him again, and that I was free to go', she said.Her recorded statements were later distorted in the criminal complaint, Mr Donahoe alleged. Assistant U.S. Attorney Zeno Baucus said in court filings that Graham participated voluntarily, and that FBI agents conducted the interview and filed the complaint properly."

But in fact you are more likely to dwell on your problems than others. Researchers found consumers who buy luxury products after a personal failure are simply masking the issue rather than recovering. The study by Monika Lisjak of the Erasmus University, Andrea Bonezzi of New York University, Soo Kim of Cornell University, and Derek Rucker of Northwestern University showed shoppers who buy to boost their self-worth could actually feel worse. They said: “When consumers experience a psychological threat to how they would like to see themselves, buying products that signal accomplishment in the same area of their life could ironically cause them to dwell on their shortcomings. “This can strip consumers of their mental resources and impair their self-control.” The study invited participants to recall a time when their intelligence was undermined and what they did about it. Results showed that those who opted for a form of retail therapy were unhappier in the longer term. The researchers concluded: “Consumption can sometimes compensate for our blunders and failures, but this doesn’t always work. “Consumers who use products to boost their sense of self-worth tend to dwell on their shortcomings and their ability to exert self-control is impaired. “After experiencing a setback in one area of their life, consumers might be better off boosting their sense of self in a different area of their life. “For example, a consumer whose intelligence is undermined might be better off signalling their self-worth socially rather than trying to assert their intelligence.” The study was published in the Journal of Consumer Research.

Speaking before 10,000 people in the Democratic heartland of Boulder, Colorado, Obama, his voice hoarse, delivered a fiery 36-minute speech designed to whip up his base of voters and rekindle some of the magic of four years ago ahead of Tuesday's election. Scroll down for video His youngest fan? Obama high-fives a young girl while meeting with supporters after speaking at a campaign event at Franklin County Fairgrounds in Hilliard, Ohio, today Must win: Mitt Romney needs to take Virginia and Florida Obama has edged ahead in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls by just 0.1 per cent and appears to have an advantage in the crucial swing state of Ohio. He is very much in contention too in Virginia and Florida, which his opponent Mitt Romney must win. But Obama is campaigning in Wisconsin, Colorado and Nevada, states he won easily in 2008 and which hoped would have been in the bag by now. If Ohio, Florida and Virginia fall, his aides calculate, these states might save him. ‘Back in 2008, when we talked about change, I told you I wasn’t just talking about changing Presidents.  I wasn’t just talking about changing parties,’ Obama said in Boulder. ‘I was talking about changing our politics. ‘I ran because the voices of the American people - your voices - had been shut out of our democracy for way too long by lobbyists and special interests, and politicians who believe that compromise is a dirty word and who would say anything to win office, and do anything to stay in office.’ Change, again: Barack Obama brought up memories of the previous election campaign Plans: Obama said 'the future doesn't have many lobbyists' Despite having included many former lobbyists in his administration, Obama said: ‘The future doesn’t have lobbyists. They’ll never have as many lobbyists as the vested interests. Never have as many lobbyists as the past does.’ Lobbyists, however, have been frequent and repeated visitors to the Obama White House. According to the Washington Post, Tim Hannegan, who lists Taser International as a client has been to the White House more than 30 times under Obama. Bill Samuel, lobbyist for the AFL-CIO, has been by more than 50 times. Michael Taylor, a lobbyist for the Monsanto corporation, has been 25 times. Former Senator. Chris Dodd, a lobbyists for the Motion Picture Association of America, has been more than a dozen times. But the populist rhetoric was lapped up by the crowd as Obama promised 100,000 new ‘math and science teachers’ and training for two million workers. Aiming high: Obama pledged training for two million workers and more teachers Not the status quo: Romney said he was the real agent of change Obama sought to seize back the mantle of change from Romney, who has recently claimed he is the real candidate of change and Obama represents the status quo in Washington. ‘I know what real change looks like, because I fought for it,’ Obama said. ‘I've got the scars to prove it. You have, too. And after all that we've been through together, Colorado, we sure as heck can't give up now.’ The argument is unlikely to persuade many swing voters, who have become jaded after four years of high unemployment, soaring debt and partisan gridlock in Washington. But it is a message that resonates among diehard Democrats, who Obama desperately needs to go to the polls. Obama also looked back to the Bush years, blaming his predecessor for the mess that he had spent ‘four years cleaning up’ and harking back to President Bill Clinton’s time in the White House from 1993 to 2001. ‘We know the ideas that worked,’ Obama said in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ‘We also know the ideas that don't work. Because in the eight years after Bill Clinton left office, his policies were reversed.’ Obama speaking in Boulder, Colorado"

Camden's Gilbert Villanueva, 26, was today charged with fatally stabbing Suzanne DuRocher, 50, and viciously wounding his former flame Kristen DuRocher in their Merchantville, New Jersey home. Villanueva allegedly broke into the women's house on the 100 block of Prospect Street about 10.30pm, and went up to Kristen's bedroom on the second floor. When Suzanne heard the confrontation, she  tried to make Villanueva leave and he stabbed her with a pocket-knife, according to CBS. Police said he then stabbed Kristen. Kristen’s young daughter was also in the house but was unharmed. She is not Villanueva's child. Kristen and Villanueva had reportedly once dated, but their one-year relationship was tumultuous. CBS reported Kristen had taken out a restraining order against Villanueva on October 27, but dropped it on October 31. Villanueva, a father of two, also reportedly had four prior arrests for weapons and terrorist threats, including three convictions. Victims: Villanueva is accused of wounding 22-year-old Kristen Du Rocher, left, and stabbing her mom, 50-year-old Suzanne DuRocher (right) to death last night Last night, neighbor Andrew Kuppler told WPVI Kristen knocked on his door about 10.30pm and said she needed help for her and her mother. 'She looked like she was in shock. She had some obvious wounds to her arm,' Kuppler said. 'She just said she was attacked, she was stabbed, and that she needed some help, so we called 911 and told the police what was going on.' Suzanne, a mother of three, was rushed to Cooper University Hospital where she died from her wounds, while Kristen Durocher was in a stable condition. CBS reported investigators interviewed Villanueva’s sister who claimed she picked him up from behind a Dunkin’ Donuts on Marlton Pike. Police said he confessed to his sister that he stabbed the two women. Officers then found Villanueva after nurses at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden reported they were treating the man with suspicious 'knife wounds' on his hands about 11.30pm. Service provider: Suzanne DuRocher, 50, was an Associate Chief Nursing Officer of Operations at Temple University Hospital Sketchy history: Kristen DuRocher, left, had taken out a restraining order against Gilbert Villanueva, right, on October 27, but had it dropped on October 31 Courier-Post reported Kristen met Villanueva about a year ago at a Brooklawn Taco Bell where they both worked. The relationship quickly deteriorated, and DuRocher was granted a restraining order against her former lover. Even though she dropped it days later, he was not welcome at her home. Courier-Post also reported the murder suspect has another restraining order against him, which is still in place, that was filed by a woman in Burlington County in 2006. He has two children and another on the way. Scene: Gilbert Villanueva allegedly broke into the DuRocher's Merchantville, New Jersey home (pictured) before attacking the women Suzanne, a grandmother, was Temple University Hospital's associate chief nursing officer of operations. 'We extend our sincerest condolences to her family and friends as they begin to deal with the after-effects of this tragic loss,' the hospital said in a statement. 'For the past eight years, Suzanne has been a vital and well-respected member of the Hospital's leadership team. She touched each of us & and our patients & in a very special way. 'She eagerly shared with colleagues her extensive knowledge and commitment to advanced nursing practice in the delivery of quality, compassionate care to patients.' It is not the first time tragedy has touched the DuRocher family. Suzanne's husband, Robert DuRocher, was killed in an industrial accident in Moorestown, New Jersey on February 15, 2011, according to philly.com. Villanueva was arraigned on Thursday afternoon and is being held on $1.75 million bail."

However, most models and store mannequins are still extremely thin, and now an example has come to light of a store popular with young girls using a dummy resembling a seriously underweight woman. Budget fashion house Primark has promised to change a window display after a customer tweeted a picture of an anorexic looking mannequin. The mannequin in question was clearly the image of an underweight women, with obviously protruding ribs Concerned shopper Mel Fraser tweeted a picture of the skeletal dummy after spotting it in the shop window of the Glasgow branch. Wearing a bikini and printed trousers, the shockingly thin mannequin’s ribs were clearly protruding. Ms Fraser tweeted a picture of the dummy to bosses at Primark who tweeted back, promising to look into the matter straight away. She wrote: ‘ Dear Primark, is it really necessary that these new mannequins have protruding ribs? ‘And before I get anyone saying I’m skinny bashing, I’m not, I’d just like to see mannequins in all different shapes and sizes in all stores rather than young girls thinking this is the only way to be.’ Concerned shopper Mel Fraser tweeted a picture of the skeletal dummy after spotting it in the shop window of the Glasgow branch Her picture and caption was quickly re-tweeted more than 1400 times and Primark bosses thanked Ms Fraser for bringing the matter to their attention and promised an investigation. They tweeted back: ‘Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We’ll speak to our team tomorrow. Can you please let us know what store this was pls?’ Fitness instructor and mother of one Ms Fraser said she felt using only overly thin mannequins sent a worrying message to impressionable young shoppers. Primark responded to the complaint and now says it will change it's window display She said: ‘Primark shoppers tend to be young fashion conscious girls and I’m concerned that it sends a dangerous message to impressionable teenagers. ‘If you are going to have mannequins that are thin then they should at least be presented alongside other body shapes so not to enforce the message that very thin is the only desirable or acceptable body shape for women.’ Other twitter users also slammed the store. With users branding the use of the mannequin as ‘shocking, ‘disgusting,’ and ‘utterly terrifying.’ But others were quick to defend Primark with one user asking: ‘ What if you are naturally skinny, does that mean you can’t be represented?’ Earlier this year luxury Italian linger label La perla came under fire after a customer tweeted a picture of a mannequin on display in New York Ms Fraser insisted she was merely calling for more of a ‘variety’ of shapes to be represented to send a safer message. Yesterday the store announced: ‘We are currently changing our window displays.’ In a tweet to Ms Fraser bosses said: ‘ The mannequin you describe will not be used in this way again.’ Primark is not the first store to be lambasted for the use of thin mannequins. Earlier this year luxury Italian lingerie label La perla came under fire after a customer tweeted a picture of a mannequin on display in New York. Gap and Zara have also come under fire in the past. In 2007 Spanish label Mango agreed not to display mannequins smaller than a size 6 because: ‘Problems with eating disorders among Spanish Women.’"

No, quadruple it. Everything in South Korea's second largest city (after Seoul) is better than you think it's going to be, and you'll want more time to explore and enjoy. Case in point is Spa Land Centum City, a gigantic, modern jjimjilbang (Korean-style sauna/spa) located inside Shinsegae Department Store Centum City, reportedly the world's largest department store, which opened four years ago. Before seeing Spa Land, I had set aside an hour for a visit -- the usual amount of time I allot for soaking and scrubbing at a Korean bathhouse. Coming from Seoul, I was skeptical about how different one jjimjilbang could be from any other. The capital, after all, is well known for its extravagant spas. Boy, was I mistaken. A spa like no other Centum City's Spa Land takes the jjimjilbang concept to an entirely new place. While Seoul jjimjilbangs tend to be mobbed 24 hours a day with families and groups of friends, Spa Land presents a more refined, upscale and leisurely experience. Despite state-of-the-art facilities, admission fees are reasonable -- ₩12,000 ($10.50) on weekdays and ₩14,000 ($12.25) on weekends. Students get a slight discount and -- here's an interesting kicker -- children under 13 aren't allowed inside, an unheard of concept in Korea, where families often make weekend rituals of jjimjilbang visits. Another unusual feature is the four-hour limit on stays. Most Korean jjimjilbangs are open 24 hours and often serve as a crash pad for over-indulgent partiers, many of whom prefer to sleep off the effects of the night in a spa rather than face the repercussions of coming home late and smelling like the inside of a brewery vat. How to do Spa Land right The first thing Koreans want to know about a jjimjilbang is whether the water is special enough to bathe in. The water in Spa Land's baths and pools is pumped from two types of hot springs that lie 100 meters underground, and which are sterilized 36 times a day. The ""sodium bicarbonate hot spring"" is the ""beauty bathtub,"" said by the spa to ""remove your dead skin cells and make your skin and hair shiny."" The ""sodium chloride hot spring"" is ""similar to seawater"" and has a ""heat-preservation effect"" that is ""good for blood circulation and helps to relieve pain from neuralgia and backache."" The spa ritual itself is familiar. Visitors change into cotton shirts and pants handed out at reception. Then they head to communal areas. There's a tarot card reading station set up near the entrance, but most people beeline past this and head straight for the outdoor foot bath area. Here there's a large heated pool for wading back and forth, as well as private booths where couples often play games on their phones while perched precariously above pools of water. Theme rooms Spa Land has dreamed up a variety of themes for its many steam and sauna rooms. These range from extremely hot (I couldn't enter this one without yelping in pain) to extremely cold (the Ice Room has a cute, fake jellyfish aquarium) to the gimmicky. How gimmicky? The walls of the pyramid room are set at a 52-degree angle, ""which has been said to be the easiest angle to collect energies from the universe,"" according to the spa. The SEV room ""radiates electrons from SEV"" meant to ""metabolize your body rapidly."" The theme rooms are fun to take pictures in. The downstairs snack bar serves bingsu (a beloved Korean shaved ice dessert) and various vinegar drinks said to be good for the skin. Customers can take the snacks and eat them all around the bathhouse. Upstairs there's a restaurant and cafe run by chefs from the Westin Chosun Hotel. Alcohol consumption is limited to 500 ml per person, to prevent sauna accidents and overly rambunctious parties from disrupting the austere atmosphere. Bath time My favorite spot in the spa is the outdoor rock pool in the women-only bathing area. I soaked under its sodium bicarbonate waterfall for a good 20 minutes before my appointment with the seshin ajumma (scrub ladies) in the scrub room. For 25 minutes I beached myself on a plastic slab, and gave myself over to the capable hands of a professional scrubber. Clad in black bras and panties (standard scrub uniform), she scoured my entire body with two loofahs. ""Young ladies are the most sensitive,"" she said in an amused voice when I squeaked a little. ""The older ladies always ask for the hardest pressure."" I emerged red and raw, but wonderfully clean. It was the best extra ₩20,000 ($18) I've ever spent in spa. Next time I'll plan on three hours for a visit. Make that four. Spa Land, Centum City, 35 Centumnam-daero, Haeundae-gu, Busan, South Korea; +82 51 745 2900; open daily, 6 a.m.-midnight"

He denies those allegations. Foster has been married to German-born model and singer Romina Reinhart since 2011. They have two children together.

However, she also takes thinly-veiled swipes at Foster, who ended his relationship with her. 'Men these days are real quick to lie and say what they can to get what they want but they say peace real quick when a baby is involved,' she tweeted.

Support for a republic in Australia has dropped to its lowest level in three decades, with more than half of Australians in favour of keeping the royal family as heads of state. According to a Fairfax-Nielsen poll, 51 percent of Australians believed the switch to a republic was unnecessary and only 42 percent were in favour of a republic. Scroll down for video The Republican Slayer: Prince George and his famous parents are responsible for the upswing in support among Australians for the monarchy This is down from 58 percent in favour of a republic in 1999, when a referendum on the issue was held, and represents the lowest ebb in pro-republican sentiment in the country in 35 years. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and their son Prince George, are thought to be responsible for the resurgence of support for the monarchy. Prince George was dubbed 'Prince George the Republican Slayer' on Australian breakfast television on Wednesday. The survey found support for the royals was at its highest among Australians aged 18-24, 60 percent of whom thought Australia should keep its royal head of state, and only 28 percent supporting a transition to a republican system of government. However, a majority of Australian voters support Australia becoming a monarchy eventually. According to the poll, only 35 percent believed Australia should 'never' become a republic. Most Australians believe the nation should become a republic either 'as soon as possible'(28 percent) or 'after Queen Elizabeth's reign ends' (31 percent). A new poll shows that support among Australians for a republic is at its lowest level in 35 years The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured here arriving in Wellington, will arrive in Sydney on Wednesday afternoon for a ten-day tour of the country However David Morris, national director of the Australian Republican Movement, remains hopeful that one day the Australian head of state will be an Australian. 'We shouldn’t jump to conclusions based on one poll that’s held in the middle of a media frenzy about a huge celebrity royal visit,' he said. 'The British royals will always be welcome in Australia… We look forward to when an Australian head of state visits Britain and receives the same welcome that the British royal family always receives; when an Australian head of state is received as an equal and not as a colonial subject.' He added that support for the monarchy was due to the celebrity status of Will and Kate, as well as the fact there has been no broad political debate on the issue in over a decade. He also blamed the current spike in pro-royal sentiment on having a prime minister who ‘is trying to take us back to the colonial era.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was an ardent defender of the monarchy in the lead up to the 1999 referendum, announced last month that he would be reinstating the titles of knights and dames for 'pre-eminent Australians'. However, only 35 percent of Australians are in favour of bringing back the titles, according to another Fairfax Media poll.

""We immediately took those concerns very, very seriously,"" and informed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to request a review, Philbin said. ESPN also reported that Martin never brought his concerns to Philbin. But many who know the ins and outs of pro football say Philbin should have known what was going on in his ranks and taken action much sooner. ""The recent developments in the Jonathan Martin-Richie Incognito situation (have)shown us one thing: Joe Philbin is to blame for the turmoil in the Miami Dolphins' locker room,"" writes Gil Alcaraz of rantsports.com. ""First and foremost, an NFL head coach needs to know what's going on within his own locker room. If there's a player bullying another player, sending him threatening voice mails and text messages while making him feel uncomfortable on a daily basis, the head coach has to be aware of it."" The central allegation against Incognito involves messages to Martin, including a voice mail in which Incognito allegedly used racial slurs, threatened physical violence, and used the words, ""I'll kill you."" Martin's representatives have turned materials over to the NFL for an investigation. Incognito allegedly also got Martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to Las Vegas by a group of Dolphins even though Martin preferred not to travel with them. Martin gave Incognito the money, fearing the consequences if he did not, ESPN reported. Incognito, on Twitter, accused a news organization of ""attaching my name to false speculation,"" but that tweet and others were later deleted, according to bleacherreport.com. Incognito has been suspended; Martin left the team. It's unclear what lies in store for either of them. Incognito said Tuesday he is ""weathering the storm right now."" Richie Incognito, Jonathan Martin, and the NFL's future Philbin ""is ultimately to blame here,"" Dan Shanoff writes at USAToday. ""... Philbin either actively neglected his team culture (his claim) or he knew and did nothing (which would be worse). Let's give him the benefit of the doubt -- at best, he is an appallingly ineffective leader."" The Sun Sentinel reports that Dolphins coaches had asked Incognito to toughen up Martin -- orders he may have taken too far. The report does not say whether Philbin himself made the request. Philbin did tell players each year to ""cut out"" rookie hazing, the paper reports. But how much are NFL coaches really expected to police their teams? By and large, they ""let their players, and especially their seasoned veterans, maintain harmony in the locker room,"" Ken Belson writes in the New York Times. ""In the crudest sense, they are hired to build a winning team, and as long as players do their jobs well, what happens elsewhere is largely immaterial."" ""To some extent, the inmates run the asylum,"" Trevor Pryce, a defensive end who spent 14 years in the NFL, told the Times. ""The coaches have a lot of other things to deal with."" No organization speaks for all NFL coaches. The NFL Coaches Association ""represents the interests of nearly 500 assistant coaches,"" according to the website of its executive director, David Cornwell. He was not immediately available Wednesday to discuss this issue. Ricky Williams, who played with Incognito in Miami, said he believes a coach should only step in if behind-the-scenes behavior affects play on the field. ""The locker room, we keep coaches out for a reason. It's our space,"" Williams told KGMZ-FM in San Francisco, according to NFL.com. There is ""a lack of leadership in that locker room,"" he said of the Dolphins. Some coaches have been credited with taking disturbing behavior seriously. ""Hall of Famer Bill Walsh's coaching tree never tolerated any form of hazing or harassing. Pete Carroll doesn't allow it in Seattle. Jimmy Johnson and Mike Shanahan have said they've never witnessed bullying to the extent that is alleged in this circumstance,"" NFL.com reports. As the conflict between Incognito and Martin spirals into a time of reckoning for the entire NFL, league officials face the task of laying out in clear terms just what coaches are responsible for -- and how to punish coaches when their players cross the line. Philbin has compared running a team to running a school. When his two children go to school each day, ""I have certain expectations that the administration, the teachers and the staff are going to create a safe atmosphere where my children can learn and develop as people,"" he said at his news conference Monday. ""This is no different,"" he added. ""I take this responsibility very seriously."" But even if Philbin shoulders blame for what allegedly transpired in his team, he's not alone, says columnist Jen Floyd Engel of foxsports.com. She points to others in the team's leadership and the players themselves. ""(I)t is every person who saw what was happening to Martin and did nothing who deserve our condemnation."""

So says a study out of Newcastle University in northeast England, published online Wednesday in the academic journal Anthrozoos. The researchers found that farmers who named their cows Betsy or Gertrude or Daisy improved their overall milk yield by almost 500 pints (284 liters) annually. ""Just as people respond better to the personal touch, cows also feel happier and more relaxed if they are given a bit more one-to-one attention,"" Catherine Douglas of the university's School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development said in a news release. ""By placing more importance on the individual, such as calling a cow by her name or interacting with the animal more as it grows up, we can not only improve the animal's welfare and her perception of humans, but also increase milk production."" Douglas and her colleagues questioned 516 dairy farmers in the United Kingdom. Almost half said they called the cows on their farms by name and reported a higher milk yield. A press statement from the university, touting the study, quoted Dennis Gibb, who co-owns a dairy farm outside of Newcastle, called Eachwick Red House Farm. ""We love our cows here at Eachwick, and every one of them has a name,"" Gibb said. ""Collectively, we refer to them as 'our ladies,' but we know every one of them and each one has her own personality."""

Nolberto was mid-way through his band Alkala's song ‘Yo por tu amor’ (Me for your love) at a carnival in Ranchillos, Argentina, when he placed his hand on a metal pole. Dramatic mobile phone footage shows him convulsing as the volts start to surge through his body. Scroll down for video Electrifying performance: Nolberto sings on stage with his band during an Argentinian carnival - so far so good Bad choice: During the performance, Nolberto walks across the stage to grab hold of part of the set, to emphasize his lyrics Sizzling show: As Nolberto grabs the metal pole, electricity shoots through his body and the shirt on his back even emits smoke as he is shocked Smoke then starts to rise from his arms, and he collapses off the stage. With the audience screaming in terror, security men rushed to his unconscious side. After several minutes, Nolberto regained consciousness and, like a true professional, returned to the stage to continue the show. ‘Nothing like this has ever happened to me before,’ Nolberto, from the Dominican Republic, later told Diario La Provincia. As the electric shock makes his body shake, Nolberto throws himself off the stage to avoid further injury Recovering: The singer is helped up from the floor and aided out of the crowd by a member of security Lucky shot: The performer says he knew he had to throw himself off the stage in order to avoid being electrocuted ‘What happened was that the stage was damp, and when I touched the metal I was shocked. So to stop myself from being electrocuted I had to throw myself off the stage,’ he added. It might make the Argentinian singer feel a little bit better, knowing that he probably won't make the same mistake again. Scientists at Oxford University have discovered a part of the brain that helps stop humans from making bad decisions. While other parts of the brain keep tabs on how well decisions are working, this new region thinks over what we might have done instead."

The Newsnight presenter revealed he thinks he now looks like Albert Steptoe and said he should probably shave it off if he wants to look his age. Writing in a Sunday newspaper, he said a friend had told him the beard made him look older, adding: ‘If you’re 63, this is not necessarily a good idea. ‘Wilfrid Brambell played Albert Steptoe when he was only 50, and it was the beard (now I come to think of it, not very dissimilar to my own)... Would we have believed he really ate pickled onions in the bath had he been clean-shaven? Of course not.’ After Paxman unveiled the facial fuzz last week, he accused BBC colleagues of pognophobia, an irrational fear of beards, after they questioned whether he should front the show unshaven. Paxman says becoming the poster-boy for beards has been a 'heavy burden'. The Newsnight presenter became the centre of a Twitterstorm last week but reactions to his facial hair were divided - with some viewers saying he looked like a 'rubbish Doctor Who'. The 63-year-old said he has been shocked by the reaction to his stubble. He said he was surprised about the widespread reporting about of his facial hair that he called 'a storm in a shaving mug.' Paxman said the reaction 'may explain why beardies seem to consider themselves an oppressed minority.' The presenter said men with beards have shouted words of encouragement in the street, asking him not to shave it off. He wrote: 'I had joined a section of society that I fully expect - indeed I demand - merits the sort of legal protection accorded to other minorities.' Paxman unveiled his new hairy face for the first time on Monday. Within minutes of his appearance, it became one of the most talked-about subjects on Twitter. Paxman’s colleague Emily Maitlis responded by joking: ‘Right that’s it. I’m working on a moustache for Thursday’s Newsnight.’ Last week, the presenter accused the BBC of pogonophobia - an irrational fear of beards - and said the only beards acceptable to the corporation are worn by Uncle Albert on Only Fools and Horses, Demis Roussos or Abu Hamza. Paxman said the more powerful men become, the more clean shaven they are likely to be. The presenter said he is tempted to shave his beard off because friends said it makes him look older Newsreader Emily Maitlis tweeted this doctored picture of herself during the Paxman beard 'Twitterstorm' However, he said vanity and the aging effect of his beard means he is considering shaving off his facial hair. He wrote that his friends have told him his new look makes him look older.

'I'm finding it quite a heavy burden.'"

The electric-powered vehicle, which is the size of a single molecule, has a chassis and four paddle-shaped wheels and is roughly one-billionth the size of a traditional hatchback car. Its maiden journey wasn't exactly epic -- six nanometers -- and its fuel-efficiency wasn't world-beating either, needing a jolt of 500 millivolts every half revolution of its wheels. But it's an important milestone in nanotech research (the science of manipulating matter at molecular scale), say scientists, because it demonstrates that single molecules can absorb external electrical energy and turn this into targeted motion. ""To build the nanotechnology of the future like nanorobots, machines and transporters you need something to fuel it. So there is a great incentive to build motors at the nanoscale,"" said Ben Feringa, professor of organic chemistry at the University of Groningen, and one of the authors of the research. ""There are many nanosystems built from all kinds of materials, but this is, as far as we can tell, the first time a nanomotor has been used to propel something by fueling it."" The fuel in this instance came from a scanning tunnelling microscope (STP) with its atom-sized stylus acting as an electrode allowing electricity to flow from its tip to the surface beneath it, Feringa says. ""When there is a molecule, the current goes through it and electricity excites the motor which drives the car forward,"" Feringa said. The discovery, say scientists, takes them a step closer to understanding and ultimately mimicking nature's highly efficient molecular robots. ""In living cells there are a whole variety of molecule motors that are involved in almost every important biological process like cell division and transport, and mobility in our muscles,"" Feringa said. The world's smallest synthetic motor was created by Alex Zettl, professor of physics at University of California, Berkeley in 2003 while the first nano car (without a motor) was built by James Tour in 2005. ""The Feringa team is to be congratulated for their excellent work,"" said Tour, a professor of chemistry at Rice University, Texas. ""It will certainly propel the field to a higher level of sophistication with the eventual goal of synthetic molecular machines being used for controlled transport and ex vivo (in an artificial environment outside an organism) bottom-up assembly..."" he added. But it's still early days and Feringa says he feels a bit like the Wright Brothers, likening the nano car to their ""fairly awkward-looking primitive plane"" when compared to the passenger jets of today. ""It's very difficult to know where the future will go and ultimately the systems will be different. But first you have to find the fundamental principles. That makes things possible,"" he said. The research, which was completed in conjunction with scientists from the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa) is published in the journal Nature."

Members of the Unite union working for dnata at the three airports had been due to walk out tomorrow, but will be balloted on revised proposals. Unite regional officer Kevin Hall said: 'Unite is pleased to confirm that strike action has been suspended following a revised offer which better reflects the contribution our members make to the company. Unite union had called for peace talks to avoid disruption at airports on December 23 and 24, and thankfully it appears some common ground has been reached 'All of this could have been avoided if the company hadn't refused requests to negotiate and go to ACAS a number of weeks ago. We will now be putting the details of the revised pay offer to our members over the coming weeks.' A spokesperson for dnata told TravelMole: 'During dnata's recent discussions with Unite and ACAS, the two parties have come to an agreement on the salary award for dnata's Unite members. Unite has accepted dnata's offer of an increase in salary of 2.25 per cent, and a one-time payment of £175 for all employees.' Three of Heathrow's five terminals were going to be affected, as well as Gatwick and Manchester Airports. The strike would have affected check-in desks at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester airports The Unite union, which was behind the strike, said its members who work for air services provider dnata at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester had voted by more than four to one in favour of the action. Dnata's main customers include Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, Cathay Pacific, Turkish Airlines and Qantas Airways. The union said the strike was in protest at an imposed 2.2 per cent pay increase at a time when supervisors were being granted a rise of 4.5 per cent. Unite represents around a quarter of the 1,900 dnata staff who carry out check-in, ground crew and cargo duties at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester Airports. Turnout among the 460 Unite members eligible to vote was just 45 per cent. Of those who voted, some 83 per cent supported the strike 'if the company continued to refuse to negotiate'. Unite said it was not its intention to wreck Christmas for families, but simply to get the firm around the negotiating table. However it appears, at least for now, anyone travelling away this Christmas may escape added stresses to their holiday. Gatwick had earlier confirmed that as Dnata have only a small operation at the airport, no passengers would be affected if the strike had gone ahead."

Writing in his column in The Independent, former Manchester United and Three Lions midfielder Scholes said: 'I still have my concerns about the diamond formation in midfield (for England) and most of all about Jack Wilshere’s role in it.

'But I just do not believe that playing in front of the back four, on his own, suits him.' The 11-time Premier League winner also made comparisons between Wilshere and himself, believing both to be 'attacking' midfielders by nature. Scholes claims Wilshere is being asked to play in an undefined role, almost a middle-ground between attacking and defensive midfield. He continued: 'Wilshere is an attacking midfielder, as I was for most of my career. He is not a defensive midfielder and I feel at the moment he is stuck between the two roles. He is being asked to control the play from a deep position, which does not play to his strengths.'

It's very important that we concentrate on how we play there and how we present ourselves. 'We need to have the courage, we don't have to fear them.

'I'd like to have a team that fights for 90 minutes and has the confidence to show what kind of team we are. If we do that then what ever the score is I'm happy.' The Capital One Cup has provided a welcome distraction from their league struggles but Hyypia insists the club, who reached the play-offs in the last two seasons, can still have a successful campaign. 'I have high targets for this season still and we still have time to reach those targets but something needs to change,' he said. 'We need to toughen up and then hopefully we'll get the results as well.' Â"

Intel has pulled an ad campaign from popular video game news site Gamasutra. The move is in response to a online protest by a group of gamers upset with a column by the site's editor-at-large, Leigh Alexander. A veteran games journalist, Alexander is one of many writers who have recently been critical of parts of the gamer culture and the male-centric ""gamer"" identity. Gamasutra confirmed the action on Twitter, saying ""Yes, our partners at @intel were flooded with complaints over a recent opinion piece, and they did pull an ad campaign."" The tension began in August when critic and academic Anita Sarkeesian released the latest episode in her YouTube show on female tropes in video games. Around the same time, a game designer named Zoe Quinn was attacked online by an ex-boyfriend who claimed she cheated on him with a games journalist. Both women found themselves at the receiving end of graphic threats of violence from defensive gamers and Internet trolls. Sarkeesian contacted the police and had to temporarily leave her home. The backlash against the two soon spread to journalists and others who were critical of the gaming status quo and the way women are treated in the medium. On the other end are gamers who feel their subculture is being threatened. Some game players worry that activists will cause game makers to change their product to please a wider audience. They started rallying under the #Gamergate hashtag. Supporters of the Gamergate movement, who are well organized and driven, say they are actually combating corrupt games journalism. In the case of Alexander, they say her columns were ""offensive"" and ""racist."" The emails to Intel were part of a larger campaign against sites that have published content they find offensive, including Kotaku and Polygon. After confirming that Intel had indeed pulled the ads, a company spokesperson told Re/Code on Wednesday, ""We take feedback from our customers very seriously especially as it relates to contextually relevant content and placements."" Intel declined to comment further to CNN."

The singer’s spokesman claimed she had created Tara Entertainment Ltd to deal with her international earnings simply because her accountant is Irish rather than as a way of paying a lower rate of company tax. Tara, which was set up in 2001, and its British-based parent company CC Entertainment International, were put into voluntary liquidation in the last two months, prompting speculation the star is keen to avoid accusations she is dodging UK tax. Cheryl Cole (in between Mel B and Simon Cowell) was introduced to the accountant Alan McEvoy by her former manager Louis Walsh (left) However last night Cole’s publicist Sundraj Sreenivasan insisted the change in her financial arrangements was because her accountant Alan McEvoy had moved to London. Mr Sreenivasan added that the star had been introduced to Mr McEvoy by Girls Aloud former manager Irish impresario Louis Walsh. In a statement he said: ‘Cheryl has used the same accountant in Ireland for 13 years. The accountant was recommended by Louis Walsh, who at the time managed her as part of Girls Aloud. Her accountant has recently set up an office in London so Cheryl’s Irish company has been dissolved.’ The change in Cole’s tax affairs came just days before George Michael, Gary Barlow and dozens of other celebrities learned they are liable for millions in unpaid taxes after HMRC ruled an investment vehicle they had used was a tax avoidance scam. While Cole’s actions are legal, the last accounts for Tara showed assets of £2.5 million at the end of 2012, suggesting the star had funnelled at least this much through the company. Girls Aloud: Sarah Harding, Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Cole and Kimberley Walsh If this was the case the singer would have avoided paying £200,000 in tax that would have been owed in Britain. This is the difference between Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate compared to the 21 per cent rate in the UK. Documents for the liquidation of the company, CC Entertainment – which in 2013 declared only £1 in net assets – now show it has £1.88 million funds, which is likely to be paid to Cole as the company’s sole owner. She has married her French lover Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, 33, after a whirlwind three-month romance."

Levels of radioactivity found in Pacific bluefin tuna that spawned off Japan around the time of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident are far below anything that would pose a health risk and have dropped in fish caught the following year, U.S. researchers reported Monday. The latest findings follow up on a 2012 study that found radioactive cesium, a nuclear reactor byproduct, in tuna caught off California in the months after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi. The attention that study received led scientists to take another look at the data, said Nicholas Fisher, a marine science professor at New York's Stony Brook University. ""People did not know how to translate that into a dose, or into what risk do I have from eating that tuna,"" Fisher said. ""The paper that's coming out today addresses that."" They found that anyone who eats the bluefin -- highly prized for sushi and sashimi -- would get about 5% of the radiation they'd get from eating one typical banana, a fruit high in naturally radioactive potassium. The results were released Monday by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Even subsistence fishermen, who eat far more fish than the typical American, would receive a dose of radiation from the cesium isotopes released in the meltdown equivalent to a single dental X-ray, Fisher and his colleagues reported. That translates to a ""worst-case scenario"" of two additional cancer deaths for every 10 million people in that category, he said. The doses were calculated from fish caught off San Diego in August 2011. A follow-up study with fish caught in 2012 found the amount of cesium-134 and -137 dropped by about half in those tuna, Fisher said. ""Even if we use the higher concentrations, the concentrations we measured in 2011, the doses to human consumers are very low, and lower than the naturally occurring radionuclides,"" he said. Cesium-137 has a radioactive half-life of about 30 years, and traces of the isotope still persist from above-ground nuclear bomb tests in the 1950s and '60s. But cesium-134, which has a half-life of only two years, clearly came from the meltdowns, the researchers say. There are other reasons to worry about the Pacific bluefin, such as overfishing and mercury contamination. Anyone who eats a large quantity of bluefin over a long period would be more likely to see ill effects from mercury -- which can damage the brain and nervous systems of young or unborn children -- before facing the threat of cancer from radioactive cesium, Fisher said. The three operating reactors at Fukushima Daiichi melted down after the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011, creating the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. The crippled plant's owner is still trying to manage hundreds of thousands of tons of radioactive water used to cool the reactors, and scientists believe some of that is still seeping into the Pacific. The waters near the plant remain closed to fishing, and Japan has tightened its standards to keep any contaminated catch from reaching consumers. While the earthquake killed more than 15,000 people, no deaths have been blamed on the nuclear disaster that followed. In May, the World Health Organization concluded that only a small group of people will face an additional cancer risk from the meltdowns, but more than 100,000 people have had to evacuate towns surrounding the plant."

Both these clean-cut men sitting at the bar in polo-style shirts have a lot in common. They work at the nearby Severstal steel company. They're nearing retirement. And they both have strong opinions about who the next president should be. But their politics are as different as their taste in beer. ""I'm not for Obamacare, I'm not for his immigration policies, I don't particularly agree with 100% of his economic policies,"" Bengelsvorf said. For the record, he's a Bud Light guy -- and a Mitt Romney supporter. ""We can't go further into debt, and Obama is putting us further and further into debt by all these stimulus plans."" Flynn, a Miller Lite guy, supports President Barack Obama. If it weren't for the Obama-backed health care law, Flynn said his friend's unemployed son (a recent college graduate) wouldn't have health insurance coverage. CNN Poll: Health care ruling has not impacted race for White House, so far When it comes to the economy, Flynn admits it's taking too long to recover from the recession. But he said that ""going back to the policies that got us into this mess is not the direction we want to go."" Severstal supplies steel to the big three automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- so Flynn's and Bengelsvorf's jobs are tied to the auto industry. Both agree on one thing: The $80 billion federal bailout of the auto industry was good for their jobs. Still, Bengelsvorf looks at it through broader lens. At one point he said, ""The other side of me says you don't bail out a company that's going bankrupt."" These two friends epitomize what we found when hitting the road in the Rust Belt. CNN took the pulse of voters in auto towns in Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio -- important states that could make or break Election Day for Obama and Romney. In 2008, Obama captured all four states. But this year Indiana is leaning toward Romney -- and Ohio is a tossup. In the 12 elections between 1964 and 2008 no presidential candidate has won without winning Ohio. This year Ohio has about 30,000 fewer auto manufacturing jobs than it did in 2007. Michigan has 50,000 fewer automaking jobs. On the bright side, Michigan and Ohio, respectively, have seen the nation's biggest percentage declines in unemployment over the past two years. Make no mistake, these four states hold keys to the White House because all together they have 55 of 270 electoral votes needed to win. As Obama makes a second journey down the campaign trail, he's touting the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler -- and you can bet he'll continue to do so. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, opposed the bailout and pushed for a privately financed, managed bankruptcy of the two automakers. Watch: Politics in a former GM town During a stop at the Half Moon Restaurant & Brewery in Kokomo, Indiana, a lot of folks with auto industry ties wanted to talk politics, including Cliff Pitcher and his friend DeWayne Bates. Just like in Michigan -- these two auto-industry friends are not supporting the same candidate. Bates doesn't think the president deserves another four years. Pitcher does. ""Mitt Romney, I like his economical experience and his business experience, and I think that would help get our country job growth and help us get back on our feet,"" said Bates, a retired Chrysler millwright. Pitcher, an electrician at one of four Kokomo Chrysler plants, counters, ""Romney might be able to create jobs, but they're gonna pay $7 or $8 an hour and you know ... I can't support my family on $7 or $8 with no benefits. Numbers don't mean anything in the creation of jobs if they're not quality jobs."" As a member of the autoworkers' union that traditionally skews Democratic, Bates said he feels like his support for Romney puts him in the minority. But other union autoworkers spoke out who take issue with Obama's economic policies -- particularly the auto bailout -- and are throwing their support behind Romney. Among them are Brian Pannebecker, who has worked at a Ford factory in Sterling Heights, Michigan, for 16 years. In Pannebecker's view, Obama shouldn't have bailed out the industry. His company, Ford, did not take a bailout. ""What I object to is all of the taxpayer dollars that were used,"" Pannebecker said. ""I think markets need to be allowed to work. And there were some fundamental problems that GM and Chrysler had that really were of their own making."" Just a few miles away from Pannebecker, electrician Stacy Steward stood in blistering 95-degree heat across the street from the Chrysler plant where she had just finished a long day's work. After being laid off from Chrysler in 2008 and out of work for 17 months, she said she was rehired one month after the auto bailout. CNN Poll: Economic optimism jumping ""The Big Three support the entire state of Michigan,"" Steward said. ""The auto loans didn't just help Chrysler and GM; the auto loan also helped all of our suppliers. It helped all the small businesses in the areas. It helped the citizens."" Throughout this road trip in every town we visited -- large or small -- autoworkers expressed countless combinations of opinions about the state of the economy and the political direction of the nation. Come November, after all the stump speeches across the Rust Belt are said and done, many of these folks will cast their votes, hoping their candidate will take the nation's highest office. Some will get their way -- and others won't. No doubt it will be fascinating to watch. CNN Electoral Map Read more on 2012 at CNNpolitics.com Watch CNN Newsroom weekdays 9am to 3pm ET and weekends.

Known as a something of a party school, Colorado State University is likely no stranger to tamer soirees of 50 or so beer-swilling students. So nothing seemed out of the ordinary when, at around 8:30pm on April 27, Fort Collins, Colorado police showed up to a party of that size to address a noise complaint. Scroll down for video Dangerous: A party at Colorado State University, pictured, that began with 50 students soon swelled to 800 before police stepped in with tear gas Police left, but when they came back things had taken a turn. Though only two hours had passed, when cops came back at 11pm, the group had swelled to a full-on block party with anywhere from 300 to 800 wild students. Revelers representing a row of six or seven condominiums, just a few blocks from CSU’s campus, yelled ‘F*** the police!’ and ‘Go CSU.’ Eyewitnesses told the CSU college paper the Rocky Mountain Collegian that people were hanging from streetlights, climbing onto house roofs and even the roof of one car that they caused to collapse. ‘I’d call that a riot,’ Ft. Collins police Lt. Russell Reed told the Collegian. ‘When our officers have to use gas to get themselves out of a situation because of the immaturity of the crowd… yeah, that’s a riot. As police tried to break up what had become dangerous situation, some students’ verbal assaults became physical. Wild: One student took to Twitter to document the wild party that cops ended with riot gear after it swelled to 800 with the help of social media Officers were hit by beer bottles hurled through the air and that’s when they decided to fire cans of tear gas into the crowd. ‘I got gassed so bad,’ said senior Max Firth. ‘I couldn’t see, I couldn’t breathe. I just started running away.’ One student sporting a head wound even reported getting hit directly by a tear gas canister. Ft. Collins police spokeswoman Rita Davis said in a release that three officers incurred minor injuries and were transported to a hospital for treatment. Students said the party got so unwieldy after news of it spread through social media sites like Facebook. Lt. Reed said not enough officers were on hand to make any arrests from the huge crowd, but that some of his men recorded the unfortunate incident and plan to use footage to make arrests in the future.

Bayern Munich players react to the crowd after their staggering 12-1 aggregate victory over Sporting. Leading 5-0 from the first leg, a double from Lukas Podolski and Anderson Polga's own goal put them 3-0 up on the night within 40 minutes before Joao Moutinho pulled one back in stunning fashion. It was the briefest respite for Sporting, though, Bastian Schweinsteiger hitting an immediate reply, before Mark van Bommel, Miroslav Klose (pen) and Thomas Muller netted in the second half for a 7-1 triumph on the night. The result was a record aggregate winning margin for a post-group stage Champions League game, surpassing Lyon's 10-2 demolition of Werder Bremen in 2005. The scoring began in the eighth minute, Podolski combining well with Ze Roberto on the edge of the box after Bayern took advantage of a poor defensive clearance before hammering home from the edge of the box. Bayern were rampant and the second finally came after 34 minutes when a long kick from the Bayern keeper Jorg Butt sailed through to the edge of the Sporting area. It should have been simple for the visiting defense, but a horrible mix-up between Polga and and Patricio allowed Podolski to flick the ball over his head and into the empty net. Polga's night got even worse 39 later when he scored an own goal, volleying Schweinsteiger's cross into his own net. There was a brief hiatus in Sporting's embarrassment when Moutinho's classy strike arrowed into the far left corner three minutes before the break to reduce the arrears. But barely a minute later, Christian Lell pulled the ball back for Schweinsteiger to sweep home, making it 9-1 on aggregate. Bayern coach Jurgen Klinsmann made two changes at half-time, bringing on Jose Sosa and Breno for Ze Roberto and Lucio as the pace dropped. A fifth did arrive, though, in the 74th minute, substitute Muller's cross headed across goal by Klose for Van Bommel to control and fire home. And Klose continued to pile on the woe for Sporting in the 82nd minute, picking himself up from a foul by Pedro Silva to convert the subsequent penalty. Teenager Muller, making his Champions League debut, rounded things off in the final minute, poking home from Sosa's corner."

Jacoby Kindred, pastor of One Accord Ministries, was reported by the girls' mother in July when she found a note one of her daughters wrote describing the abuse. He has been charged with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Kindred became a grandfather-figure to the girls, now 16 and 17, when their mother started dating his son and they would have sleepovers at his house. That's when the molestation started, they say. Kindred told the victims that the 'devil was inside them' and that the sexual activity was the only cure. One of the girls said Kindred would driver her to her boyfriend's house, where she was not allowed to go by herself, and threaten to tell her mom about the visits if she refused sex with him. According to the complaint, the abuse included fondling, oral sex and rape and happened at Kindred's former residence in St Paul, a Target parking lot and his current home in Maplewood. When confronted with the accusations in August, Kindred admitted that the girls would come over for sleepovers but says he never touched them inappropriately. Kindred denied the allegations, saying the girls' mother made up the story because her new boyfriend doesn't like him. He ended the interview saying: 'And I'm gone...Get your warrants, do what you gotta do, no DNA, none of that...You weren't there, nobody was there!' When TwinCities.com reached out to the pastor today, he went even further to denounce the teens' report. Scene of the crime: Kindred's victims, now 16 and 17, say the abuse happened at his Maplewood home (above), his former residence in St Paul and a Target parking lot 'These are not really kids,' he said. 'They have a mind of the adult.' I never did anything like that,' Kindred added. 'Anyone can make up anything when you sit there long enough and you rehearse it.' He also called Minnesota a 'women's state' saying: 'All a woman has to do is make an accusation, true or false, and the man's going to be in trouble.'"

Earlier this year it was revealed that the BBC spent around £2.5million buying more than 4,000 iPhones, 400 iPads and 800 MacBooks for staff in the previous two years. Andy Silvester, campaign manager for the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: It's absolutely incredible that the BBC has run up a bill of this size teaching staff to use mainstream technology. The BBC spent around £2.5million buying more than 4,000 iPhones, 400 iPads and 800 MacBooks for staff i 'School teachers across the country know full well that teenagers can master an iPhone, so professionals should be able to. 'The BBC must cut out this kind of wasteful spending, or sympathy for the £145-a-year TV tax will continue to wane.' Presenters are regularly seen showing off their expensive Apple products on television - but the figures revealed thousands of off-screen staff are also getting hold of the gadgets. The Corporation have been buying iPhones at a rate of 200 a month for the last two years - shunning dozens of cheaper mobiles. In total, they bought 4,266 iPhones, 427 iPads and 815 MacBooks between January 2012 and October 2013, according to figures released to MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act. The number of iPads bought was relatively low because the BBC only started buying them for staff in December 2012 - and have been purchasing them at a rate of more than 40 a month since then, according to the latest full figures. The estimated cost of purchasing the Apple products is around £2.5million - based on standard retail prices although the BBC get a discount. However, the true cost of issuing staff with the gadgets will soar once the cost of mobile phone contracts with the Corporation's network operator O2 are taken into account. A spokesman for the BBC said that iPhones are only issued to staff who need them to do their jobs and they are not simply given out to all workers. They added: 'We are harnessing new technologies to train our journalists to use their phones to film, edit and transmit news stories on mobile phones. 'This not only keeps costs down for the licence fee payer but also increases our ability to work in remote places where there are no other means of broadcasting.'"

Federal investigators have said that the pickup truck left abandoned on railway tracks that caused the derailment of a Los Angeles-bound commuter train was not stuck at a railroad crossing. The truck caused a train crash that derailed three cars and sent 30 to hospital. Four people are in a critical condition, including the train's engineer. 'It was not stuck, it was not bottomed out on the track or something like that,' National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said at a media briefing late on Tuesday. 'We're very concerned about that, we're very interested in it,' he said, adding that both the badly wrecked truck's emergency brake and high-beams headlights were on. However a lawyer working for the driver of the truck claims that Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez did 'all he could' to free the vehicle from the tracks and then ran for help before the crash that injured dozens. Attorney Ron Bamieh told the  Ventura County Star that a preliminary investigation conducted by his firm showed the truck became entangled on the railroad tracks and 'somehow stuck' before the crash on Tuesday. Bamieh said that Sanchez-Ramirez accidentally drove onto the tracks and then made things worse by driving farther to try to get enough speed to get over the rails. Scroll down for video Three cars of the Southern California Metrolink commuter train derailed and tumbled onto their sides after the collision on tracks in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles Workers walk near a Metrolink train engine from a train that hit a truck and then derailed on Tuesday in Oxnard, California Bamieh says the Arizona man then tried pushing the vehicle before putting on his high beams and running for his life before impact. Police arrested Ramirez on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, but Bamieh said he went for help in Oxnard, about 65 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Sanchez-Ramirez was found about a half-mile away from the crash 45 minutes later, said Jason Benites, an assistant chief of the Oxnard Police Department. He's was briefly hospitalized before being arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run. Sanchez-Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Arizona, didn't call authorities because he was 'in shock' and didn't even realize he had a phone on him, Bamieh said. Ramirez only speaks Spanish, and two people he encountered could not understand him, the lawyer said. Police arrested Ramirez on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, but Bamieh said he went for help in Oxnard, about 65 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles Flames engulfed the driver's Ford F-450 pickup, but investigators said the engine was intact and may offer clues about what happened Federal investigators said preliminary reports countered remarks by officials immediately after the crash that the truck got stuck on the tracks. Police said they tested Sanchez-Ramirez for drugs and alcohol but would not discuss the results. Criminal records in his home state of Arizona show Sanchez-Ramirez pleaded guilty in 1998 to a host of violations in a single DUI case, including driving with a blood-alcohol content above .08 percent — the legal limit in the state — failure to obey a police officer, having liquor with a 'minor on the premises' and having no insurance, the Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday. In 2004, Ramirez was convicted of a local driving infraction in Yuma, and in 2007, he was cited for failure to obey a traffic control device. In the Tuesday crash, flames engulfed his Ford F-450 pickup, but investigators said the engine was intact and may offer clues about what happened. Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash that were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said The track also used by freight and Amtrak trains was restored to service around 9 a.m. on Wednesday, and commuter trains would begin rolling again in the evening, Metrolink said. Passenger Joel Bingham said many of those aboard the train on Tuesday were asleep and shocked awake when the loud boom first happened. 'It seemed like an eternity while we were flying around the train. Everything was flying,' Bingham said. 'A brush of death definitely came over me.' Eight people were admitted to the hospital of the 30 people originally examined, officials said. Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash that were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said. The four passenger cars remained largely intact, as did the locomotive. A firefighter crawls out of a passenger train car at the scene of a Metrolink accident, Tuesday,  in Oxnard, California The NTSB planned to examine the effectiveness of those cars, Sumwalt said. The train, the first of the morning on the Ventura route, had just left its second stop of Oxnard on its way to downtown Los Angeles when it struck the truck around 5:45 a.m. The engineer saw the abandoned vehicle and hit the brakes, but there wasn't enough time to stop, Oxnard Fire Battalion Chief Sergio Martinez said. The crossing has been the scene of many crashes over the years. After one killed 11 people and injured 180 others in Glendale in 2005, Metrolink invested heavily in passenger cars with collapsible bumpers and other features to absorb impact. Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said the Oxnard crash showed the technology worked. 'Safe to say it would have been much worse without it,' he said. Tuesday's crash happened on the same line as Metrolink's worst disaster, which left 25 people dead on Sept. 12, 2008. A commuter train engineer was texting and ran a red light, striking a Union Pacific freight train head-on in the San Fernando Valley community of Chatsworth.

The 68-year-old misplaced four items, including a Victorian diamond tiara, in a bag when she returned from London to Inveraray Castle. But when they were found by the British Airports Authority (BAA), they did not inform the police and simply sold them to a diamond merchant for just £5,000. The proceeds were given to charity as was standard procedure for property unclaimed within three months. In the meantime, the Duchess had reported the incident to the police and the Art Loss Register (ALR), which listed it on its database of stolen antiques, but it didn't unearth any leads. It was only earlier this year when she finally realised what had happened after spotting one of the pieces - a Cartier brooch in a catalogue of Scottish auction Lyon & Turnbull (L&T). The find was investigated by ALR's lawyer, Christopher Marinello, who discovered that the jewellery had actually resurfaced just months after it was lost and was sold for less than £5,000. Mr Marinello said: 'Apparently, the airport found the jewels or they were turned in to 'lost and found' by someone... The question remains: what did they do to help find the owner? 'They didn't call the police even though the airport police had a record of the theft. 'They didn't call ALR. The only thing they did was sell them.' Trying to make amends: The operators of Glasgow Airport has since offered to reimburse the diamond merchant in order for the tiara and brooch to be returned to her, although an emerald ring and pearl earrings are still missing He established the brooch was consigned to L&T by someone who bought it in good faith from the diamond merchant. The Duchess said: 'I'm absolutely amazed. I thought that after six years I'd lost them forever. 'The tiara was a Victorian family one and the necklace was given to me for my 21st birthday. So everything was very special.' The BAA has since offered to reimburse the diamond merchant in order for the tiara and brooch to be returned to her, although an emerald ring and pearl earrings are still missing. The Airport Authority says they no longer have records relating to the incident, but a spokesman said they would rethink their procedures as a result of the case.

Afghan murals show oil painting was going on for centuries earlier in Asia than Europe. Murals found on cave walls in Afghanistan prove that painting with oil had been going on in Asia for centuries before artists used the technique in Europe, scientists said this week. Until now, art historians believed that oil painting started in Europe in the 15th century. Scientists found the murals in a network of caves where monks lived and prayed in the Afghan region of Bamiyan, according to a statement on the Web site of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, where the ancient paintings were analyzed. Until 2001, two colossal 6th-century statues of Buddhas stood at the mouth of the caves. Then the Taliban, which then ruled Afghanistan, blew up the statues on the grounds that they were un-Islamic. The action drew international condemnation. Inside the caves, scientists found murals painted in the 7th century. They show images of Buddha in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures. In 12 of 50 caves, the murals were painted using drying oils -- perhaps from walnuts and poppy seeds -- the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility said. Its findings on the age of the oil paintings were published this week in The Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry. ""This is the earliest clear example of oil paintings in the world,"" said Yoko Taniguchi, leader of the team of scientists. Bamiyan, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) northwest of Kabul, was once a thriving center of commerce and Buddhism. The paintings, scientists say, were probably the work of artists who traveled along the Silk Road, the ancient trade route between China, across Central Asia's desert to the West. The Taliban used dozens of explosives to demolish the Buddha statues in Bamiyan. Museums and governments around the world had hoped to save the two Buddhas, the earliest of which is thought to have been carved into sandstone cliffs in the third century A.D. At heights of 53 meters and 36 meters, the statues were the tallest standing Buddhas in the world. Later in 2001, U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Now, the United Nations cultural agency, UNESCO, is trying to restore the bigger of the two statues. The task could take years. E-mail to a friend"

Coined the ‘red-button attack’ - named after the red button used on modern smart TV remotes to access additional content - the flaw can be exploited with just a $250 (£150) transmitter. In just minutes, someone using a smart TV could find their various internet accounts sending spam, printing coupons and writing fake reviews without their knowledge. Hackers could, in theory, also use these accounts to harvest personal information. Scroll down for video Scientists at Columbia University have revealed how modern hyrbrid smart TVs (stock image shown) are vulnerable to an attack that was not previously known. Dubbed the 'red button attack', hackers could hijack broadcasts to access a viewer's various connected internet accounts, including Facebook Yossi Oren and Angelos Keromytis from the Network Security Lab have outlined their research in a paper set to be released later this year. The hack is apparently remarkably easy to perform. Experts in London recently proved it's possible to use drones to steal data. They modified an aircraft capable of tapping into a phone's Wi-Fi settings. Once it had access, it was able to read and steal personal information. Called Snoopy, the drone takes advantage of smartphones that actively search for networks. From this it can also see networks those devices have accessed in the past. During tests, hackers exposed credit card information and passwords. According to Forbes, it would occur while someone is watching TV and would be over in just 12 minutes. The attack works by exploiting a vulnerability in Hybrid Broadcast-Broadband Television (HbbTV). This ‘allows broadcast streams to include embedded HTML content which is rendered by the television,’ the researchers wrote in their paper. ‘This system is already in very wide deployment in Europe, and has recently been adopted as part of the American digital television standard.’ The hacker would then, in essence, take over the channel a viewer was watching for a short amount of time. This would be done by using a simple amplifier, costing as little as £150 ($250) on a rooftop to hijack networks across an area of 0.5 square miles (1.4 square kilometres). Alternatively, a transmitter could also be placed on a drone, which could hover outside the windows of houses to hijack TVs. In doing so, the hacker would have access to any websites the viewer was logged into on their smart TV. This could range from getting access to their Facebook accounts to writing fake reviews on websites for products. The attack could be carried out by attaching a small and cheap transmitter to a drone (stock image shown) and then hovering outside a victim's window. The attackers could also set up a transmitter on a roof to potentially hijack tens of thousands of TVs across an entire city HbbTVs broadcasts can be hijacked because they are not linked to a web server, which also makes attacks virtually untraceable. ‘This enables a large-scale exploitation technique with a localised geographical footprint based on radio frequency (RF) injection,’ the researchers continue. This ‘requires a minimal budget and infrastructure and is remarkably difficult to detect.’ ‘In a dense urban area, an attacker with a budget of about $450 (£270) can target more than 20,000 devices in a single attack.’ There are a number of possible solutions. The most drastic includes cutting all internet access to smart TVs. Alternatively, broadcasters could begin to integrate smart TVs into a network that could see if they are being hijacked by monitoring for high spikes in signal strength. Perhaps the most simple solution, though, would be to have a confirmation box pop-up on screen when a viewer’s smart TV is trying to open an app such as Facebook. This, however, would detract from the current seamless and smooth integration between TV and internet favoured by companies at the moment. 'This potential attack method isn't related specifically to the use of the red button on a TV remote specifically, but to any interaction with a smart TV,' says David Emm, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab in Russia. 'Such an attack would effectively be a ""man in the middle"" attack, with hackers placing themselves between the consumer and the broadcaster and injecting their own, bogus information into the broadcast stream - for example, fake adverts and other content. 'After hacking the radio signal, hackers ""become the broadcaster"" and even have the ability to hack into anything sent or received by the consumer. 'One problem with such an attack is that, since it would involve hacking into the radio signal through the use of an antenna, it would be difficult to track down the attackers. 'It’s reminiscent of someone sniffing the traffic on a public Wi-Fi hotspot or setting up a fake one. 'Providers need to ensure they are considering such security implications of new technology. 'When new technologies emerge, the focus tends to be on the positive benefits - how the technology will make people's lives easier - not enough focus is placed on the risks inherent in the use of the latest technology. 'Smart fridges, garage doors, car entertainment systems and electricity meters are all examples of new technology that all benefit from Internet connectivity, but the extension of technology in this way also brings the possibility of more cyber-attacks.'"

Finishing full-time education and training at an older average age is the main reason why people are having their first child later in life, scientists said. Researchers from the University of Southampton looked at women in Britain and France to try and explain the fertility trend. Career-minded: Finishing full-time education and training at an older average age is the main reason why people are having their first child later in life Professor Maire Ni Bhrolchain, who conducted the study with Dr Eva Beaujouan, said: 'Later childbearing has been a major feature of fertility trends in recent decades, both in Britain and other developed countries. 'A large number of explanations have been suggested for the trend towards later parenthood, but our study is the first to show that the major influencing factor is that people have been staying on longer in education and training.' The average age of a woman having her first child in 2004 was 27, three years later than in 1974, when the average age was 24, the researchers said. During these three decades, young men and woman were progressively staying longer at school and also going into further and higher education in greater numbers - with women completing their education or training at an increasingly later age. In the late 1970s, young women were leaving full-time education or training at an average age of 18, but by 2004 this had risen by two years to an average age of 20. Professor Ni Bhrolchain said: 'The data we have examined shows that, in the past several decades, young people have been starting their full adult lives around two years later on average than in the recent past and this has meant family life starting later too.' The Southampton study focused on the period between the early 1980s and the late 1990s, during which time the mean age of women having their first birth rose by almost one-and-a-half years. During the same period, the time between women leaving full-time education and a first birth rose by only 0.6 years. This means that about three-fifths of the change in age at first birth in Britain is due to more time being spent in education and training. The figure is four-fifths in France. So longer education and training is the most important explanation for later childbearing, although not the only one. There are other contributory factors, the study claimed. Professor Ni Bhrolchain said: 'If we start the clock when young women leave full-time education or training, the delay to motherhood, compared across the decades, is much less than looking purely at the differences in their ages at their first birth.' To investigate the study, the researchers compiled and analysed data in Britain from the General Household Survey and in France from the Family History Survey. The study, called Fertility Postponement, is largely due to rising educational enrolment, is published in the journal Population Studies."

The 21ft, one-tonne saltwater crocodile, which was captured less than 18 months ago by a team of brave men in the southern Philippines, was found lying upside down in its enclosure in an eco-tourism park. Lolong, believed to be more than 50 years old, fell ill after swallowing a nylon cord about three weeks ago. He was left with nonstop diarrhoea, The Philippine Star reported. Lolong, named after a famed Philippines hunter, had been blamed for the deaths of several fishermen before its dramatic capture in the marshes near the town of Bunawan (population 35,000), 515 miles south east of Manila. Scroll down for video 'Lolong,' the largest saltwater crocodile in captivity has died at his home in Bunawan of Agusan Del Sur province, southern Philippines. Villagers are devastated at the loss Thirty men had spent three weeks trying to capture the huge reptile before they finally snared it in September 2011 using a dead pig as bait and throwing steel cables over it. A tractor was needed to haul it onto a trailer – but not before local people had crowded around the crocodile to pose for photos with their world-record catch. Since then, Lolong has been a star attraction at the tourism park and town councillors gleefully announced that their small town had finally found its place on the world map. But today many of the townsfolk were in tears on learning that Lolong had died within a year and a half of being moved to its new home. ‘We don’t know what happened to it,’ said the shocked Mayor, Edwin Elorde, who reportedly cradled the colossal creature in his arms before it died,. ‘Its death is a complete mystery and I have to admit that I’m really depressed. ‘I’ve come to love that crocodile. It brought fame and fortune to our town and, in a small way, to the Philippines.’ This September 2011 file picture shows the capture of Lolong. It was the largest crocodile in captivity, measuring 6.17 metres Prize catch: Villagers pose with newly-captured beast. it was hunted after a spate of attacks on humans and livestock, officials said Mr Elorde said that after the crocodile’s capture  - which made international headlines – a special eco-tourism park was created to house it. Local people and foreign tourists made special trips to the remote community to gaze in awe at the enormous creature. ‘We were planning to build a special road leading to the park because we were getting so many tourists, but now I’m not so sure whether we will proceed with it,’ said the Mayor. ‘Perhaps the plan will go ahead if we can catch more crocodiles – there are many more out there - but I can’t say whether they will have the same appeal as Lolong. ‘You only had to see him and you’d stand there staring as if under a spell.’ Colossus: Residents use their hands to measure Lolong, which is suspected of having attacked several people. It weighed 600 kg at the time of its capture Tourists from far and wide flocked to see Lolong in his purpose-built enclosure in the town When rangers at the park found Lolong floating on its back they called for immediate help from Mr Alex Collantes, a veterinarian who specialises in reptiles. He found that Lolong was still alive but close to death and as a desperate measure he and park rangers immersed it in lukewarm water. The region has been hit by unusually cold weather this month and Mr Collantes suggested this might have had something to do with the crocodile’s dire condition. Despite all efforts, however, Lolong was declared dead a few hours later. As word spread through the town, many people gathered in the streets and wept. Lolong in his enclosure. This picture gives an impression of the true scale of the enormous creature But Mayor Elorde said all was not lost – for there are now plans to have Lolong stuffed and put on display. ‘I think it might still attract people even in death because it is such an enormous creature,’ said Mr Elorde. ‘I think even the locals who have seen it when it was alive will come back – they aren’t going to let him slip from their memories, of that I’m sure.’ An autopsy is expected today to determine the cause of death."

In Arizona, the attorney general is proposing a change to state law that would allow an educator in each school to carry a gun. The moves to train teachers come after the National Rifle Association proposed placing an armed officer at each of the nation's schools, though some schools already have police officers. Parents and educators have questioned how safe the proposal would keep kids and whether it would be economically feasible. Some educators say it is dangerous to allow guns on campus.

Sig Sauer Among the potential dangers they point to are teachers being overpowered for their weapons or students getting them and accidentally or purposely shooting classmates. ‘It's a terrible idea,’ said Carol Lear, a chief lawyer for the Utah Office of Education. ‘It's a horrible, terrible, no-good, rotten idea.’ Kristen Rand, the legislative director for the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy organization, said to believe that a 'teacher would be successful in stopping someone who has made the decision to engage in a shootout is just not rationale. 'No teacher is ever going to be as effective as a trained law enforcement officer,' Rand said. Even trained police officers don't always hit their targets, and arming teachers could put innocent students at risk of crossfire, she said. Big audience: 200 Utah teachers listen during the concealed weapons training class Free training: The Utah Shooting Sports Council said it would waive its $50 fee for the concealed weapons training session for Utah teachers Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act more quickly than law enforcement in the critical first few minutes to protect children from the kind of deadly shooting that took place in Connecticut. They emphasized the importance of reacting appropriately under pressure. ‘We're not suggesting that teachers roam the halls’ looking for an armed intruder, said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's biggest gun lobby. ‘They should lock down the classroom. But a gun is one more option if the shooter’ breaks into a classroom, he said. The group waived its $50 fee for the training. Instruction featured plastic guns and emphasized that people facing deadly threats should announce or show their gun and take cover before trying to shoot. They cautioned teachers about the liability that comes with packing a gun in public.‘It's going to be a hassle. It's another responsibility. You can't just leave your gun lying around,’ Aposhian said. ‘Not for a minute.’ Onlookers: Carl Stubbs, center, the principal from Valley View Elementary School, in Pleasant Grove, Utah, looks on with other teachers during the training session New permit holder: Stephen Pratt, a third grade teacher from Alpine, Utah, is fingerprinted for a gun carry permit during the concealed weapons training session The teachers at the basic gun training applied for a concealed-weapons permit, submitting fingerprints and a mug shot for a criminal background check. The class kicked off as an instructor in the ‘psychology of mass violence’ offered various tactics to disrupt an assailant. The first, the instructor said, was to start with the command: ‘Stop right there!’ ‘I wouldn't hesitate to shoot if the danger was immediate,’ said Fiveash, adding that her laser sight would make shooting in tight quarters safer. English teacher Kevin Leatherbarrow said he often felt threatened while working at an inner-city school in Buffalo, N.Y., where he got a license to carry a pistol. He moved less than a year ago to Utah, where he feels safer. But he said gun violence can break out anywhere.

Utah is among a few states that let people carry licensed concealed weapons into public schools without exception, the National Conference of State Legislatures says in a 2012 compendium of state gun laws. Utah educators say they would ban guns if they could, but legislators left them with no choice. State law forbids schools, districts or college campuses from imposing their own gun restrictions. Educators say they have no way of knowing how many teachers are armed. Gun-rights advocates estimate 1 per cent of Utah teachers, or 240, are licensed to carry concealed weapons. It's not known how many do so at school. ‘I never felt threatened in 14 years of teaching, but I don't think you can be too prepared,’ said Tiffany Parry, a dance teacher in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy who applied for Thursday for a license to carry a concealed gun. ‘I think it could come in handy.’ Self-defense training: David Burnell, CEO of OPSGEAR teaches self-defense as part of the training class Demonstration: Aposhian demonstrates with a plastic gun during the concealed weapons training session for the 200 Utah teachers"

The National House Building Council (NHBC), which released the figures, said detached homes are making a 'comeback', with 38,113 new build properties of this type registered with it in 2014, which is the highest number recorded for any year since 2004. Across all types of property, 145,174 new homes across the UK were registered with the NHBC last year, marking a 9 per cent increase on 2013 and the highest annual total since 2007 as the economic recovery continues. New home owners are snapping up detached houses according to new figures released today, file picture Almost 40,000 new detached homes were registered with the National House Building Council last year Yorkshire and the Humber, Wales, Northern Ireland, the West Midlands and the South East are all now outpacing London in terms of the year-on-year percentage growth in the number of new builds being registered. Wales recorded the strongest percentage jump, with registrations up by one third (33 per cent) on 2013. The NHBC said London saw 'exceptional' growth in the number of new builds being registered in 2013, and in 2014 growth in the capital was more in line with that seen in the UK generally. With 28,733 new homes registered in London last year, the number of new builds recorded in the capital was still up by 10 per cent on 2013. Eastern England was the only UK region that recorded a year-on-year fall in new build registrations in 2014, with a 6 per cent fall. The NHBC's registration figures are taken from builders who are responsible for around 80 per cent of homes constructed in the UK. Builders are required to register a house with the NHBC before starting work, which means its figures represent homes that are to be built in the months ahead. The number of detached homes being registered represents a 24 per cent increase on 2013. Detached homes now make up more than one quarter (26 per cent) of all homes being built, with flats and maisonettes still accounting for the biggest chunk of new builds, at one third (33 per cent). In 2008, almost half (49 per cent) of new build homes being registered were flats, while just 15 per cent were detached homes. NHBC chief executive Mike Quinton said: 'It looks like the detached home is making a comeback ... Following an oversupply of flats outside London over the last decade, the growth in detached homes is restoring balance to the country's housing stock.' Some 48,685 flats were registered with the NHBC last year - representing a 5 per cent increase on 2013 but just over half of the 90,221 flats that were recorded during the boom in 2007. The number of new build semi-detached homes also increased on 2013, rising by 12 per cent to 31,650. Meanwhile, the number of bungalows and terraced homes being registered fell year-on-year. Some 26,600 terraced homes were registered in 2014, representing a 2 per cent annual fall, while 2,059 bungalows were registered, showing a 16 per cent decrease. Despite the boost in new build numbers, the NHBC said that 2014's total remains below the average of 153,000 registrations seen per year over the last four decades. Mr Quinton continued: 'We are still building below the levels seen before the economic downturn and below what this country needs. 'With the general election just three months away, it is therefore very encouraging that housing remains a top priority for all the main parties.' Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'Today's figures clearly show how our efforts have got the country building again ... 'We have turned around a broken housing market, including introducing schemes like Help to Buy to help home owners get on the housing ladder and investing billions in affordable housebuilding.' The National House Building Council said the increase in demand for detached housing was addressing a problem with the oversupply of new apartments especially outside the London area"

Madrid are due to fly out to Morocco on December 14 for the seven-team tournament that could see them win their fourth trophy of the year but there are real concerns that their season will be derailed by serious injury to top players because of the state of the pitch at Rabat where they play their semi-final on December 16 against the winner of Cruz Azul from Mexico and Western Sydney Wanderers. Real ‘signed’ Burgess from Arsenal in 2009 after he had excelled in the Premier League and Madrid saw him as the cure for on-going problems with their own Santiago Bernabeu pitch. Real Madrid are concerned their players could pick up injuries playing on poor quality pitches He has produced the perfect playing surface in Madrid for Manuel Pellegrini, Jose Mourinho and now Carlo Ancelotti but he also inspects the pitches Madrid have to play on beyond Spanish borders. Burgess visited the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium which is home to FAR Rabat at the end of October and returned and was not impressed with what he saw. The venue will host the first three matches of the tournament and then Madrid’s semi-final. Burgess is over-seeing urgent repair work on the playing surface which Real’s potential rivals in the World Club Cup final, San Lorenzo, will not have to play on because they play their semi-final in Marrakech where the final will also be held. Burgess was responsible for the immaculate pitch at Highbury before moving to Spain to join Real Madrid On Burgess’ advice Madrid have asked Fifa to allow them to arrive just two days before they play their first game in Morocco enabling them to fit another training session in at their own Valdebebas training ground and not in Rabat. It is not unusual for Burgess to inspect conditions before Real Madrid have to play – he also flies to the United States ahead of pre-season tours to check facilities and pitch standards. The three-times winner of the Premier League Groundsman of the year award at Arsenal joined the Gunners in 1996 as an 18-year-old after starting his career at Blackpool. He took over as head groundsman of Arsenal’s former home Highbury four years later before Madrid swooped in 2009.

The family, in a statement released Tuesday, sought to distance itself from Henke Pistorius, Oscar's father, who said that some of the guns are for protection from crime -- protection he said the African National Congress government is not providing. The family's statement also was at odds with one by Oscar Pistorius, who told the magistrate who granted him bond that he kept the handgun that killed his girlfriend at his bed because he's ""been a victim of violence and of burglaries."" Opinion: Why brutality is ingrained in psyche of South Africa The ""Pistorius family own weapons purely for sport and hunting purposes,"" the Olympic icon's family said in the statement provided by a spokesman. Beeld, an Afrikaans language newspaper, has reported the Pistorius family owns 55 weapons -- between his father, grandfather and two uncles -- not counting Oscar's six guns. The family's statement came in response to a controversy triggered when Henke Pistorius defended the arsenal by telling a UK newspaper that white South Africans need guns for self-defense because the ANC, which gained control in 1994 with the collapse of South Africa's apartheid system, does a poor job of protecting them. ""Some of the guns are for hunting and some are for protection, the hand guns,"" Henke Pistorius is quoted as telling a Telegraph reporter. ""It speaks to the ANC government -- look at white crime levels, why protection is so poor in this country, it's an aspect of our society."" While he said he's never used any of his four firearms -- two rifles and two handguns -- for self-defense, ""that doesn't mean I haven't been hijacked, attacked."" ""As a family, we value life much too much to produce guns at every opportunity we can use them,"" Henke Pistorius told the Telegraph. ""I have been in positions where I can use a gun but we have been brought up in a way that we value the lives of others very highly."" The ANC immediately attacked Henke Pistorius, saying his statement was not only ""devoid of truth, it is also racist."" ""It is sad that he has chosen to politicize a tragic incident that is still fresh in the minds of those affected and the public,"" ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu said. ""This tragic incident has affected two families that are still trying to come to terms with what happened and this latest racist slur is not assisting these families. We think it is ill-advisable for anyone to start apportioning undue blame."" Oscar Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder in the death of his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp. Prosecutors say the Olympian killed Steenkamp, 29, after a heated argument in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day. The double-amputee sprinter, known as the ""Blade Runner,"" submitted a sworn affidavit to the judge considering his bail request last month saying he kept a 9 mm pistol ""underneath my bed when I went to bed at night"" because he was ""acutely aware of violent crime being committed by intruders entering homes with a view to commit crime, including violent crime."" ""I have received death threats before,"" the affidavit said. ""I have also been a victim of violence and of burglaries before."" The magistrate granted bail, allowing Pistorius to go free eight days after the shooting. The Pistorius family, which hired a ""reputation management"" firm to help with media relations, issued a statement Monday saying, ""Oscar and the rest of the Pistorius family distances itself"" from Henke Pistorius' comments. ""Henke's interview with the newspaper was unapproved by our media liaison team,"" family spokesman Arnold Pistorius, Henke's brother, said. ""The comment doesn't represent the views of Oscar or the rest of the Pistorius family."" Another political party -- the Young Communist League of South Africa -- weighed in on what it called ""reckless remarks."" ""It is actually believed by most South Africans that the wealthy, mostly white people receive preferential treatment and it is for this reason that the Young Communist League cannot take seriously the claims made by Henke Pistorius,"" the party said.

Instruments on The European Space Agency's (ESA) flagship observatory have warmed to levels that mean it is now 'blind'. The demise of Herschel was expected by astronomers as stores of liquid helium that are vital to keeping the temperature close to absolute zero have finally been exhausted. The Herschel space observatory, pictured over a background image of Vela C star-forming region, has stopped working after three years observing the coolest regions of the Universe Herschel took thousands of images, including this magnificent picture of the Andromeda galaxy After 35,000 scientific observations, ESA staff say Herschel has left behind a 'treasure trove of data'. The pioneering observatory was launched in May, 2009, and studied the origin and evolution of stars and galaxies in a mission to discover how the Universe came to be. At the time of its launch, Herschel held 2,300 litres of liquid helium but that has slowly been evaporating over the past three years. Astronomers confirmed it had finally run out at the start of the spacecraft's daily communication with the ground station in Western Australia. The timing of its demise was accurately predicted by experts. Professor Alvaro Giménez Cañete, ESA’s director of Science and Robotic Exploration, said: 'Herschel has exceeded all expectations, providing us with an incredible treasure trove of data that that will keep astronomers busy for many years to come.' The Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy in infrared light seen by the Herschel Space Observatory An infrared image of the Orion nebula highlighting fledgling stars hidden in gas and clouds The space observatory amassed more than 25,000 hours of data from 600 observing programmes. The telescope was launched from French Guiana in May, 2009. Weighs 3.3 tonnes and its lifespan was 11 months longer than originally predicted. Its primary mirror is one and a half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope. Made 35,000 scientific observations and amassed more than 25,000 hours of data. The space observatory will be sent into permanent orbit around the Sun. Herschel is named after Sir William Herschel, the discoverer of the infrared spectrum and planet Uranus, and his sister and collaborator Caroline Herschel. Herschel carried the largest and most powerful infrared telescope ever flown in space and its  primary mirror was 3.5metres in diameter - one and a half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope. Its telescope captured thousands of images of star-forming regions and was able to shine through obstacles that block visible light. Göran Pilbratt, ESA’s Herschel Project scientist, said the telescope had given new insight into the secret workings of the Universe. He said: 'Herschel has offered us a new view of the hitherto hidden Universe, pointing us to a previously unseen process of star birth and galaxy formation, and allowing us to trace water through the Universe from molecular clouds to newborn stars and their planet-forming discs and belts of comets.' Thomas Passvogel, ESA’s Herschel Programme manager, added: 'Herschel’s ground-breaking scientific haul is in no little part down to the excellent work done by European industry, institutions and academia in developing, building and operating the observatory and its instruments.' In a demonstration of Herschel's work, the ESA released images taken of the Andromeda galaxy showing cool lanes of forming stars in the finest detail yet. The unparalleled power of its infrared telescope meant it could capture infrared light from some of the coolest areas of the Universe, allowing astronomers a glimpse of these regions for the first time. The satellite, which is currently 1.5million km from Earth, will be propelled into an orbit of the Sun, where it will remain indefinitely. The billion-euro observatory will now be sent into orbit around the Sun, where it will remain indefinitely"

The ornate pure gold 2oz bracelet with an enamel picture of the Thai royal family was given to Nadia Yerusalimsky in around 1912 by the then King Vajiravudh - King Rama VI. It is thought the dancer bewitched His Majesty when she performed at the palace after moving to Bangkok with her father who was a tailor.

The real-life story imitates the film, based on the 1944 novel Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon, starring Yul Brynner as the king who falls for a Victorian governess played by Deborah Kerr. But unlike the film, Ms Yerusalimsky went on to marry another man, Welshman Henry Hopkin in Bangkok in 1916. Now their grandchildren are putting up the historic piece of jewellery for auction on November 1. Bewitched by dancer: The King of Siam gave the bracelet to Nadia Yerusalimsky (left with unidentified dancer) in about 1912 after she performed at the palace in Bangkok For sale: The pure gold 2oz bracelet, which features this enamel picture, is now going under the hammer as the dancer's grandchildren put it up for sale at auction on November 1 Auctioneer Thomas Plant, from Special Auction Services, Berkshire, said: ‘Although this has great value because it is almost completely pure gold, if not 99.9 percent, it's the history and romance behind it that is the real story. ‘King Rama VI was the grandson and the king who many think was the inspiration for the film and book the 'King and I' ‘And with this gift to Nadia it was in many ways a case of history repeating itself as it appears this king was very fond of her. ‘I don't think would have happened after the time of the Great War, this was a more innocent time. Pure gold: The bracelet has seven gold bullet coins from the time of Rama V, King Chulalongkorn in the 1870s and is expected to fetch £8,000 at auction ‘Nadia actually went on to marry a rather naughty Welshman Henry Hopkin who had fled to Bangkok after having an affair with the village policeman's wife. ‘Henry, from Wales, and Nadia, from Russia, were married in Bangkok in 1916 and went on to have two children together.’ The bracelet features seven gold bullet coins from the time of Rama V , King Chulalongkorn, in the 1870s with two impressed strike marks, one for Chakra, the other possibly for Rama V, joined by oval links. A circular medallion with enamel design for the Siamese Royal family is then joined to it by a later loop clasp.

Richard Knight, 28, told a court his 'phobia' of the insects caused him to swerve across a lane at 70mph on the M3 because he 'didn't want to be stung'. But magistrates rejected his excuse and handed him an 18-month driving ban. Anne Bater, 68, died after the crash on the M3 in Basingstoke in may this year His VW Golf hit a Honda Jazz which careered off the motorway in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and landed on its roof killing 68-year-old Anne Bater. Her husband Keith, who was a passenger, survived with a back injury but told Basingstoke Magistrates' Court he has been left 'bereft' by the loss of his wife. Knight, from Aldershot, said he was in the outside lane of the motorway when he noticed a wasp flying near his right ear. He said he wound the driver's window down, but it remained in the car and distracted him. Knight said as he tried to put the passenger side window down he veered into the middle lane, hitting Mrs Bater's car. The court heard that psychiatric tests later revealed Knight had a phobia of winged insects that can sting. Asked how he felt when he saw the wasp in his car, he told magistrates: 'I was very anxious and worried. 'I obviously did not want to be stung, and my instinct was just to get it out of the car.' Richard Knight was given an 18-month driving ban at Basingstoke Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to causing death by careless driving James Burnham, prosecuting, said Knight's 'special reason' application to avoid a driving ban should be ignored. Mr Burnham said Knight should have safely pulled over to the hard shoulder to let the wasp out. He also read out victim impact statements from Mrs Bater's husband and their two daughters, who were all in court. Mr Bater said in his statement: 'I never knew the true meaning of the word bereft but that's how I feel now. Our house is empty and I'm very lonely.' Mrs Bater, from High Wycombe, Bucks, was pronounced dead at Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital after the crash in May this year. Matthew Kerruish-Jones, defending, said Knight - who pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving - had shown genuine remorse about the crash. Knight's 'special reason' application was rejected by residing magistrate Roy Cleave, who said he could have taken other actions to avoid the accident. Mr Cleave handed Knight an 18-month driving ban and gave him an 18-month community order with 200 hours unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £85 in costs."

Jerry Hause, 61, and his 26-year-old son Jeffrey were out on a hunt Monday when he decided to sit down to rest for a minute. That's when he saw the black bear coming at him at a dead run. 'I stood up and in one motion that bear jumped out of the creek it was in and was on level ground with me,' Hause, of Longview, told The Daily News. 'And as soon as it was on level ground it was on a dead run after me.' Jerry Hause is an avid outdoorsman, but running away from a black bear was a first for him A few days before Jerry Hause was bit by a black bear, his son captured this image of what appears to be the beast that bit him Hause is an avid outdoorsman who's been hunting for decades — but having started bow hunting just four years ago, he didn't think he'd have time and the skills to pick up his bow and shoot the charging bear. Instead, he scrambled up a tree while the animal, which appeared to be 250 to 300 pounds, closed in on him. 'I knew the tree was right there, so I headed up that to get far enough up the tree that the bear couldn’t get me,' Hause told The Daily News. He thought he was out of the bear's reach. He was wrong. 'It totally amazes me how fast that bear got on me,' Hause he told the newspaper. 'In three seconds it was on me.' The black bear bit and clawed against the hunter's left leg — and didn't let go until Hause kicked it in the snout with his right foot. 'I was thinking, ""If it gets me out of this tree I’m a dead man,""' he told The Daily News. 'It was mad, it was growling, it was serious about what it was going to do.' But amazingly, the bear let go after the kick, dropped to the ground and moved on. Hause waited around for a while and was eventually able to walk out and call for help. He was treated for puncture wounds and claw scratches at a hospital and is recovering at home. Wildlife experts say black bears usually run away when they hear people. This unusual level of aggression indicates the bear may have been a mother protecting its cubs. Local officials planned on euthanizing the bear — but Hause convinced them otherwise because of the likelihood it was a just a frightened animal acting our of motherly instincts. 'It either had cubs out there or I was threatening its food,' he told The Daily News. 'It’s bear country. They live in the woods. I don’t.' For his part, Hause has learned his lesson: next time he goes bow hunting, he plans to carry a pistol. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."

Independent schools are having to invest in staff and facilities to attract a ‘global middle-class’ and compete with schools in the US and Australia that are aiming for the same market. But the trend means British families must meet the higher fees that those from China and other boom economies are prepared to pay, private school leaders warn. Etonians at School: As school fees continue to rise, middle-classes could be squeezed out of places like Eton William Richardson, the general secretary of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, said: ‘The global middle-class is absolutely vast, as is the money they generate.’ Research has already shown that average fees have risen four-fold in a little over 20 years, leaving private education increasingly unaffordable for parents in traditionally well-paid careers such as law and accountancy. Heads’ leaders have revealed that part of the problem is the cost of competing globally. They also said schools were handing out increasing amounts in means-tested bursaries to help Britain’s ‘squeezed middle’. In some, families with incomes of up to £65,000 qualify for help. The trends emerged at the annual meeting of the HMC, representing 260 leading schools including Eton and Harrow. In some, families with incomes of up to £65,000 qualify for help.The trends emerged at the annual meeting of the HMC, representing 260 leading schools including Eton and Harrow Although some schools continued to serve mainly local families, others were targeting the global and domestic market. Mr Richardson said these operated increasingly in an ‘international environment with all the resources that entails’, adding: ‘For my money, this is a 20-year trend that I just don’t see slowing down at all.’ He said day school headmasters would recruit pupils in the Far East who might come to this country to live with extended family. Richard Harman, the headmaster of £32,850-a-year Uppingham School (above), said: ‘The costs of excellence in education are high, and to provide world-class education you have to put the resources into it’ Chairman Richard Harman, the headmaster of £32,850-a-year Uppingham School, told the meeting in Newport, South Wales: ‘The costs of excellence in education are high, and to provide world-class education you have to put the resources into it.’ He added: ‘Apart from parents in the UK who are making real sacrifices to send their children to our schools, there are parents from Azerbaijan to Germany to China looking to get the best education for their child in this country.’ A study this year said parents in accountancy, law, finance and academia were less likely to afford an independent education than plumbers were in 1990. Average annual day fees had more than quadrupled since 1990, from £2,985 to £12,700. Boarding soared from £6,800 to £28,800. A separate study by Lloyds on costs in 2009 and 2014 found fees up 21 per cent, while average incomes had risen by 5 per cent. Mr Harman said HMC schools now spent £365million a year on means-tested bursaries."

A street in Havering, the London borough where the family who have received £250,000 are reported to live A spokeswoman for Havering Council confirmed that the family are still on the scheme, meaning their issues are still not resolved. The family, which is believed to have several children, has sucked in £100,000 more than the average household on the scheme and more than three times the £72,696 a normal law abiding UK family can expect to earn during the same two-year period. The scheme, introduced after the 2011 riots, aims at getting households struggling with drug, crime and behavioural issues back on the straight and narrow but can, so far, only boast a nine per cent success rate.

Professor Dame Sally Davies also described homeopaths as ‘peddlers’ and spoke of her concern that they can prescribe pills and potions to treat malaria and other illnesses. Giving evidence to an influential committee of MPs, Dame Sally said that homeopathy doesn’t work past the placebo effect. Civil servants watered down an article on the NHS Choices website that had warned there was no evidence that homeopathic remedies work In other words, any benefits patients perceive are simply caused by them receiving attention and simply expecting to feel better. Her outspoken views are in conflict with the policy of the Health Service, which spends around £4million a year on funding homeopathic hospitals and on prescriptions and referrals. Homeopathy, which has the backing of Prince Charles, claims to prevent and treat diseases using diluted forms of plants, herbs and minerals. It is based on the principle that an illness can be treated by substances that produce similar symptoms. Outspoken medic Professor Dame Sally Davies, left, has described homeopathy as 'rubbish' despite the fact it has been endorsed by high profile figures such as Prince Charles, right For example, it is claimed onions, which make eyes itchy and tearful, can be used to relieve the symptoms of hay fever. Other treatments include anti-malaria tablets made from African swamp water, rotting plants and mosquito eggs and larvae. But scientists argue the ‘cures’ are so diluted they are unlikely to contain any of the original substance. Asked about her views on homeopathy by the Commons science and technology committee, Dame Sally – a consultant haematologist, or specialist in blood diseases, at the Central Middlesex Hospital from 1985 until 2011 – said: ‘I’m very concerned when homeopathic practitioners try to peddle this way of life to prevent malaria or other infectious diseases.’ She added: ‘I am perpetually surprised that homeopathy is available on the NHS.’ Dame Sally concluded by saying homeopathy ‘is rubbish’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has endorsed homeopathy. In 2007, while shadow minister for the disabled, he signed an early day motion backing its use on the NHS. Fifteen per cent of Britons have used homeopathy at some point in their lives. The exact amount of NHS spending on the discipline is unclear but various homeopathic associations say it is as high as £4million a year. The Department of Health said it is up to local NHS organisations to decide whether to fund it."

The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the gadgets Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the new gadgets. The 4.7-inch iPhone is expected to go into production next week, with the larger 5.5inch version set to start three weeks later. Apple has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens, and its devices typically have a 4-inch display. By increasing the size of its iPhone 6 handsets, Apple phones will be closer in size to those made by rival Samsung and HTC. Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal display. Current models have a separate touchscreen layer. Elsewhere, the 5.5-inch iPhone screen is expected to be made of sapphire crystal, rather than glass. Due to the complex nature of these screens, reports claim Apple could even ask component makers to prepare for 120 million displays, to account for any faults and replacements that need to be issued. The Economic Daily said earlier this week Foxconn finally confirmed the rumours it would hire a huge number of staff. The report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger 'phablet' sized iPhone 6 won't ship until 2015. This figure is up from 60 million for the iPhone 5S (pictured) and 5C last year.

Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres). A YouTube videomaker recently claimed to have acquired one of the sapphire screens - and has subjected it to a barrage of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting it. In the video, the screen emerges totally unscathed, raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from Apple. Marques Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claims to have got the screen from well known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video showcasing the screen. In the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen. 'I slowly realised there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' he said. 'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.' The glass is also extremely high-quality, Brownlee noted: 'There’s absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass.'

Isabelle, known as Issy, was 14 at the time. She has severe autism and sometimes has violent outbursts. Stapleton's blog had chronicled the challenges her family faced while caring for her. In July, Stapleton's estranged husband, Matt Stapleton, said he will never be able to forgive his wife for attempting to kill their now 15-year-old daughter. Mr Stapleton, from Elberta, said that raising Issy was hard and at one point brought the couple to 'a cracking point,' but that no parent of an autistic child should ever take such extreme measures. 'Kelli did something unspeakable,' he told People magazine. Issy was diagnosed as autistic at two years old, and barely slept until the age of eight when she began taking medication that gave her focus and allowed her parents to rest. However, when she became violent towards her classmates her parents were forced to pull her out of school, 'just for the safety of the other kids,' Mr Stapleton said during an interview last month.

The family finally got Issy into a residential autism treatment center in January 2013. The program made the teenager calmer and was helping to teach her how to control her fiery temper. Issy attended the Great Lake Center for Autism Treatment in Potage for seven months. Mrs Stapleton acted just days after Issy was released. She allegedly told her daughter they were going on a camping trip and then lit two charcoal grills in the van they were in with the windows up. Both survived after being found unconscious. After 17 years of marriage, Mr Stapleton filed for divorce, partly to show a welfare agency how he's determined to protect Issy and his two other children.

His appearance had been ordered by Pakistan's High Court, which on Thursday ruled that his alleged actions amounted to an act of terrorism. After a 20-minute hearing, the anti-terrorism court in Islamabad placed Musharraf on judicial remand for 14 days. His next court appearance in the case is set for May 4. As the former president left the court, there were clashes between anti-Musharraf lawyers and a small pro-Musharraf crowd. Authorities decided Musharraf will be held under house arrest at his farmhouse compound in Chak Shazad, outside the Pakistani capital. He will be moved from police headquarters, where he was whisked after his court appearance, to the farmhouse, police officials said. The farmhouse has been converted into a ""sub jail,"" Musharraf's lawyer, Ahmed Raza Qasoori, said Friday. Musharraf spent Friday night at police headquarters following his appearance before a magistrate earlier in the day, after which he was initially allowed to return to the farmhouse. Musharraf will continue to seek bail in the case, his lawyer said. An attempt on Thursday to appeal the High Court's decision at the Supreme Court appeared to have so far been unsuccessful. The former president denies the charges against him and never gave any order to detain or abduct the judges in 2007, said Mohammad Amjad, a spokesman for his political party. The development is the latest setback for Musharraf since the former military ruler returned to Pakistan last month to fight a series of court cases against him and re-enter the country's turbulent political scene by seeking to run in upcoming elections. His arrest highlights the increased willingness of Pakistan's judiciary, which clashed with Musharraf during his time in power, to pursue cases against high-profile figures previously considered to be untouchable. No former Pakistani army chief has previously been arrested and detained. Amid a long-running fight with the judiciary, Musharraf resigned as president of Pakistan in 2008 after nine years in power and went into exile the following year, living in London and Dubai. He came back to Pakistan last month under heavy security. But so far, his return does not seem to be going according to plan. Last week, Pakistani election officials barred him from running for a seat in parliament in elections next month, a decision his lawyer has said he will challenge. The ex-military strongman still has to face two separate other cases dating from his time in power. The first relates to claims he did not do enough to protect the life of Benazir Bhutto -- the first woman to be elected prime minister of Pakistan -- after she was assassinated in 2007, weeks before an election in which she hoped to return to office. Musharraf is also accused of ordering his troops to kill Nawab Akbar Bugti, a popular tribal leader, in the volatile province of Balochistan, in 2006. CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Islamabad and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Aliza Kassim, Nasir Habib and Shaan Khan contributed to this report."

The Manchester United striker was one of four Dutch players practising spot-kicks at end of a session open to fans at AZ Alkmaar’s AFAS Stadium but crashed his shot against the post with Louis Van Gaal watching on. There was a shake of the head, a tussle for the ball with Nigel De Jong, then a successful strike from 12 yards by Van Persie to put him in a positive frame of mind ahead of the heightened pressure to come. Not allowing that to happen! Robin van Persie wouldn't leave Holland training without scoring a penalty What was that? The Man United striker smashed an effort against the bar with Louis van Gaal watching Hitting the woodwork at the World Cup is a rather different affair to this send-off in front of 5,000 or so Dutch supporters happy to cheer and clap. There is a friendly against Wales in Amsterdam on Wednesday night first, before the flight to Rio on Thursday, but this was a chance to give the Dutch public a glimpse of what they can expect across the Atlantic. Van Gaal’s likely starting XI engaged in a game of eight versus three to stretch the defence in a manner similar to how Spain might. The teams face each other in their opening World Cup game on June 13. Aston Villa’s Ron Vlaar and Stefan De Vrij, of Feyenoord, were pulled one way then the other by Van Persie, Wesley Sneijder, Arjen Robben and company (including Norwich City’s Leroy Fer) in a crowd-pleasing drill that saw plenty of goals. Van Gaal, on his way to Manchester United once the tournament is over, will deploy a 5-3-2 system in Brazil with attacking wing-backs in Daryl Janmaat and Daley Blind.

Daley Blind (left), Fer and Bruno Martins Indi on Tuesday Means business: Van Persie stared straight down the lens for his official photograph In a quick passing routine the national captain looked sharp and well over his injury that restricted his playing time under David Moyes. He will just hope there are no further penalty blemishes. Meanwhile, Van Gaal believes he has a happy camp as the World Cup draws near - and he intends to keep it that way by winning. The Dutch may have a reputation for attractive football but some of their previous tournament challenges have been undermined by infighting within the squad. Van Gaal experienced such disharmony himself during his first unsuccessful stint as national boss, when Holland failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. The 62-year-old is not sensing any problems this time round as his squad prepare to fly to Brazil on Thursday and he feels he has a duty to make sure that remains the case. Van Gaal, who will take over as Manchester United manager after the World Cup, said: ‘It’s also dependent on the management, it is not only the players. I think it is about the relationship between a manager and his squad. ‘In my first episode there was that (disruption) but I have understood now. They like me now. ‘I feel there are not any problems. We have a very good relationship. ‘But it is also dependent on the results. At this moment we don’t lose so much.’ Hello!

It is only the second known case of a patient developing synesthesia after a stroke. The neurological condition causes the stimulation of a sense, such as hearing music, to lead to automatic, involuntary experiences in a different sense, such as seeing colours or tasting a flavour. A stroke patient has developed synesthesia, a neurological condition that causes the brain to confuse senses, several months after a stroke. When listening to high-pitched voices or brass instruments - often when listening to James Bond themes -  he would experience 'orgasmic sensations' After a stroke in 2007, the unnamed 45-year-old man from Toronto noticed that words printed in a particular shade of blue disgusted him, according to a report by National Post. He then became aware that the sound of high-pitched voices and brass instruments — specifically, the theme music from James Bond films — triggered out-of-body, orgasmic sensations and blue flashes of light in his vision. He said he felt as if ‘he could ride the music’. The Toronto St. Michael’s Hospital patient specifically recalled a moment when he watched the Beijing Olympics. Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight. Another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, colour or flavour. Around four per cent of people are thought to have the condition which is eight times more common in women. Most synesthesists tend to be left-handed. There are no dangerous side-effects to the having the condition Famous synesthesists include Marilyn Monroe, Mary J Blige as well as the artists Kandinsky and Hockney. He said when a woman sang at the opening ceremony it triggered an overwhelming and frightening reaction. He said: ‘I had the sensation of entering the TV, and entering the stadium and I was floating above the crowd. I could feel the heat and humidity coming off the people. I could feel it on my skin. ‘It scared the hell out of me. I thought, ""this is how you lose your mind"". I was convinced I was going to go crazy.’ He was eventually referred to his Dr Luis Fornazarri, a behavioural neurologist, who instantly diagnosed him with synaesthesia. Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense is simultaneously perceived as another - a person tastes sounds or feels colours. Around four per cent of people are thought to have the condition, which is eight times more common in women. Most synesthesists tend to be left-handed. There are no dangerous side-effects to the having the condition Famous synesthesists include Marilyn Monroe, Mary J Blige as well as the artists Kandinsky and Hockney. Feeling blue: The man first became concerned because he became addicted to raspberries after he said they tasted of a certain shade of blue. However seeing sky blue suddenly left him feeling disgusted Other symptoms exhibited by the man include an insatiable hunger for raspberries because they taste of a 'certain shade of blue'. The patient's stroke occurred in his thalamus -  the area of the brain responsible for processing sensory information. Experts say the process of repair after the stroke caused the brain to 'miswire', connecting areas of the brain that once never came into contact with each other. The only other reported case of synesthesia following a stroke is a 35-year-old U.S. woman who experienced tingling in her body when she heard certain sounds. Since the male patient's diagnosis, he has learned to control his synesthesia, saying that having a diagnosis has reassured him that his 'weird feelings' aren't a sign of madness but just a side-effect of his stroke."

The news came just days after the bank was fined £400 million for rigging foreign exchange markets between 2008 and 2013 – the period during which he was at the helm. The pay committee at RBS, which is 79 per cent owned by the Treasury, approved an award of around 250,000 shares in the bank in March as part of a long-term incentive plan. Although part of an existing scheme, it could have withheld the shares. RBS was one of five banks fined by the Financial Conduct Authority and US regulators after it was found a network of traders had colluded to manipulate currency markets. RBS and Hester are no strangers to political rows over pay. Earlier this year Chancellor George Osborne was forced to prevent the bank from paying its top bankers bonuses worth twice their salary, while in 2012 Hester was forced to give up a £963,000 bonus. Hester, whose mansion in Oxfordshire is thought to be worth more than £7 million, was ousted from his role in June 2013. He now runs insurance giant RSA, owners of MoreThan. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘The banks have paid large fines, but people are fed up with the fact that the bankers who have caused so much damage to our economy through their reckless behaviour can break the law and get away scot-free. 'As well as the new management taking back the bonuses of those responsible, prosecutors must look hard at whether criminal action against former senior managers and directors can also be obtained, so wrongdoers can be brought to justice.’ There is no suggestion that Hester was aware of any wrongdoing until official investigations began. Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Chris Leslie, said: ‘It will take a lot to convince me this scale of awards is truly justified. The pay committee at RBS, which is 79 per cent owned by the Treasury, approved an award of around 250,000 shares ‘If we have moved to long-term bonuses that can be clawed back then that has to bite if we discover misbehaviour.’ Mark Garnier, Conservative MP for Wyre Forest and a member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said: ‘We have to make these people get it that they are responsible for these organisations. 'They are in a position to set in place mechanisms and reporting lines that means if they can’t know every single transaction, they can make sure things have been done properly.’ It was unclear last night if the Chancellor was informed by RBS that it had made the award. RBS and Hester both declined to comment."

A Turkish soldier walks through the village of Senoba, Turkey, near the border with Iraq. The initial response by Turkish forces was to hit back by killing 32 rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, in southern Turkey, according to a statement on an official government Web site. Sunday's deadly attack on Turkish soldiers prompted outrage among citizens in Istanbul, Turkey, who took to the streets in protest. Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul said that, in addition to the 17 killed, 10 Turkish soldiers were missing after the ambush in southern Turkey. He denied reports they had been abducted by PKK rebels. Shortly after the attack, a wedding convoy tripped a landmine in Daglica, Turkey, near the ambush site, a Turkish government source said. The attack wounded 12 people and is believed to have been the work of PKK rebels, the source said.  Watch CNN's Nic Robertson report on the attack » After an emergency meeting Sunday of Turkey's military and political leaders President Abdullah Gul issued a statement saying: ""We will continue on our path of determination in fighting the terrorist organization. We respect Iraq's national borders. But [we] will not tolerate those who help and harbor terrorists."" There are fears that the escalation in fighting could spill into northern Iraq's Kurdish region, where Turkey insists the PKK leadership is based. But Iraq denies that, saying PKK leaders are hiding out in rugged mountain areas along the Turkish border that are not controlled by Iraq. Cross-border shelling between Turkish forces and PKK rebels in northern Iraq continued Sunday. Iraqi leaders fear Turkish ground forces could make a major push into northern Iraq after Turkey's parliament approved such an incursion in an overwhelming vote last week. Gonul on Sunday assured U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates that Ankara would not to carry out an imminent ground incursion, but he did not abandon the possibility of sending Turkish troops into northern Iraq, which Gonul called ""a safe haven"" for PKK rebels. Gonul and Gates met in Kiev, Ukraine. Gates said: ""A major cross-border operation would be contrary to Turkey's interests as well as to our own and that of Iraq."" Iraq's President Jalal Talabani, who is Kurdish, addressed the rising tensions with Turkey during a meeting with Kurdish regional leader Massoud Barzani in Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region. Talabani reiterated Iraq's demand that PKK rebels lay down their arms, and restated calls for a diplomatic solution. He also said Sunday that Iraqi forces are unable to find the rebel leaders because of the difficult landscape. ""The Turkish military, with its mightiness, could not annihilate them or arrest them, so how could we arrest them and hand them to Turkey?"" Talabani said at a news conference following his meeting with Barzani. Turkey's parliament last week passed a measure that enables its military to launch an incursion into northern Iraq and chase down Kurdish rebels. Although Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the vote in his parliament last week wouldn't necessarily trigger immediate military action against the PKK, the United States and Iraqi officials have been in high diplomatic gear for days in efforts to keep Turkey from carrying out the proposed cross-border assaults against the rebels. The United States fears a large-scale military operation by Turkey in northern Iraq would undermine the stability of the U.S.-backed government in Baghdad and jeopardize supply lines that support U.S. troops in Iraq. Tariq al-Hashimi, one of Iraq's two vice presidents and a top Sunni Arab leader, met with Turkish leaders last week about the tensions along the Iraq-Turkish border, and said the talks ""ended in good results,"" his office said in a statement. Iraq's Kurdish region -- which consists of Duhuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya provinces -- has had a close economic relationship with Turkey, and the passage of the Turkish measure has stoked anger there. When asked how Iraq's government would respond to the possibility of Turkish ground forces in northern Iraq, Barzani urged dialogue with Turkey but said Iraqi forces would act ""in self-defense."" ""We will not be a part of any such conflict,"" Barzani said. ""But if we are targeted directly we will defend ourselves.""

Now, in the beginning of her junior year, Lovell identifies as being transgender, however, Lovell told MDJ that a sex-change surgery may not be in her future. 'At this point, I can’t really tell,' Lovell said of the possibility of having a sex-change operation. 'It could change through different medical advances or just personal feelings later in life, so at this point, I’ll have to say I just don’t know.' Father: Lovell was escorted on to the field by her father, Joseph Lovell, who  has supported her journey of transformation Fifty: Lovell was elected to Walton High School's homecoming court among four other women chosen out of 50 nominees at the school Jeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality, an organization working to advance safety, fairness and opportunity for the LGBT community, said that Lovell's election as an openly transgender student is the first that they are aware of in Georgia. Graham also told MDJ that having transgender students on homecoming court is something many school districts need to be prepared to handle. Graham said that if a school's student body supports the participation of transgender students in homecoming court then that student should have the right to do so.

Victoria's Secret denied the gossip, saying in a statement to CNN that it intends to keep working with her.

People magazine and Us Weekly quoted chatty inside sources who claimed that Kerr has ""a difficult reputation"" and ""wasn't very timely."" However, an anonymous source told People that if Kerr were to cease working with Victoria's Secret, the reason wouldn't be because of any behavioral issues. ""It's purely contractual. She'll be coming back for the show, but it's unclear if she'll be in future campaigns,"" the source said. The president and chief marketing officer of Victoria's Secret, Ed Razek, doesn't seem to have a problem with the model and mom of one. He called Kerr, who welcomed son Flynn with husband Orlando Bloom in January 2011, ""one of the best models in the history of the business -- and easily one of the most popular."" Additionally, Razek continued, ""She is also a consummate professional. Any rumors to the contrary are simply untrue. While her international commitments have kept her away from us more than we'd like over the past few years, she will always be an Angel to me.""

And for one deceptive pub landlord the consequences of breaking that golden rule turned out to be painful when he was ordered to run 10k holding a giant pumpkin he had bought but pretended he grew himself. Paul Koffman, 42, was desperate to win the vegetable growing competition he runs in his home town of Flintshire in Wales. But he suffered a setback when his pumpkins failed to grow so he decided to buy one instead, and pretend it was home-grown. Paul Koffman, 42, claims he was left covered in bruises after he was forced to run 10k with his offending fake pumpkin entry However his fellow green-fingered competitors spotted the deception and decided to enforce their own version of punishment. The father-of two-was made to run more than six miles carrying the offending 14lb pumpkin throughout the streets of Flintshire for the town's 10k run. Not only was he left ashamed, but he claims the run left him battered and bruised. 'It was horrific carrying a 14-and-a-half pound pumpkin,' he said. 'Every eight steps or so I had to change the pumpkin’s position. Mr Koffman faked his pumpkin entry into the vegetable growing competition he runs every year in Flintshire The offending fake home-grown pumpkin was left discarded at the end of the 10k race 'I’m covered in bruises - it was absolutely horrendous. 'My shoulders and arms are really painful.' Mr Koffman organises the annual giant vegetable growing competition at his pub the Cross Keys at Llanfynydd, near Mold, North Wales. This year's challenge was to grow the largest pumpkin. About 360 runners took part in the 10k run. Mr Koffman came first in his age category and raised more than £100 for Nightingale House hospice. Laura Parry, the hospice’s area fundraising manager, said they were “absolutely thrilled” with Paul’s support."

It's the region that gave birth to all-conquering behemoths like Google and Apple, after all. But fast forward to 2015 and the playground of global technology has moved roughly 60 kilometers (37 miles) north to San Francisco. ""Information is the new currency and that currency is gushing through the streets of San Francisco,"" said Alan Collenette, regional managing director of real estate firm Colliers International. According to Collenette, firms like Twitter are relocating to the City by the Bay because it offers a more attractive lifestyle to talented employees. ""If you're in your 20s (or) 30s, you want to live in a vibrant environment where you're surrounded by like-minded people. Where there's a lot of interesting cultural stuff to do,"" Collenette said. ""And with the great respect to the suburbs where Apple was born, there's a lot more cultural diversity and a lot more to do (in San Francisco) than there is there. Last year, commercial real estate in San Francisco was snapped up in large parcels. As many as 14 different companies signed leases for more than 9,000 square meters (97,000 square feet) worth of space and property. Among those leasing were tech heavyweights like Pinterest and Trulia. ""Now in 2015, 60% of all leases done in San Francisco are for technology companies,"" Collenette said. ""28% of the top space users who occupy more than 250, 000 square feet are technology users. That's up from 8% in the dotcom boom. That's how dramatic the shift's been."" These cash-rich tech firms are also changing the game by shying away from the offices of yesterday. Beer taps, foosball tables, and bike racks are now the norm at offices in the city. Primo Orpilla has seen the change first hand while designing spaces for the likes of crowd-sourced company review platform, Yelp, and taxi app, Uber. ""The offices of just three or four years ago, they're definitely more hierarchically set up,"" Orpilla said. ""You had fewer conference rooms, a lot of the work stations went to the middle. What we're seeing now, we're basically wanting to share that space. Share the light, flatten the organization."" Orpilla adds that old warehouses with high ceilings in the South of Market District have become particularly popular. But demand has driven prices up with rates climbing for both commercial and residential properties. In a city that spans just seven by seven square miles space will eventually run out. For now though, the outlook is rosy for those riding the tech wave. ""There has never been a time when the world's economy depended so much on the ideas and the work product that come out of one location,"" said Collenette. ""It's the golden age, this is an era that's just beginning and the light isn't just shining on San Francisco for a brief moment in time. I firmly believe this is going to last long into the future."""

But she returned to find to her horror that staff at the Aldi store had smashed a window to get in, then pushed the Ford Fiesta into a bush, scratching the body. They claimed the ten-year-old vehicle had been obstructing a delivery lorry trying to use the private access road. Dumped: Janina Wasiuta finished work to discover her red £4,000 Ford Fiesta pushed off the road with the driver’s window in pieces and glass over the seat In a bush: The beauty therapist, who works just a hundred yards away, had moved from her regular parking spot which was closed due to maintenance work Angry: Miss Wasiuta said there were no double yellow lines or signs telling her she couldn't park in the road Yesterday beauty therapist Miss Wasiuta, 29, accused Aldi of vandalising her car, which was towed to a garage for repairs. She has reported staff to police. ‘It’s unbelievable – I’ve basically had my car vandalised by a big supermarket chain,’ she said yesterday. ‘I’ve been told it will take two weeks to repair it, which means I’m paying £8 a day in taxi fares – on top of my £95 insurance excess. ‘If someone blocked my drive and I damaged their car trying to move it, I’d have the police round. Why should Aldi be any different? The store’s attitude was disgusting – they didn’t even put a note on my window, they just left the car in a bush. There are no double yellow lines or signs. There were cars parked behind me and I don’t see how my car was causing an obstruction. ‘The salon’s only a moment away – why did no one come in to see if it belonged to an employee or a customer before smashing their way in?’ Yesterday three plastic barriers had been put up in an effort to stop people parking on the access road in Chorley, Lancashire. Janina Wasiuta finished work to discover her red £4,000 Ford Fiesta pushed off the road and in a bush When Miss Wasiuta returned to her car she found it in bushes with the windows smashed in Aldi said: ‘We have apologised to Miss Wasiuta and are covering all costs of the damage to her vehicle and all the associated expenses. ‘As a very last resort we had to move a vehicle that was preventing an Aldi delivery truck from reversing into the loading bay. 'Our store staff had searched for the owner for more than four hours. They also contacted the local police to try and obtain the registered owner’s details. 'Unfortunately these were not available. 'After every other option was taken into consideration, the car was then moved by Aldi staff. 'The owner of the car returned at approximately 9pm, three hours after we moved it. Staff at the Aldi say they were forced to break into the car so a delivery driver could access the store Picture shows where Janina's car was parked before members of staff broke in and pushed it out of the way The Aldi in Chorly, Lancashire, where staff broke in to a customer's car to move it out of the way 'We are in communication with the car owner to rectify the damage caused, have offered to pay for all repairs and have apologised for any inconvenience.' Lancashire County Council said: 'It’s not an LCC highway. It’s a private road.' While police can tow away a vehicle causing an obstruction on a public road, rules of trespass apply to a car parked on private land, legal experts say. The landowner could claim for trespass but any award would be likely to be as low as £20. And anyone damaging a car while trying to move it could be sued in the small claims court and face prosecution for criminal damage. Paul Watters, from the AA, said: ‘Motorists who cause an obstruction are a source of great frustration, but taking direct action in the knowledge it will cause damage to the car is completely unacceptable.’ Police are investigating last Friday’s incident as possible criminal damage.

The agency has appealed for the resettlement of ""vulnerable and sick"" children in Al Waleed refugee camp at the Iraqi-Syrian border. One of those who died in the camp was a 3-year-old Palestinian boy who was suffering from rickets and pneumonia. He died a few days ago in a Ramadi hospital and then was buried in Al Waleed. The other was a 14-year-old suffering from Hodgkin's disease who died in Baghdad last week. A 50-year-old man who was waiting to be resettled died earlier this month in Al Waleed. The agency says seven people, including three children, have died at the camp since refugees fleeing attackers began arriving at the border in March 2006. About 30 to 40 people arrive at the Al Waleed camp each week, the UNHCR reports. The agency has been pursuing medical resettlement. ""UNHCR has helped resettle one family of eight with several sick children from this camp to Norway last August. Another 11 medical cases submitted for resettlement are awaiting approval,"" the agency said, which is working to identify other medical cases. And it is urging the resettlement of the entire group. ""UNHCR has sought solutions for the whole group since last year and has only received positive indications from Sudan and Chile,"" the agency said. Thousands of Palestinians have lived in Iraq, with some going there when Israel was formed and others born there. The UNHCR notes that some got ""preferential treatment"" under the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. But they have been the targets of violence since he was toppled.

But the cost of paying for these mini mobile computers is plunging thousands into debt, it has been revealed. The Money Advice Trust (MAT) dealt with 17,766 calls to its National Debtline about telephone debt problems last year. A charity has blamed the rise of pricey smartphones for soaring debt. Pictured: The new iPhone 5s and 5c This represented a three-fold increase from 2007 – the year the iPhone was launched. The national charity is on course to deal with record calls this year with 13,389 between January and August, a 15 per cent increase on the same period a year ago. Costly: But customers refuse to be put off by price. These people queued for hours for the new iPhone in London's Covent Garden in September last year And phone debt is the reason behind 11 per cent of all helpline calls, compared to 4 per cent six years ago. According to Ofcom around two-fifths of UK adults own a smartphone. The highest monthly rates for the latest and most expensive iPhones are around £57 and the phones sold on their own can cost more than £500. A family-of-four could easily be paying at least £140 a month for mobiles, more than the average energy bill, said MAT. Chief executive Joanna Elson said: ‘Smartphones have in many ways revolutionised our lives, but we’ve certainly been made to pay for the privilege.’ The advent of the iPhone saw a revolution in high-performing and increasingly expensive phones, which for 42 per cent of people is their sole internet access point. MAT said 15 per cent of those in telephone debt using their advice service owed more than £1,000 on their phone bills. Miss Elson said: ‘Smartphones are sold without contracts for upwards of £500, which would prohibit many from getting one. ‘But with a contract the upfront cost all but disappears, to be replaced by a monthly fee incorporating much of the phone’s usage costs as well. ‘When people fall foul of that fee, they can find themselves with a growing debt problem. The figures suggest this is happening with more people taking out expensive smartphone contracts.’ She said consumers should only take on what they are ‘able to afford’ and creditors have a ‘duty of responsible lending to make sure that borrowers in financial difficulty are treated with understanding and forbearance’."

Henry Patterson started his first enterprise when he was just seven selling bags of manure for £1. The schoolboy slicker then went on to set up his own eBay store where he sold items he had bought from charity shops - and made himself £150. Now Henry - who looks like a junior Gordon Gekko from 80s film Wall Street - has started a children's online sweet shop called Not Before Tea. Nine-year-old entrepreneur, Henry Patterson (left), from Lidlington, in Bedfordshire, who is set to be a real life Gordon Gecko and (right) Michael Douglas as the character He has already had over 100 orders for his sweets and smashed his £10 profit target for the first month in the first week.

He proudly hands out business cards emblazoned with 'creative director' to fellow pupils at Swanbourne House School, Buckinghamshire. And he already has big plans for the future. As well as adding to his business portfolio he hopes hopes to direct his own film after writing a screenplay featuring the characters from his sweet shop. The schoolboy has gone into partnership with his mother Rebecca who runs an online confectionary store. Sweet success: Harry has recently launched his third business, an online sweet store A jar of the 'Not before Tea' range of sweets available on nine-year-old Henry Patterson's website Henry has come up with the idea, designed the logo and marketed his new business a children's sweet shop called Not Before Tea Henry, whose father Julian, 52, works in marketing, said: 'I started coming up with business ideas when I was five. I started selling manure and I loved it - even if it was a bit smelly. 'My friends couldn't believe it when I set up the sweet shop. But I don't think they were really surprised either because I've set up my other businesses before. 'No one knows the type of sweets that children like better than a child. I just love looking at the products there in front of me. 'The best part of the sweet shop is that I get to taste test all the sweets. My favourite one is the old fashioned liquorice straws. 'I get five per cent of what I make into my bank account and I try and spend it on things for the businesses. 'I want to try and carry on with this for the next ten years, but I want to set up more businesses after this one. I made a film about a tadpole that can't swim. I think I would like to be a film director when I'm older.' A screenshot of  Henry Patterson's Sherbet Pip company website Henry hopes hopes to direct his own film after writing a screenplay featuring the characters from his sweet shop Henry has created a whole story around his sweet products with two central characters - Sherbet and Pip. His jar containers come with pens so kids can doodle on their own designs and also include reward stickers for parents to give children who clean their teeth before bed. Henry added: 'I thought I didn't want to do just sweets so I came up with the idea of Sherbet and Pip. I really loved English at school and so I thought we should have a story to go along with the shop. 'I hate cleaning my teeth after I have eaten sweets but love getting stickers at the dentist. That's how I got the idea.' Henry has contributed his own product range to the site with sweet jars that include mud, worms and alien themed sweets. His mother, a PR manager, set up her Sherbetpip.co.uk site as part of a programme with Bedfordshire County Council that shows young people how easy it can be to start a small business. The pair are now in talks with producers at ITV's Saturday Night Takeaway about featuring the sweet jars in hampers to be given away at the show. Mrs Patterson, 39, said: 'Henry's got a business brain and thinks this venture is the start of other adventures. He could tell you how much everything costs and how much it costs to put together each jar. 'He has three ambitions. One is to make £10 from this business - which he's already achieved, one is to meet David Walliams and the other is to see his products sold in a big shop. 'He plans to keep this business going until he is 16 and all the money he makes is going into a bank account to help start any other future businesses. 'I'm really proud of him. But this is just how he works. He rings me from school and asks me if the site is live. 'But the only thing he is not allowed to do is pack the jars with sweets because of hygiene and health and safety. If he wants money he has to go out and try and make it himself.'"

Zhai Xiaobing, from Beijing, has received the support of hundreds of internet users following the joke about the party's congress on November 8. Chinese authorities have been especially sensitive to any perceived dissent about the party meeting, which closed last week, after ushering in a new generation of leaders. Ahead of the event, police sent activists out of Beijing and rounded up the hundreds of people who tried to draw the attention of central authorities to their grievances against local governments. Mr Xiaobing's tweet on November 5 suggested the next movie in the Final Destination horror film franchise would be about the Great Hall of the People collapsing on party delegates. He posted on Twitter: ‘An earth-shaking début will be seen at the global première on Nov. 8!’ The week-long congress began that day. After his Twitter account fell silent for a few days, his friend Liu Yanping grew worried and visited his home in Miyun county in Beijing's northeastern suburbs. Salute to China: Police salute the Chinese national flag before the opening of the Communist Party congress which Mr Xiaobing joked about There, his family members told Ms Yanping that Miyun county police had taken him away on November 7 and seized his computer. A Miyun county police officer, who would only give his surname, Sun, said that Zhai was being investigated for ‘spreading terrorist information’. Mr Xiaobing’s supporters have called the allegation absurd and more than 400 people have signed an online petition calling on police to release him and to have more of a sense of humour. Ms Yanping said: ‘I was very shocked when I realised what happened to him. ‘I've consulted a few lawyers and I feel that it's clear his Twitter joke does not amount to spreading terrorist information. It's just preposterous.’ New generation of leaders: Delegates listen as Chinese President Hu Jintao delivers his address at the opening of the 18th Communist Party Congress Pivotal party: Chinese authorities have been especially sensitive to any perceived dissent toward the Communist Party whose congress was held for a week from November 8 She said that she and a few other activists have been in touch with his family and would help hire a lawyer. She said state security officials visited his wife to warn her to keep a low profile. When contacted by phone, she refused to comment on her husband’s situation. The online petition, written by outspoken blogger and free speech advocate Wen Yunchao, urged authorities to lighten up. The letter said: ‘We solemnly request that Beijing police find a little sense of humour and not make a big deal out of nothing. ‘In particular, do not destroy the goodwill and anticipation the public has for the new office holders after the 18th party congress by limiting and persecuting an ordinary citizen's normal freedom of speech in such a groundless fashion.’ Need a sense of humour: People walk past a large screen televising the congress at Beijing Railway Station as online petitioners urge police to release Mr Xiaobing 'For greater freedom': Police patrol near the congress as a Human Rights Watch advocate said the party's decision to release Mr Xiaobing will show whether they are unwilling to change or respond to popular demands In trouble for tweet: Mr Xiaobing is being investigated for 'spreading terrorist information' for his tweet: 'An earth-shaking debut will be seen at the global premiere on Nov. 8!' Further enquiries were directed to the Beijing Public Security Bureau, which did not immediately respond to a faxed list of questions. A rights group said the case could be seen as a test of whether China's incoming leaders will continue a steady crackdown that authorities have imposed on the country's small community of activists, dissidents and lawyers in recent years. Maya Wang, a Hong Kong-based Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: ‘The new leadership has two choices. Continue down the path of criminal prosecution to signal that they are unwilling to change, or release Zhai to show goodwill that it is responding to popular demands for greater freedom.’"

""He also accepts that he has let down the sport he loves and all those associated with it, as well as the wider public,"" Stewart-Moore said in a statement. ""But most of all, and this is his greatest regret, he has let down his wife and children."" Dettori, who has five children with wife Catherine, is one of the world's most successful jockeys. He is most famous for riding seven successive winners in one meeting at prestigious English course Ascot in 1996, and has more than 500 Group-level victories in his career so far. He is a household name in Britain, where one bookmaker announced odds of his chances of success in next year's premier meetings immediately after the French authority's decision was announced. Dettori revealed in October that he will be ending his fulltime role at the Godolphin stable next year, and last month news broke about his positive test during a race meeting at the Longchamps course in Paris. ""Racing has been good to Frankie and he knows that his privileged position brings with it responsibility,"" Stewart-Moore said. ""For this reason he is determined to rebuild his reputation when he returns to the saddle."" France Galop said Dettori will have to undergo further drug testing from April 20 before he is allowed to return to racing. Stewart-Moore said the three-time British champion, who has admitted taking weight-loss drugs in the past, is taking full responsibility for the failed test. ""He is clear that the responsibility for his current situation lies squarely with him,"" Stewart-Moore said ""From the start of France Galop's inquiry he has acknowledged to them he has made a mistake and that the fault was his. ""Finally, he has asked me to thank everyone for the many messages of support he and his family have received."" The British Professional Jockeys' Association said it would support Dettori's rehabilitation, but denied there was a widespread problem of drug use among its members. ""From 2,607 in-competition urine tests and 3,697 breath tests since 2005, there is no evidence to suggest that there is a fundamental drug problem with jockeys,"" PJA chief executive Paul Struthers said. ""0.3% of urine tests were positive for drugs and 0.2% of both urine and breath tests were positive for alcohol."" The PJA said from 2005-11 it had recorded four positive tests for cocaine, one for cannabis and two for diuretics (water shedding drugs) -- both of which were for amateur riders. One alcohol positive was above the drink driving limit, and five were below. Struthers said the PJA was aiming to raise awareness about the issue of jockeys' mental wellbeing. ""As well as all the normal pressures that other sportsmen and women have to contend with, unlike many other sports jockeys have the added pressures of massively reduced calorific intake and are constantly at very real risk of serious injury,"" he said. ""When it comes to mental wellbeing, racing perhaps lags behind other sports particularly when it comes to raising awareness of the issues and the support that is available, and it is overdue that more was done."""

Few outsiders have ever seen it with their own eyes - but one photographer has now gained rare access to the heart of the Russian space programme. Mitch Karunaratne took the snaps of the highly secret Star City complex - known in Russian as Zvezdniy Gorodok - inside forests around 30 miles (48 kilometres) from Moscow. Photographer Mitch Karunaratne from London has taken rare photos of Russia's Star City. The facility is located deep in a forest about 30 miles (48 km) from Moscow Pictured is a Sokol spacesuit used by cosmonauts when travelling to and from space The centre, run by the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), is in a closed town where the legendary cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin trained. 12 April 1961 - First human in space (Yuri Gagarin) 5 May 1961 - First American in space (Alan Shepard) 16 June 1963 - First woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova) 21 July 1969 - First human on the moon (Neil Armstrong) 7 June 1971 - First manned space station (Soyuz 11/Salyut 1) 12 April 1981 - First manned space plane (Space Shuttle/STS-1) 20 November 1998 - Construction of the International Space Station (ISS) begins 15 October 2003 - First Chinese taikonaut in space (Yang Liwei) In fact it was previously named after Gagarin and his family still live within the area of the centre. Today - despite the area no longer being a military zone in 2008 - it remains difficult for outsiders to gain access. 'I grew up as self-proclaimed space fanatic - I was born in 1969 - and a photograph of Neil Armstrong landing on the moon has always hung in every house I've ever lived in and I've met Buzz Aldrin,' said Mr Karunaratne, from London. 'I grew up in the era of Star Trek and Star Wars and the Clangers, however the Russian space programme was always on the fringes, always mysteriously out of reach I felt. 'Star City is up and running and still the main space training centre for all international cosmonauts and astronauts visiting the space station as well as the centre for the Russian space programme. 'It is located about 30 miles [48 kilometres] east of Moscow, set within a deeply wooded area and it doesn't appear on any maps or have road signs. 'It is a ""closed"" town - and very tricky to get access to and has a heavily guarded border and access is for residents and space trainees.' The Star City facility is located deep in a forest about 30 miles (48 km) from Moscow Star City is used to train astronauts and cosmonauts for missions to space. Shown here is a centrifuge, which is used to test how cosmonauts respond to the intense G-forces experienced in take-off and landing Training facilities like these are used by agencies to prepare astronauts for missions in space. Seen here are mock-ups of modules from the ISS, which cosmonauts use to familiarise themselves with the layout before they travel to the space station The Sokol spacesuit, shown, was first introduced in 1973 and is still in use by cosmonauts today. It is only worn during take-off and landing, however, and is used to keep astronauts alive in the event of their spacecraft depressurising. For spacewalks a separate Orlan suit is used The centre was established in the 1960s and was originally called the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre. Since then it has trained at least 400 astronauts - or cosmonauts as they are called in Russia - from more than 30 different countries.' 'All personnel involved in the Soviet and Russian space programme, and their descendants have the right to live here,' Mr Karunaratne continued. 'It houses both space training installation buildings, as well as accommodation, shop, church and a school. Yuri Gagarin's family still live here.' Mr Karunaratne said inside the complex there were several life-size mock-ups of the International Space Station used for training. One is even submerged in a swimming pool where cosmonauts can practice their space walks, although Mr Karunaratne was not allowed to take photos in this area. Seen here is a mural of historic Russian space achievements. On the left is the short-lived Buran shuttle that completed one unmanned flight in 1988. In the middle is Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite, which launched in 1957. On the right is Buran attached to the Energia rocket that took it to space The facility is used to prepare astronauts and cosmonauts for trips to the ISS (pictured) Shown here is a mock-up of the Soyuz spacecraft used to take astronauts to the ISS. The Soyuz family of spacecraft has been in operation since the 1960s, although it has been continuously upgraded since then Shown here is  a statue of Yuri Gagarin, who on 12 April 1961 became the first human ever to travel to space. Star City was once also known as the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre The centre also contains technology from the history of Russia's space endeavours (shown). There is also a mock-up of the ISS in a swimming pool cosmonauts can use, although Mr Karunaratne was not allowed to take photos in this area 'All cosmonauts from the Soviet space programme and then the Russian Federation Space Agency have trained at this facility,' he added. 'The facility has a very lived in look, but is cared for with such obvious pride. The heart and soul of the Russian space programme, and indeed the Russia people, can be felt very profoundly here. 'Dreams of outer space have been a constant in Soviet society since the 1920s, which have survived perestroika and the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991. 'Access was limited, and although I was able to walk around with my guide freely I was not able to take photographs [everywhere]. 'The image of the lake Yuri Gagarin helped to dig, the supermarket where all goods are plentiful and cheap, the washing of the current space team pegged to a green nylon rail - will forever be those images I wish I had taken.' 'It is a ""closed"" town - and very tricky to get access to and has a heavily guarded border and access is for residents and space trainees,' said Mr Karunaratn. Shown is a mock-up of a docking module on the ISS The facility apparently has a very lived in look but is 'cared for with pride' according to Mr Karunaratn. Seen on the left are some interconnected mock-ups of ISS modules at Star City, while on the right is Nasa's own ISS mockup at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center"

South African president Jacob Zuma said the 95-year-old, who was transferred home by ambulance in August to spend his final weeks there, had 'passed on peacefully in the company of his family'. Mandela's third wife, Graca Machel, 68, is believed to have been by his side, as well as some of his children, grandchildren, stepchildren, a priest, and elders from his native Thembu tribe. Scroll down for video Zindzi Mandela seen leaving her hotel on December 6, 2013 in London Emerged: His daughter, Makaziwe Mandela, arrived at her father's Johannesburg home this evening Family home: Nelson Mandela was surrounded by friends, family and tribal elders as he died at home in Houghton, Johannesburg, while police stood guard outside Finally at peace: Nelson Mandela died yesterday at home in the company of his third wife Graca Machel, left, (pictured with Hillary Clinton when she visited him in August last year), relations and friends Mandela's daughter Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, centre, and her daughters Tukwini and Ndileka, right, are thought to have been with him at the end But there was no sign of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Mandela's second wife who married him in 1958 and stood by him throughout his 27 years in jail before the 38-year marriage ended bitterly in 1996. The former president's condition had fluctuated since June, when he was admitted to hospital suffering from an infection and it was widely feared he was close to death. His condition improved enough for him to be allowed home, where his bedroom had been adapted into what was said to resemble an intensive care unit. Last month Mrs Madikizela-Mandela said her former husband had beaten a bout of pneumonia but was still 'quite ill' and was unable to speak because of tubes inserted into his lungs to clear them of liquid. She said he was using facial expressions to communicate, and said the house had to be kept sterile to ensure the infection did not recur. This week Mandela's condition again deteriorated, and he was reported to be on life support and unconscious as the end neared. On Wednesday, the day before her father died, Mandela's eldest daughter Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, 60,  said: 'You can see he is struggling, but the fighting spirit is there with him.' And his grandson by his late son Makgatho Mandela, Ndaba Mandela, 30, said: 'He is not doing well at home in bed.' It is not known if Winnie Mandela, who was married to the statesman from 1958-1996, was there at the end Mandela's grandson Mandla, 39, left, is believed to have visited his grandfather at home shortly before he died, while South African president Jacob Zuma, who announced the death last night, above, visited last month Graca Machel, 68, married Nelson Mandela on his 80th birthday and they were together for 15 years until he died Ndaba's older brother Mandla Mandela, 39, is believed to have been with Mandela in his final hours, as were Graca Mandela's children Josina and Malenga Machel, who are in their 30s.  A priest was also said to have been summoned to the house yesterday evening. The former personal assistant Zelda la Grange, 43, is although thought to have been close to the family as Mandela's condition worsened. During the last hours before his death at 8.50pm Johannesburg time, elders from Mandela's native Thembu clan joined his relatives at his side. The elders would have performed, either at Mandela's home or later in the mortuary, a traditional ceremony called 'the closing of the eyes', to herald the transition from life to the next stage. The flag-covered coffin carrying the body of former president Nelson Mandela left his home today The ceremony would have involved the elders talking to Mandela, and also to his ancestors, to explain what was happening to his spirit during each stage as he passed from life on earth, CNN reported. This morning, Mandela's body was removed from his house in a coffin draped in a South African flag and taken to a military hospital in Pretoria, before the start of a 10-day mourning period. Next Sunday a state funeral, expected to be the biggest funeral Africa and possibly the world has ever seen, will take place in the Eastern Cape village of Qunu where Mandela spent his childhood."

The annual swarm rose above La Crosse, Wisconsin from the river on Sunday evening in a dark cloud so dense it caused a three-car roadway collision, blacked out the sun and even lit up area weather radar. The nuisance occurrence always causes headaches but experts say this year's swarm was bigger than normal, though like every year the insects die off just as quickly as they emerge. Scroll down for video Living blanket: This year's mayfly emergence in the Mississippi Valley focused near La Crosse, Wisconsin was bigger than usual -- but as always became a stomach-turning nuisance Atmospheric anomaly: The swarm was so thick and dense it appeared much like a rain storm on weather radar And according to experts, the sizable swarm is a positive sign for water quality and after the many millions of bugs mate and die off within a day or two they'll become a long-awaited feast for famished fish. While millions of protein and fat-filled bugs dying off is great news for fish--and, later, fishermen--the news is not so good for drivers. In addition to the swarm briefly darkening out the sun this year, the less fortunate mayflies that find themselves smashed on the road become a thick, oily sludge that can and does lead to car accidents. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports that a Wisconsin road became so slick from the mayflies Sunday evening it caused at least one of the drivers involved in a three-car crash to lose control of her vehicle. They also noted the limited visibility at the time of the crash. Two people were injured in the crash, but only one person was taken to a local hospital. The problem has been so serious in the past that authorities have had to dump sand onto roadways and bridges to improve traction, much like salt and sand are used in the snowy months. One of the most striking things about this year's Mississippi emergence was its marked radar echo. Like a freak rainstorm in reverse, the emergence began to show up as a raucous blue and green around La Crosse at about 8:45 on Sunday. The mayflies quickly moved along with a northerly wind up the Mississippi and appeared on radar screens just as a light-moderate rainfall might, according to NOAA. Over the course of around three hours, the radar faded as the mayflies spread out. By midnight, they were all but gone. And by no later than Tuesday, they were all dead, having mating and laying eggs to ensure next year's hatch. Left behind, of course, are their millions of gossamer bodies, piled in heaps along the riverbank, in parking lots and on porches and all over businesses and homes. Dangerous? This year's emergence of the little bugs took place Sunday evening and quickly enveloped the Mississippi River town, even causing car accidents Gross: The nuisance bugs cover just about everything once they emerge and nearby residents are warned to cover their mouths and noses Slick conditions: A car accident involving three vehicles was reported this year after the protein and fat-rich bugs created a greasy mush on the road. No serious injuries were reported, however Authorities are sometimes forced to use sand on the roads, much as they do during the snowy months, to prevent accidents caused by the greasy bug slicks Messy: The bugs are a blessing for hungry wildlife but a curse for home and business owners who have to deal with the aftermath Over the course of around three hours, the radar faded as the mayflies spread out. By midnight, they were all but gone. And by no later than Tuesday, they were all dead, having mating and laying eggs to ensure next year's hatch. Left behind, of course, are their millions of gossamer bodies, piled in heaps along the riverbank, in parking lots and on porches and all over businesses and homes. The mayfly (Ephemera) looks innocent enough...when there's just one While the bugs are large and can be a nuisance, people are urged not to kill them because they omit an unpleasant fishy odor when squashed. Mayflies are an important source of nutrition for many species, including a wide variety of fish and birds. They’re an annoyance because they stick to clothes and sometimes land in hair. However, they do not bite humans. The mayfly population goes through cycles, said Don Schloesser, a researcher at the Great Lakes Science Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Some years they come earlier than others. This year along the Mississippi the emergence came later than usual, possibly due to earlier flooding. Mayflies typically live for a day or two before dying. But the life cycle actually lasts two years. Mayflies begin as eggs on the water’s surface before the eggs sink to the bottom of the lake. The larvae hatch and burrow into the mud. Later, they wriggle out of their burrows and take off from the water. Die-off: The bugs die off and pile up in clumps after just a day or so, creating heaps of insect carcasses to clean up It's a good thing? The mayflies are annoying but indicate a healthy waterway. They also make the environment even more vibrant by feeding hungry fish"

The men -- Vijay Jadhav, Mohammad Qasim and Salim Ansari -- were sentenced to die under an amended Indian law that sets death as the maximum sentence if convicted of more than one sexual assault, according to Nikam. The three were found guilty of gang-raping a telephone operator a month before attacking a photojournalist in a deserted Mumbai mill in August. Five people, including a young boy, were involved in the photojournalist rape case, Nikam said. One of them has been sentenced to life in prison, while the youngest is facing a trial before a juvenile justice board. Those convicted can appeal their sentences to a higher court. Violent crimes against women have been in the spotlight in India since a 23-year-old woman was raped and beaten by several men on a bus in December 2012. The victim later died in a Singapore hospital. The shocking attack provoked outrage across India, leading to calls for improved safety and treatment of women. Since then, the Indian media have intensified their focus on rape cases. Attacks against foreign women have also been reported. The 2012 case prompted lawmakers to change statutes to fast-track the arrest and questioning of anyone implicated in a rape. INTERACTIVE: The girl whose rape changed a country"

Every blue-chip firm listed in London fell in the worst single day of trading since the dark days of 2008 when investment bank Lehman Brothers imploded. As analysts spoke of 'a tidal wave of selling', the FTSE 100 index fell 239.37 points to 5092.23 – a drop in value of £62.3billion. Plummeting: The FTSE crashed by 5 per cent today against a backdrop of the euro zone crisis and damaging U.S. unemployment figures Elsewhere, the German stock market fell 5.8 per cent, Paris dropped 5.5 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial  Average dropped 3.9 per cent in  New York. The Lehman debacle tipped the global economy into recession – and fears are mounting that the developed world is on the brink of another devastating downturn. One reason for the panic was the revelation that a lender in the eurozone was forced to go cap in hand to the European Central Bank for £300million in emergency funding. Analysts said the 'worrying' development showed banks are too nervous to lend to each other – just as they were at the height of the financial crisis. Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley warned yesterday that the United States and the eurozone are 'hovering dangerously close to recession'. Despair may have engulfed the markets, but one British entrepreneur found himself £300million richer yesterday. Dr Mike Lynch, the son of an Essex fireman, saw his software firm Autonomy sold to U.S. giant Hewlett-Packard for £7billion. The deal values his 8.1 per cent stake in the FTSE 100 firm at £567million. It was worth just under £284million before the takeover bid was announced. It is an extraordinary success for Dr Lynch, who began work on the firm when he was writing his post-doctoral thesis at Cambridge University on 18th century theologian Thomas Bayes, who tried to prove the existence of God through mathematics. Autonomy now has more than 16,000 clients worldwide including Nasa, Procter & Gamble, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The technology Dr Lynch developed allows computers to analyse data across a range of media, making it useful for tracking down fraud or even searching for terrorists. Investors are also increasingly concerned about the health of the banking system in Europe as the debt-crisis crippling the single currency bloc rumbles on. Officials at the Bank of England said the exaggerated sense of fear in the markets may be holding back the recovery. The man who became a hate figure to many in Britain for designing the modern European Union yesterday admitted that it was now 'on the edge of the precipice'. Jacques Delors, 86, a federalist Frenchman, used his time as European Commission chief in the 1980s to expand its power over national governments and pave the way for the single European currency. Will Hedden, at IG Index in London, said: 'Panic selling accelerated in the biggest losing day yet of this summer sell-off. 'The fear factor has reached boiling point. Banking stocks have been decimated across Europe, with indiscriminate selling even in banks that maintain that their exposure to the crisis is slim. 'No sector is surviving this tidal wave of selling.' Damaging confidence: Analysts say German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy's plans to bail out debt-ridden eurozone members would disproportionately hit the UK The financial markets have been rocked by a crisis of leadership in recent weeks as politicians on both sides of the Atlantic failed to come up with policies to tackle debts and promote growth. The FTSE 100 index has lost 1,000 points, or £260billion of its value, since its 2011 peak in February. Dark days: Today's jobless figures have done nothing for Barack Obama's domestic standing The majority of the slump has taken place this month in one of the most bruising episodes in stock market history. It has hit the value of retirement pots for millions and left investors across the country nursing heavy losses. UK bank shares were the worst hit in London yesterday with taxpayer-supported Royal Bank of Scotland down 11.3 per cent and Lloyds Banking Group down 9.3 per cent. The shares are worth less than half what they were when the Government bailed the banks out – meaning UK taxpayers are sitting on losses of £34.5billion in the two companies. The European banking sector has lost 30 per cent of its value this year. French banks were back in the firing line yesterday with Societe Generale down 11.6 per cent. It came after the ECB provided more than £300million of emergency funds to an unnamed lender – the first such loan since February. 'This shows that the situation has escalated,' said Citigroup analyst Juergen Michels. Morgan Stanley cut its global growth forecasts for this year from 4.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent and for 2012 from 4.5 per cent to 3.8 per cent. 'The path now looks even more bumpy, below-par and brittle than previously thought,' said Joachim Fels, who co-heads Morgan Stanley's global economic team. He said the main reason for the downturn was the failure of politicians and regulators in Washington and Europe to tackle the sovereign debt crisis crippling the world economy. Hundreds of thousands of families in the UK are over-indebted and 'vulnerable' if financial conditions get worse, a senior Bank of England director said last night. Andrew Haldane, the Bank's executive director in charge of ensuring financial stability, said one in 14 British households is in negative equity.

As people are forced to watch impotently as stock markets lurch once again into turmoil, wiping billions of pounds off the value of their savings and pensions, it is understandable that many are riven with anxiety. Fear is stalking the trading floors and it is contagious, casting an ominous shadow over all of our lives. But the question is whether the extreme reactions we have seen on the stock markets over the past few weeks are justified. As Andrew Haldane, a senior director at the Bank of England, pointed out yesterday, the fear factor is rampant on the markets. Not all of it is rational, and these waves of terror engulfing the stock exchanges are actually making matters worse. During the boom, traders were swept along by a wave of euphoria and loaded themselves with risks that proved to be wildly over-optimistic. Haldane now believes the markets may have switched to the opposite pole, with traders abnormally reluctant to take  risks because the psychological scarring from the losses of the last meltdown is still fresh and painful. That exaggerated fear of risk – equally irrational as the mindless exuberance of the boom years – is in itself a brake on economic recovery. When stock markets plunge, companies become reluctant to expand or invest. Consumers cut down on their spending and stay out of the shops. Instead of applying our energy to creating growth, building new businesses and embarking on new ventures, firms and individuals retreat into a paralysing state of gloom and timidity. With markets in the paranoid state of the past few weeks, even minor or quite predictable pieces of news can produce enormous swings on the trading screens. No-one should underestimate the power of herd-behaviour on the markets, which are driven by the opposing forces of greed and fear. Driven by greed and fear: A man walks past the London Stock Exchange in the City of London. A Cambridge study found hormone levels significantly affected traders' behaviour Cambridge University researchers even found in a study of saliva from City workers that hormonal activity among young male traders magnified the booms and busts. They discovered that when dealers hit a winning streak their testosterone levels soared, making them overconfident and intoxicated with their own success. But when markets dipped, the researchers saw a rise in the stress hormone cortisol, which made the dealers shy of risk and magnified the downward slide in markets. But there are some very good reasons to be fearful. The banking crisis that caused the market meltdown in 2008 has transformed itself into a sovereign debt crisis. Question marks now hover over the indebtedness not only of smaller nations such as Greece and Portugal, but even the United States, whose Treasury bonds were once considered impregnable. Many households, banks and countries remain dangerously mired under the weight of their own foolish borrowings. Keep calm and carry on: A stock market trader grips his forehead as shares tumble in this picture from the 2008 crash. Dealers can and do wipe millions from the value of shares as the mood takes them But panic does not help. We should not allow the economic recovery in this country to be held hostage to hysteria in the dealing rooms. The dealers can and do wipe billions of pounds off share values as the mood takes them – often for the points slashed from the FTSE 100 to be restored the next day. But whatever their frenzy leads them to do, most of the real assets that are vital to our economy remain unaffected. Our homes, offices and factories are still standing; we still have our brainpower and most of all our resilience. To use another catchphrase from the 1930s, when markets succumb to a bout of madness, we need to 'Keep Calm and Carry On."

Declan Rooney, 42, claims he is ‘Britain’s most successful sperm donor’ and says he has donated sperm to two more women who have already given birth. He also has six children born naturally with three different mothers – meaning he has the potential to be the father of 55 children. The former web designer runs his website under the alias Upton North and advertises himself on Facebook to single women, lesbians and couples desperate for a baby. Last night experts called for an investigation into the unregulated and potentially dangerous service he provides to women he meets online, with one sociologist saying that Mr Rooney was ‘determinedly engineering a one-man eugenics movement’. Medical experts fear he could create a ‘ticking timebomb’ by flouting official guidelines for sperm donation, which limit the number of families that legitimate sperm donors can help create to a maximum of ten. As well as growing up without knowing their father, his children will potentially live close to each other, meaning that half-brothers and sisters may meet and unwittingly have children of their own. The murky world of unregulated sperm donation has come under increasing scrutiny from watchdogs as the internet offers men and women easy opportunities to meet up anonymously and create families – without needing to qualify or pay for expensive private fertility treatment, overseen by doctors. A cycle of artificial insemination costs £850 privately and is only offered to selected patients on the NHS. Rooney set up his anonymous site last March, offering to visit women in their homes or hotel within a 50-mile radius of his Middlesbrough home and give them a sample of his sperm in a specimen pot for them to inseminate themselves. His website, which was taken down last night after he was contacted by The Mail on Sunday, stated: ‘I am willing to help either through artificial insemination or naturally with no strings attached.’ Despite that wording, he told this newspaper that he does not have sex with the women. Sperm donations are not illegal unless a man charges for the service, but the risks of private donations include reports of women being abused, pressured into sex or forced to hand over money when they meet a donor. Rooney, who insists he acts within the law, says he only charges ‘expenses’ and that his motives are purely ‘altruistic’. He said: ‘I like helping people’. And he added: ‘Have you changed anyone’s lives for the better?’ His cynical advert: Declan Rooney boasted of 'natural' insemination, but insisted he did not offer sex Since becoming a sperm donor, Rooney says two lesbian women in the North East have given birth to his children. He said: ‘When I was told, I was really happy for the mothers. I like meeting new people, I like hearing their stories, I like problem-solving. I’m quite an altruistic person. I haven’t done anything illegal. ‘I set myself up as a private donor and have been inundated – I have 5,000 emails. If they are too far out of the area I say no to them. If you say you’re a sperm donor, people say it’s really smutty, but if someone said they were an egg donor it’s like “Wow that’s amazing”. There were a few days when I had a success each day. It’s a good feeling.’ On Rooney’s webpage he backed up his claims by posting photos of ultrasounds scans, positive reviews from female recipients and an image of a specimen pot. A HUMAN Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) spokesman said: ‘Unfortunately, women finding a sperm donor online, rather than through a licensed clinic, run a number of risks. Apart from the personal safety risks to the woman, the donor won’t have been screened for infectious diseases like HIV, or for inherited illnesses, and he will probably also be the legal parent of any child that is born.' Dr Suvir Venkataraman of London’s Harley Street Fertility Clinic, added: ‘A registered clinic will inform a child of a donor who else has been born using their sperm so they don’t have a sexual relationship with someone sharing the same genes. This man cannot expect to keep tabs on everyone and that is a big risk.’ Mr Rooney, who says his partner ‘understands my reasons for donating’, claims that his family have had no medical issues in five generations. ‘I wouldn’t donate if I had something genetically wrong. And there is no risk that my offspring will unknowingly have sex with each other because evolution makes sure that we are not attracted to people with the same genes,’ he claimed. He also boasted that he is ‘immune’ from the Child Support Agency. ‘The CSA has to find your taxable income and assets. They would have difficulty. I’m not scared of them,’ he said. Mr Rooney was photographed on the front page of the Daily Mail in 1993 leaving court smirking after he was found guilty of causing £60,000 of graffiti damage. He was given a suspended sentence and served seven months in a young offenders’ institution while waiting to stand trial. As he stepped out of the dock he said: ‘My barrister’s a genius. I’m laughing. It’s a soft touch.’ Questioned on his criminal past last night, he said: ‘I don’t mention it to recipients, but if the subject comes up then I will talk about it.’ Sociologist Claire McQuoid has researched private sperm donation and is setting up a charity for women who have been abused by donors. She said: ‘When Upton North appeared on the scene he developed a reputation for someone determined to impregnate as many women as possible, with no concern for child welfare, or indeed the women themselves. His aggressive online marketing is akin to a eugenics mission where he competes with other donors.’"

The Braintree, Massachusetts, police records show that police in 1986 believed they had probable cause to arrest Bishop on some charges in her brother's death. However, no charges were filed in that case. Bishop is charged with capital murder and three counts of attempted murder in a Friday shooting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, where she was a biology professor. She is eligible for the death penalty in Alabama. Authorities have said Bishop shot her brother, Seth, at the family's Braintree home in December 1986. A state police report on the 1986 incident was released to the news media over the weekend, but Braintree police said their records of the shooting were missing until Tuesday. Probable cause existed in 1986 for charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition, according to a statement issued Tuesday by the office of Norfolk County, Massachusetts, District Attorney William Keating. The statute of limitations has passed on those charges, as well as on a potential charge of ""wanton and reckless conduct,"" the lowest standard for manslaughter in Massachusetts, according to the statement. The recovered documents don't contradict previously released information about the account of the siblings' mother, who told police she witnessed the shooting and said it was accidental, according to the statement. The statement did not explain how the records came to be missing or when or how they were found. The December 6, 1986, shooting of Seth Bishop came under renewed scrutiny after Friday's shooting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.  Authorities said Bishop, also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, was attending a faculty meeting in a university building when she shot six colleagues. She was arrested as she was leaving the building. On Saturday, Braintree Police Chief Paul Frazier told reporters that the department's records pertaining to the 1986 shooting were missing. Braintree Mayor Joseph Sullivan announced Sunday  a search for the documents had been started, which resulted in the find announced Tuesday. Describing the 1986 shooting on Saturday, Frazier said that Bishop had fled her home with a gun after she shot her brother and had unsuccessfully attempted to pull over a driver in a vehicle. The newly recovered documents do not refer to an incident involving a vehicle. Frazier also said that police spotted Bishop and arrested her nearby, but she eventually was released. ""I cannot tell you what the thought process was behind our releasing her at the time,"" he said Saturday about the decades-old case. A 1987 state police report released over the weekend cited interviews between police and Bishop's parents, in which her mother said the gun discharged accidentally. Braintree police told state police investigators that ""indications were that Amy Bishop had been attempting to manipulate the shotgun and had subsequently brought the gun downstairs in an attempt to gain assistance from her mother in disarming the weapon"" when it went off, shooting her brother in the chest. Read the report on the 1986 shooting But Frazier said Saturday that Officer Ronald Solimini, who was involved in the case 23 years ago, said that Bishop had shot her brother during an argument. John Polio, who was Braintree police chief in 1986, also said he recalled reports of an argument between the two. But neither the 1987 state police report nor the newly found documents detail a disagreement between the siblings. The state report references a disagreement between Bishop and her father, who was not home when the shooting occurred. In an uncovered December 6, 1986, record, then-police Lt. James Sullivan wrote that Bishop ""stated earlier there had been a family 'spat' and she had gone to her room. (Unknown at this time how much earlier this family 'spat' had been)."" Police decided not to file charges, the December 6, 1986, report by Sullivan indicates, because ""with the current information it would appear to be an accidental shooting."""

In divorce filings, her ex-husband, Kaine Horman, said he believes that Terri Horman ""is involved in the disappearance of my son Kyron."" Court documents also allege Terri Horman attempted to hire a man to kill her husband. Investigators are seeking anyone who may have seen a white pickup truck believed to have been driven by Terri Horman on the morning Kyron vanished. Thursday will mark Kyron's eighth birthday.

The South Korean tech giant's Galaxy camera lets users connect to a mobile network or Wi-Fi to share photographs and video without having to use a computer as a go-between. While it's not the first to the market, analysts say Samsung's financial and marketing clout suggest it could be the biggest threat yet to Japanese domination of the digital camera industry. Scroll down for video Android functionality: The Samsung Galaxy Camera, which runs off Google's mobile OS. The device launched in Japan today, a direct attempt to take on the Japanese firms which dominate the camera industry That sector, which research firm Lucintel says will grow to be worth $46billion by 2017, is currently under the sway of a few big brands including Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Nikon and Olympus. The Galaxy camera, which is available in the UK for £349, features a 4.8-inch LCD touchscreen and a 21x optical zoom lens. Users can send photos instantly to other mobile devices via a 4G network, access the Internet, email and social network sites, edit photos and even play games. The easy-to-use camera, and the quality of the pictures, is aimed at mid-market 'pro-sumers' - not quite professional photographers but those who don't mind paying a premium for user options not yet available on a smartphone - such as an optical, rather than digital, zoom, better flash, and image stabilisation. The appeal of high picture quality cameras with wireless connection has grown as social media services like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter drive a boom in rapid shoot-and-share photos. Discreet: From the front the Galaxy Camera looks like any other compact Analysts nevertheless say the company is set for a tough battle with more established Japanese firms. 'Samsung has a tough row to hoe against the likes of Canon and Nikon in the camera brand equity landscape,' said Liz Cutting, senior imaging analyst at research firm NPD Group. 'Yet as a brand known more in the connected electronic device arena, Samsung has a unique opportunity to transfer strength from adjacent categories into the dedicated camera world.' The Korean group, which is currently battling for mobile gadget supremacy against Apple, is already a global market leader in televisions, smartphones and memory chips. Samsung last year brought its camera and digital imaging business - one of its smallest - under the supervision of JK Shin, who heads a mobile business that generated 70 per cent of Samsung's $7.4 billion third-quarter profit. 'Our camera business is quickly evolving ... and I think it will be able to set a new landmark for Samsung,' Shin said at a launch event in Seoul today. 'The product will open a new chapter in communications - visual communications,' he said, noting good reviews for the Samsung Galaxy camera which went on sale in Europe and the U.S. earlier this month. However, traditional digital camera makers are not taking the new challenge lying down. Canon, considered a leader in profitability in corporate Japan with its aggressive cost cutting, saw its compact camera sales eroded in the most recent quarter by smartphones. In response it has just introduced its first mirrorless camera to tap into a growing market for small, interchangeable-lens cameras that rival Nikon entered last year. Nikon has also recently introduced an Android-embedded Wi-Fi only camera."

This freakish monstrosity, which some cynics might say looks a lot like a normal woodland animal, had been attacking cows and calves by savagely biting their feet, drawing parallels to the Chupacabra of Latin American legend. The vet is at a loss as to what the creature is, claiming two similar creatures have been spotted in the region, but they both managed to evade their pursuers by melting into the forests like supernatural beings. Or small woodland animals, which the body closely resembles. Is this monstrous beast, killed by a Belorussian farmhand, the legendary chupacabra or is there a more pedestrian explanation? We may never know... The region's hunters are also at a loss. Some of them believe it is a mutant amalgam of a number of species because it resembles a hyena, has the features of a fox, a raccoon and a dog, reports English Russia. The vet described it as a 'sensation' and vowed to burn the corpse of the killed animal. Presumably in case it comes back to life. But an earlier discovery may be the key to unlocking this mystery. A Ukrainian farmer killed a similar animal last year and gave the body of the animal to biologists. Speculation was rife about the creature, with some claiming that it could be a 'mutant' fox poisoned by radiation, while another theory was that it was a hybrid originating from a secret Soviet plant conducting tests on animals relating to chemical or biological weapons development. A fox mutated by radiation? Or the by-product of a sinister Soviet experiment. No, according to Ukrainian scientists, it's a raccoon dog The biologists, however, pointed out it was a raccoon dog, which were be bred on Soviet farms in 1939, but were released into the wild when the Second World War started. The Chupacabra is a Latin American monster that attacks livestock, usually goats, and drinks their blood. The name itself is derived from the Spanish 'chupar' ('to suck') and 'cabra' ('goat'). Descriptions of them vary from reptilian with spikes or quills on its back to hairless dogs with fangs and claws. Someone in Piedmont, North Carolina, sent this picture of a mangy dog-like creature into a local TV station with the caption: 'Chupacabra's do exist' Since the legend of the mythical Mexican predator first emerged, there have been 'sightings' of the Chupacabra all over the world. One of these took place earlier this week in Piedmont, North Carolina, after a local spotted a mangy, fox-like creature fitting with the description bestowed on the 'goat-sucker' or 'devil-dog'. A picture was taken by a woman called Ramona who sent it into a local news site with the caption, 'Chupacabras do exist! Scientists have speculated that the creatures could be coyotes infected by parasites after one animal was discovered last July following a fatal attack on livestock. The first reported sighting was in 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood. Their mysterious deaths supposedly spawned the legend of the chupacabra in Latin America. Months later, the creature was allegedly spotted in CanÃ³vanas, where as many as 150 animals had been killed. Since then, there have been attacks allegedly carried out by the creature across South and Central America, and even into New Mexico and Texas."

In a scathing assessment, the respected centre-Right think tank Civitas accuses the Prime Minister of using billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to ‘rebrand his party and cement the coalition with the Liberal Democrats’. The study warns that the wasteful Department for International Development is almost beyond reform and suggests it should be effectively shut down. It says future aid spending should be handled by the Foreign Office, which takes a broader view of Britain’s interests, including trade. The study suggests that a third of Dfid’s vast budget should be handed to the Ministry of Defence to pay for ‘dual use’ equipment such as helicopters and ships that could be used in emergency relief missions as well as combat. And it calls for Mr Cameron’s ‘exorbitant and self-indulgent’ target to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on aid to be scrapped, saying there is no evidence it will help the world’s poor. The findings come as ministers prepare to increase the aid budget by a staggering 30 per cent in the coming year in order to meet the Prime Minister’s target. Total aid spending will rise from £8.65billion in the 2012-2013 financial year to £11.3billion in 2013-2014 – an increase of £2.65billion. Today’s 250-page study will make uncomfortable reading for Mr Cameron, who has stuck to his pre-election aid pledge despite imposing austerity measures on virtually every other area of public spending. The study says there is no evidence foreign aid helps the world's poor such as these refugee children in Somalia The book, by journalist Jonathan Foreman, questions both the value of the extra spending and Mr Cameron’s motives for ordering it. Mr Foreman says increased aid spending has been used by the Prime Minister to ‘detoxify’ the Tory image, describing it as ‘one of the most expensive marketing campaigns in history’. He accuses Mr Cameron of ‘taking advantage of the real generosity of the British people’, adding: ‘A set of policies trumpeted as manifesting generosity is in fact a cynical, ruthless and morally reprehensible con job pushed by marketing gurus for whom their real-world effects in the underdeveloped world are largely irrelevant.’ Mr Foreman also suggests that Britain’s political elite, who all back the aid increase, are more interested in helping the poor abroad than at home. ‘Such people are perhaps more likely to engage with poor Africans and South Asians on their holidays than they are to encounter needy people in their own country,’ he writes. A Dfid spokesman said: 'Sticking to our pledge is both the right thing and the smart thing to do and will create a safer, more prosperous world. 'Fighting global poverty means tackling the root causes of problems such as disease and terrorism which matter to us here in Britain. 'The Coalition government has radically reformed our development spend by focussing resources on a smaller number of countries and agencies, helping economies to stand on their own two feet and setting up an independent watchdog to scrutinise spending and root out waste.'"

After five weeks in which ratings plummeted by 2.5million, Monday’s episode appears to have turned a corner, attracting 5.8million viewers, one million more than the previous instalment. Although the ITV drama has been accused of taking liberties with its depiction of police investigations and court proceedings, fans appear to have embraced the chaos, prompting the spike in ratings. Broadchurch, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman, seems to have turned a corner in the ratings However, it is still not being given an easy ride, with viewers questioning the accuracy of how it portrayed the medical condition of one of its main characters. With David Tennant’s downtrodden police detective going into hospital to have a pacemaker fitted, it was meant to be a dramatic highlight in the middle of the series. And with the character updating his will, warning his former wife he might die and even experiencing an eerie dream sequence while under the knife, the sense of jeopardy was markedly ramped up. But audiences did not have quite the reaction that would have been hoped for, pointing out medical inaccuracies and claiming that the procedure is not as dangerous as viewers were led to believe. One wrote: ‘Wife been yelling at the TV. Oi, Broadchurch you don’t have a general anaesthetic for a pacemaker fitting. Wife does it for a living.’ And another pointed out: ‘Oh Broadchurch, having a pacemaker put in is NOT that big a deal. My 80 year old mom was a better patient than you, Hardy.’ A third placed it in a long line of criticisms that has seen the programme’s second series rounded on by lawyers, who have taken issue with the portrayal of court proceedings. Law-student Rachel Constable tweeted: ‘Oh dear. I have a horrible feeling that pacemaker patients are about to be misrepresented as much as the legal system is!’ Despite these concerns, the episode was the most watched since the second series began last month. Monday’s episode marked a significant jump after what had been a steady period of decline throughout the hit show’s second run. There are risks associated with having a pacemaker fitted, including infections and blood clots. However, while it can be used to treat serious conditions, the procedure itself is seen as relatively safe, with some patients even allowed home on the same day as their surgery."

Crowds demonstrated in Los Angeles, California on Monday, June 15 over the Iran election results. ""I am absolutely convinced that what we are witnessing is a turning point in the history of the Islamic Republic,"" said Dr. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York City. ""Even if the Islamic Republic survives this crisis, it will no longer be as it used to be,"" added Dabashi. The contentious election results between conservative incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and reformist challenger Mir Hossein Moussavi sent many Iranians protesting in the streets, while others celebrated Ahmadinejad's apparent victory. Kaveh Afrasiabi, who has taught at Tehran University and Boston University and identifies himself as an independent, told CNN that Ahmadinejad's widespread support in rural areas and small towns was the reason for his win. In results announced hours after the polls closed, Ahmadinejad received more than 62 percent of the vote, a figure hotly disputed by Moussavi's supporters. With the credibility of Friday's election under scrutiny, how the Islamic Republic of Iran overcomes it and reclaims its legitimacy in the eyes of some of its own citizens and the international community remains to be seen. ""There is good reason to believe that many if not most of the pro-Moussavi demonstrators are gladly taking an opportunity to safely protest something bigger: their enormous discontent with the entire system as it stands,"" said Shirin Sadeghi, a Middle East analyst for the Huffington Post. The unstable political, social and economic climate has some scholars questioning the future of the Islamic Republic. ""They are either going to crack down severely or they are going to cave in -- it could go either way,"" Dabashi said of the conservatives who now dominate Iran's government. Many Iranian-Americans say they see this as their opportunity for change. ""This is the best chance Iranians have to evolve to a better situation,"" said Dr. Ali Nayeri, a professor at the University of California at Irvine. That chance has sparked an unprecedented wave of spontaneous demonstrations not only within Iran but also thousands of miles away from Tehran --- scenes unparalleled since the 1979 revolution. ""Thirty years ago we had the war with Iraq. Now we have an internal war with our president and the fundamentalists,"" said Reza Goharzad, a political analyst who worked with Moussavi when he was prime minister of Iran. Goharzad, of Southern California, was among thousands of voters to cast an absentee ballot. ""This was the first time I voted in 30 years,"" said Goharzad. The enthusiasm that drove record numbers of Iranian-Americans to the voting booths was overshadowed by disappointment when a shortage of ballots prevented hundreds from voting. In addition, the election results were announced before many of the voting booths in the U.S. had closed. Alex Vatanka, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Jane's, a provider of defense and security information, said Iran's supreme ruler, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, may have miscalculated the mood of the country when he endorsed Ahmadinejad's victory before the country's election authority made the final call.  Khamenei has since asked the authority, the Guardian Council, to recount some of the votes. But Moussavi is asking for fresh elections. Goharzad, like many other voters, questions the legitimacy of the election. He wants to know where his vote went. A student activist in Dallas, Texas, echoed that sentiment. ""The election volunteer at my voting location said that they had 500 ballots, which was not enough for the thousand or so people that turned out to vote,"" said the activist, who wanted to remain anonymous because he plans to visit Iran soon. For the first time, Iranian-Americans say, the post-revolution generation has seen the power of their unity unfold in masses. They say this has given Iranians at home and abroad hope that reform could be within their reach, if the ruling mullahs are willing to allow it. ""We are seeing a rise of a new generation of Iranians who are not taking it anymore,"" said Dabashi. ""This is no longer just about this election, this is full-fledged civil disobedience,"" he added. The divide within the Islamic Republic has pitted the reformists against the conservatives. ""The big difference between these protests and the student riots of 1999 and 2001 is that we are seeing senior caliber officials like Mir Hossein Moussavi,  Mehdi Karrubi and Mohammad Khatami and Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani supporting the demonstrations,"" said Vatanka. Karrubi is a former Parliament speaker. Khatami and Rafsanjani are former presidents. Some experts say where Iran is headed actually has a lot to do with its past. ""Rafsanjani made no secret of his disdain for Ahmadinejad ahead of the election, and even back in 2005 when he lost the second round runoff to Ahmadinejad,"" said Sadeghi. Rafsanjani is chairman of the Assembly of Experts and oversees the 86-member body, which is responsible for appointing the supreme leader and monitoring his performance. Behind closed doors, Iran's political parties are caught in the middle of a power struggle between Supreme Leader Khamenei and Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani's role as chairman of the assembly gives him the ability to influence that body's attitudes toward Khamenei, Vatanka said. That could only add more fuel to the political fire and social unrest in the streets, analysts say. Politics aside, at the end of the day, Iranian expatriates such as Mitra Gholami, who participated in the historic 1979 protests, feel a sense of deja vu. Gholami, now an Atlanta resident, fled Iran with her three children 15 years ago. ""I want people to have a normal life,"" said Gholami. ""I want them to have freedom."""

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said a portion of the £500million being given to hospitals over the next two years to ease A&E pressures would go towards paying consultants to work out-of-hours. At nearly all A&E units in England consultants go home between 8pm and midnight, leaving patients in the hands of junior doctors supervised by one or two more experienced medics. The Mail revealed yesterday that only five NHS trusts in England employ a consultant to work after midnight in their casualty department. Although there is a designated on-call consultant who can be contacted in an emergency after they have gone home, Mr Hunt accepted this system needed to be ‘beefed up’. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘About a quarter of the £500million the Prime Minister announced is going towards increasing consultant cover.’ Labour suggested the problem could be eased by allowing hospitals to advertise abroad to fill consultant posts. Currently they are banned from recruiting from overseas until they have tried to fill vacancies from within this country. Mr Hunt unveiled plans to help hospitals cope with the increase in those turning up at A&E and an expected surge in sick patients this winter. Fifty-three NHS trusts whose A&E units are understaffed or lack beds will be given a total of £250million, while around £62million will go towards extra staffing including paying consultants to work evenings and weekends. Care of elderly and other vulnerable patients at home will be improved to prevent them needing to go to A&E, and ambulances could be turned into mobile casualty units with patients diagnosed, treated and even dropped off back at home.

The 31-year-old, who has scored ten goals in as many games for club side Paris Saint-Germain, was on fire once again as Roy Hodgson's men were swept away. The Swedish skipper had given his side a 20th minute lead before goals from Manchester United's Danny Welbeck and Tottenham's Steven Caulker gave England a half-time. Ibrahimovic arrival marks watershed moment for Paris Saint-Germain But it was Ibrahimovic who stole the show after the interval, with three strikes in the final 12 minutes. After netting a 78th minute equaliser, Ibrahimovic slammed home a rasping 30-yard free-kick before rounding off his night with a scarcely believable scissors kick. It ruined the night for England captain Steven Gerrard, who had hoped to celebrate his 100th cap with victory. Gerrard told ITV 1: ""I still stick by Zinedine Zidane, he is the best player in the world as the best player of his generation, but his (Ibrahimovic's) performance was world class and he just scored one of the best goals I seen live. ""It was his night. If someone scores four goals and the way he scored them....it's one of the best I've seen."" Hodgson added: ""The fourth goal was extraordinary, but it was the second and third goals which cost us. ""For 70 minutes we were playing very well and we deserved to be in the lead, but we made changes and they took the initiative."" Elsewhere, France recorded an impressive 2-1 victory over Italy after it came from behind in Parma. Milan star Stephan El Shaarway gave the hosts the lead only for France to hit back through Mathieu Valbuena and Bafetimbi Gomis.

Messi passes Pele's goal milestone Lionel Messi drew a rare blank after Argentina was held to a goalless draw by Saudi Arabia. Despite boasting the likes of Sergio Aguero and Angel Di Maria in their starting line-up, Argentina were unable to make the breakthrough against a stubborn Saudi defence. Mikkel Diskerud scored a late equalizer as the U.S. grabbed a 2-2 draw in Russia. Fyodor Smolov had given the hosts a ninth minute lead before Michael Bradley's fine effort brought the U.S. level. Roman Shirokov looked to have won the contest with an 84th minute penalty but Diskerud fired home late on to ensure the game finished level.

But one family was left ‘deeply traumatised’ when a Brazilian wandering spider was delivered to their South London home – by Waitrose. The lethal arachnid had been hiding in bananas when drivers dropped off the online groceries. Scroll down for video And although dad Tim managed to trap the beast, it ripped off its own leg to escape, sparking a tense hunt as the couple and their two sons, aged seven and eight, fled the house. They were so terrified they couldn’t even spend the night in their own home once the spider had been captured. Tim, who declined to give his surname, said: ‘Although people might think these things are funny, I keep thinking that the spider could have killed me or my son if he had gone to get a banana.’ The Brazilian wandering spider has caused 14 reported deaths, and although an antidote to its powerful neurotoxin has been developed, one pest control expert claimed there was no anti-venom in the UK. Guy’s Hospital in London held stocks, but they expired in 2011. Tim had been cooking breakfast when the supermarket van dropped off their order last weekend. Just as he was unpacking the bananas, he spotted the spider, and, in shock, dropped the bunch into a fruit bowl, trapping the beast by one of its legs. Tim said he had been cooking breakfast when the Waitrose van dropped his shopping off. When the spider was removed they discovered a sac of eggs containing thousands of babies He took photographs and went online to identify it – discovering it was of a species the Guinness Book of Records calls the world’s most venomous. Tim said: ‘We were terrified. We got ourselves and our kids out of the house straight away.’ He and his wife Lisa called both the supermarket and the RSPCA, which said it was unable to handle such a dangerous animal and advised them to call 999. But police said they, too, could not deal with the spider – whose Greek scientific name translates as ‘murderess’ and whose venom can kill in two hours – and suggested a pest control expert. Waitrose sent a pest expert down to tackle the spider, which he described as 'hardcore' - the creature was eventually locked inside three separate boxes Meanwhile, a Waitrose worker arrived, armed with just a freezer bag to trap the lethal spider. They went into the kitchen and discovered the creature had disappeared, leaving only its trapped leg behind. Tim said: ‘We had no idea where it had gone.’ And when the Waitrose worker lifted up the bananas, they spotted a sac containing hundreds of spider eggs. It was then that they decided to evacuate the house. Waitrose sent pest expert Steve Trippett to track down the spider he described as ‘hardcore’. He disposed of the eggs – putting them in a freezer to kill them – and, armed with a 3ft stick found the creature at the bottom of the fruit bowl. Rather than scuttling away, the spider became aggressive, standing on its back legs and showing its fangs. Undeterred, Mr Trippett used his stick to manoeuvre it into a heavy plastic box, which was then placed inside two other boxes. It is understood the spider was then taken to a scientific centre abroad. Tim said his family were ‘too traumatised to remain in the house’ so spent the night with friends. Waitrose said: ‘The safety of our customers is our absolute priority. ‘We did everything we could to look after our customer during what was a distressing incident and we’ve apologised personally. Although this is highly unusual, we’re taking it very seriously and will be working with our supplier to minimise the risk of this happening again.’ The supermarket offered the family £150 of shopping vouchers and a family day out in compensation. This is the latest of several incidents of the species finding its way to Britain – which experts say could be down to the trend for organic fruits not treated with chemicals that could kill the spiders. Last month a woman in Essex found eggs in bananas she bought from Tesco. She had to incinerate her vacuum cleaner after using it to clean them up. In March, a family evacuated their Staffordshire home after finding hundreds of hatchlings. Last November, a Tesco store in Kent had to close for several hours after a Brazilian wandering spider was found under a box of bananas. In the same month, a family had their London house fumigated after they bought infested bananas from Sainsbury’s."

But the family of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani has steadfastly denied that she played any role in her husband's death -- and a human rights organization that is trying to help Ashtiani called the program ""a theatrical melodrama."" ""There was a complete disregard for due process, bringing her out and making her a part of this theatrical melodrama is an attempt to try to convince the international public opinion that she is guilty,"" said Hadi Ghaemi, director of International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. Iran has drawn sharp criticism from the international community after Ashtiani's 2010 sentence to death by stoning. Officials ranging from Pope Benedict XVI to the European Union's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, urged Iran not to carry out the sentence. ""Since the international outcry, the Iranian government is tap-dancing, trying to justify executing her,"" said Ghaemi. Press TV, Iran's government-backed English language station, aired the half-hour special on ""Iran Today."" The program included interviews with -- among others -- Ashtiani and her son. The program brought Ashtiani back to her home in Osku ""to produce a visual account"" of the death of her husband ""at the crime scene."" ""This is highly unusual because according to Iranian authorities this is a woman who is in prison convicted of adultery and murder and now she has apparently been plucked out of her jail cell and featured in this documentary,"" said CNN's Reza Sayah ""This was a program designed to promote the government's position,"" said Sayah. This is not the first time Ashtiani has been brought out in front of cameras for an alleged confession. The program also condemns the public campaign to free her. ""It was a very disturbing piece, it was the Iranian government turning a judicial case into a public relations case,"" said Ghaemi. Press TV's release of still photographs of Ashtiani and her son from the interview, which took place on Sunday, fueled some speculation that they had been released, but there was no evidence or confirmation to support that conjecture. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006. She also received a 10 year prison sentence for her alleged cooperation in the plot to kill her husband. ""The key point here is not just about Ashtiani, but about abolishing stoning in Iran. That is what the Iranian government is trying to diverge attention from. They don't want to talk about abolishing stoning or Iran's human rights record,"" said Ghaemi. Two German journalists who interviewed Ashtiani were arrested in October and charged with espionage. Ashtiani's son and lawyer also were arrested, but it was not clear on what charges."

Holidaymakers jetting off to Malta from the UK claim they were told they would not be allowed to check in hold luggage without signing the document. And they allege that when they arrived at Malta International Airport from Stansted in Essex on Wednesday, their suitcases were damaged. Scroll down for video New demands: Ryanair is allegedly forcing passengers flying from Stansted to Malta to sign a waiver Declaration: The ticket that was stuck on to passengers luggage from Ryanair The passengers claim they were told the system was introduced because of a surge in incidents at Malta International Airport. And they said Ryanair slapped a bright green sticker on their luggage - in a bid to cut down on any potential lawsuits arising from damaged bags. The tag that was stuck on passengers' bags reads: ‘Limited release. Carriers participating in the transport of this item may not accept claims resulting from the above conditions of acceptance. ‘This is not the Luggage Ticket (Baggage Check) described in Article 4 of the Warsaw Convention.’ One traveller, a 27-year-old marketing specialist from London, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I couldn't believe what they were forcing me to sign. I'm away for two weeks - of course I'm going to have hold luggage. No claim: Passengers were told to sign a document stating they wouldn't sue the airline for damaged luggage ‘When I picked up my Samsonite suitcase in Malta it had been badly scratched and part of the case had cracked. ‘Those bags are designed to be tough, so for something to crack it like that must have involved a heck of a lot of force.’ Another passenger on the same flight also reported their bag had been damaged. He said: ‘There were a lot of angry faces around the carousel, so I think most of the passengers had something bad happen to their bag. ‘A bottle of aftershave was smashed and has leaked all over my clothes, and now I can't claim against Ryanair. My holiday is ruined.’ Forced to sign: Passengers on board the flight from Essex to Malta were asked to sign the disclaimer Officials from Malta International Airport have also hit out at Ryanair for forcing passengers to sign the disclaimer, because they have had no complaints about their handling of luggage. Joe Bugeja, chief operations officer GlobeGround Malta Limited, the company that handles Ryanair luggage at the airport, said they had no knowledge of this new policy before they saw the stickers. A spokesman for Malta International Airport added: ‘We reaffirm that this is a handling function of GlobeGround Malta. ‘Nevertheless, we shall be seeking clarification from Ryanair accordingly.’ Ryanair released a statement but declined to comment on any individual situation. The statement read: 'If a customer is travelling with a bag that has any damage (minor/major) they are requested to complete a limited release tag so we can identify that the bag had been previously damaged prior to carriage on board a Ryanair flight.

Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were both granted appeals by Belfast High Court today, with Murphy set for a civil retrial. Daly could also face similar proceedings. While Murphy and Daly were successful, challenges lodged by convicted Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt and fellow senior republican Liam Campbell over their liability for the attack were dismissed by a panel of three judges. While no one has been successfully convicted criminally for the 1998 bombing, all four men were held responsible in a landmark civil action taken by some of the families two years ago. Outside court Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan was killed, said he accepted the findings of the appeal court but insisted he would see the retrial process through. 'We are disappointed, we have to accept the ruling of the court, which we do, but we are disappointed,' he said. 'It has been a long struggle for the families, almost 10 years, it looks like this work will continue for a number of years forward. 'It is not something that we look forward to but if we feel it is the right thing to do we will continue to do that.' Stanley McCombe, who lost his wife Ann, said: 'We will fight on to the bitter end.' Continuing their fight: Michael Gallagher, right, Stanley McCombe, centre, and his son Clive said they were 'disappointed' but would 'fight to the bitter end' He said he accepted it was unlikely anyone would ever be jailed for the attack and reiterated family demands for a cross-border public inquiry into the bombing and the subsequent police investigation. 'It has taken us a long time to get here, all we are asking for is the truth,' he said. Lord Justice Malachy Higgins heard the appeal in January with fellow Lord Justices Paul Girvan and Patrick Coghlin. Delivering their reserved ruling to the court, Lord Justice Higgins directed a retrial of the claims against Murphy, from Dundalk, Co Louth, and said the court would hear arguments on a potential retrial of Daly, from Cullaville, Co Monaghan, in the autumn. The three judges questioned evidence surrounding emails from US undercover agent David Rupert in allowing Murphy's appeal. 'The paucity of the email evidence, the lack of consistency in the emails or at least ambiguity, the possibility of initials referring to someone other than Murphy and the fact that they refer on occasions to double hearsay considerably weakened the emails as evidence,' they said. ""The judge's (Mr Justice Morgan's) conclusion that it was cogent evidence is not sustainable."" Dismissed: Challenges lodged by Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, left, and fellow senior republican Liam Campbell over their liability for the attack were rejected by the panel of three judges. On Daly, they said Mr Justice Morgan appeared to have taken into account evidence that should have been excluded and seemed to have given weight to inadmissible evidence of a past conviction. 'Accordingly, his appeal will be allowed,' they said. Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, died when the Real IRA car bomb ripped through the Co Tyrone market town in August 1998. More than 200 were injured in the blast. In Belfast High Court two years ago, Mr Justice Declan Morgan, now Northern Ireland's Lord Chief Justice, found the four men liable and ordered them to pay £1.6 million in compensation. A separate bid by the families for that award to be increased was also rejected by the appeal court today. Atrocity: 29 people, including a woman who was pregnant with twins, were killed in the attack during August 1998 Not all the bereaved relatives have backed the legal challenge and Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died, said it had been a waste of time and money. 'At the end of the day it does not matter if the people are found guilty or not. They are not going to serve one minute (in jail),'he said. 'With regards to compensation, people will not get any money, it is a waste of time.' Only one man has so far faced a criminal trial over the outrage. In December 2007 Sean Hoey, from Jonesborough, South Armagh, was cleared at Belfast Crown Court of murdering the 29 people. He was acquitted of 58 charges, including some not directly linked to the bombing."

Having by his own admission caused a 'great furore' by declaring that shale gas exploration should take place in the 'desolate' North East, Lord Howell corrected himself. He said he meant the North West - sparking a fresh round of derision. Controversy: Lord Howell of Guildford said fracking could go ahead in the North East because it was inhabitable, but now insists he meant the North West The Tory peer had told the House of Lords that 'beautiful rural areas' of the South should be spared from the controversial drilling. Instead there were 'large, uninhabited and desolate areas' of the North East where there was 'plenty of room for fracking'. His comments in the House of Lords drew gasps of astonishment – and immediate condemnation. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby tweeted: ‘North east England very beautiful, rugged, welcoming, inspiring, historic, advancing, not “desolate” as was said in House of Lords today.’ But the former Energy Secretary now insists that what was on his mind when he made the incendiary remark was 'drilling going on off the Lancashire coast' - in the North West. 'It came out of my mouth as the North East, which you can blame me for rightly,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged Lord Howell to keep quiet. 'I have a simple bit of advice for Lord Howell, which is when you are in a hole, stop fracking,' he said on his weekly LBC 97.3 phone-in. Labour's shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry lambasted the peer for implying it just wanted fracking to happen 'somewhere a long way from Surrey'. Journalist Mark Ferguson tweeted a picture of Lancashire, adding: 'OI! Lord Howell. This is Lancashire. It’s not #desolate! But it’s all “up there” to some people eh?' Cuadrilla has drilled exploratory wells in Lancashire which is thought to be plentiful in natural gas - but the activity has been blamed for two small earthquakes in the area. Lord Howell, father of the Chancellor's wife Frances, said he had made a 'stupid error' by mentioning any location, because fracking needed to be 'far away from residences in unloved places that are not environmentally sensitive' - unlike wind farms which he blamed for 'terrible desecration' of the landscape. However he added: 'It's odd that they've decided to do this exploring in sensitive places down in Sussex.' Downing Street distanced itself from Lord Howell on Tuesday when the row erupted. Michael Fallon, the Tory energy minister, said there was 'exciting' potential for shale gas in the 'north, south, east and west'. Ministers said that the South could become 'the second biggest area of shale in Britain'. But Mr Clegg suggested that Tories include Mr Osborne and David Cameron were getting 'overexcited' about its potential benefits. He warned it would be 'difficult' to persuade local communities to accept fracking near their homes. Mr Clegg added: 'At the moment we are in a very early stage of all of this. My own hunch is that people are getting a little bit overexcited about how much gas is going to be yielded in a short period of time through fracking.' Yesterday the daughter of singer Chrissie Hynde was arrested at anti-fracking protests. Environmental activist Natalie Hynde, 30, had 'superglued' herself to the entrance of a rural drilling site earmarked for potential fracking in West Sussex. The site in Balcombe has become a focal point for communities concerned about the process. But yesterday Energy Minister Michael Fallon said that 'towns, villages and countryside' could all be targeted for drilling if gas were discovered, no matter their location or beauty. Determined: Natalie Hynde superglued herself to Simon 'Sitting Bull' Medhurst to create a 'human lock' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance Removed: Ms Hynde and her partner Mr Medhurst were arrested following the stunt at a protest against fracking planned for a site in Balcombe, West Sussex So far, 25 protesters have been held by police in Balcombe. Arrested alongside Miss Hynde - the daughter of the Kinks' Ray Davies and the Pretenders star - was her boyfriend, eco-warrior Simon 'Sitting Bull' Medhurst, 55. They had glued their hands together in a 'human lock' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance at around 8.30am. A row of police officers acted as a human shield to hold back protesters while negotiating with the pair for more than two hours. They were eventually freed using glue thinner and were still in custody last night. They had set up camp opposite the main entrance to the gate. Fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel. Mr Fallon warned the village would not be the only site in the South that could see drilling, if the country is to benefit from a gas bonanza. He added the South could become 'the second biggest area of shale in Britain' and communities could benefit financially. In June, a British Geological Survey claimed there may be more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the North of England alone.

Alberto Pizango, a leader of the protesters, says his followers did not kill police officers. Police and indigenous protesters said separately that at least eight police and 22 protesters died. The clash took place at dawn outside the northern province of Bagua in the Department of Amazonas as police attempted to break up a roadblock on the 59th day of protests. Foreign Minister Jose A. Garcia Belaunde told CNN en Español that the state of emergency was ordered to give the government the opportunity to re-establish order and reopen talks with the protesters. Under the state of emergency, the army can be called on to maintain order. ""Look, the use of force is legitimate,"" he said. ""Today, what we have received in response were gunshots -- directed at police helicopters, killing eight or nine police."" But Alberto Pizango, the principal leader of the indigenous group, said his followers could not have been responsible for killing any police, because they were armed only with stones and arrows. He said the demonstrators had been pursuing a peaceful protest. Authorities have not confirmed the number of civilian deaths. The director general of the police, Jose Sanchez Farfan, said government buildings in Bagua had been looted and set aflame. Though a congressional commission has recommended the repeal of the laws rejected by the native communities, President Alan Garcia supports those that allow using the lands, maintaining that the richness of the Amazon belongs to all Peruvians and that a significant percentage of natural areas are already protected. ""These people don't have crowns,"" he said about the protesters. ""These people aren't first-class citizens who can say -- 400,000 natives to 28 million Peruvians -- 'You don't have the right to be here.' No way. That is a huge error."" Garcia called Pizango a criminal. Several days ago, Garcia announced an arrest warrant had been issued for Pizango, who is accused of inciting his followers to violence.

Dotting the sphere were 300 Chanel flags representing each of the fashion house's boutiques around the world. Creative director Lagerfeld said 'the spirit of the show was Chanel's globalisation'. They've expanded around the world since the first boutique was opened in the Normandy seaside town of Deauville by the legendary Coco Chanel a century ago. But the show was surely also a celebration of the German-born designer. He celebrates three decades at the creative helm this year, during which he's overseen the transformation of the house into a truly global empire. Scroll down for video Peek-a-boo!

When I started we had three or four (boutiques) 30 years ago,' said Lagerfeld. 'But it's not an ego trip.'' The show's 79 varied looks brimmed with ideas, classic and new, and showed that the designer is still a creative force to be reckoned with. Models, including Cara Delevingne and Stella Tennant, walked around the circular globe runway sporting stylish new winter concepts in tones of predominantly black, blue and grey with splashes of pink, purple and metallics. Biker chic: Thigh-high boots with chains, choker necklaces and black gloves featured in the Paris Fashion Week show Wrapped up: The furry hats came in pastel colours to contrast the dark coats and suits Modern twist: Re-workings of the classic Little Black Dress that Coco Chanel was famous for 21st century update: Other classic Chanel touches were present including jackets with frayed seams and tweed suits while zip up leather leg sheaths - starting at the thigh and ending at the ankle - were a new invention Accompanied by classical music that morphed into Daft Punk's 'Around the World' the models showcased the Autumn/Winter 13/14 collection which includes 'peek-a-boo' coats with folded back sleeves and hems. Biker chic was also prevalent with chained over the knee boots, black gloves and furry helmet style hats. Numerous models also wore zip up leather leg sheaths - like leggings that start at the thigh and end at the ankle. Modern re-workings of some of Chanel's classic looks including the LBD and skirt-suits ensured the core clientele weren't left behind. The models' hair was kept simple and loose, at times chain choker necklaces were worn over long locks, while the make-up included glittery silver eyeliner. Ready for winter: Black and greys with hints of colour were seen on the runway Celeb support: Milla Jovovich, left, and Jessica Chastain sat on the front row and met creative designer Karl Lagerfeld after the show A-listers on the front row included Oscar nominated actress Jessica Chastain and model-turned actress Milla Jovovich. Milla praised Lagerfeld's wintry collection. 'It's romantic. I loved the coats. It's early 20th-century Coco, but he's made it uber-modern,' she said. Despite turning 80 this year, Lagerfeld, who took a turn orbiting the globe at the end of the show, said he has no plans to slow down and hopes to continue Chanel's global expansion. 'Look,' he said pointing at an empty part of the globe. 'There is still space left.'"

Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, was one of an estimated 500 Britons who went to Syria to fight for the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS). The group has renamed itself Islamic State (IS), and now controls vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared as the world’s newest Islamic caliphate. This weekend, the U.S. bombed key IS targets in northern Iraq as the group threatened to wipe out a secretive sect known as the Yazidis, accusing them of being devil worshippers. Rahman, from Portsmouth, was shot dead in a gun fight a fortnight ago, a day before the Muslim festival if Eid, said his family. His father, Abdul Hannan, 52, an Indian restaurant worker, said the family received a text message from a friend of Rahman in Syria who informed them that their son was dead. The latest killing brings the death toll of British jihadists in Syria to 19, according to terrorism experts at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King’s College, London, which monitors the war in Syria. Rahman is the second British jihadist from Portsmouth to die in Syria. The first was his friend Iftekhar Jaman, 23, who died in December. Rahman’s father, Mr Hannan, said that Jaman went to Syria first at the beginning of last year, and then took his son there by contacting him through social media. He said that Rahman did not tell any member of his family that he was going to Syria, but suddenly disappeared from Portsmouth. Days later, they received a call from him saying he was in Syria. Mr Hannan said: ‘He asked us to pray for him, and said he wanted to become a shaheed (martyr) for the sake of Allah.’ It is not known where in Syria Rahman died. But Shiraz Maher, a terrorism expert at the ICSR, said he spoke to Rahman on social media a month ago, when he said he was in the northern Syria city of Deir Zour, which is a stronghold for IS. Maher said: ‘From speaking to him, I got the sense that he was a man who wanted to become a martyr. He was a man of conviction.’ Rahman was working at his local Primark store, but was dismissed a month before he went to Syria last October. Friends: Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, and  Iftekhar Jaman, 23, who died in December Rahman, from Portsmouth, was shot dead in a gun fight a fortnight ago according to his family He was one of 10 Britons from Portsmouth – all of Bangladeshi origin – who have gone to Syria to join the Islamic State. Rahman flew to Turkey with five other friends, and then crossed the border by land into Syria. In May, Mashudur Choudhury, 31, who accompanied Rahman, but returned to the UK, became the first person in the UK to be convicted of taking part in terrorist activity in Syria. He was arrested in October at Gatwick airport by anti-terrorist police, as he flew back from Turkey. It emerged that Choudhury found the training in Syria too difficult and became scared of the fighting. Choudhury will be sentenced on September 19 at Kingston Crown Court."

Luiz was roundly criticised for his display as Brazil were thumped 7-0 by Germany in the World Cup semis The former Chelsea defender's display in that match saw him earn a lot of criticism which was further compounded by the five-time tournament winners 3-0 capitulation against Holland in the third-place play-off encounter.

Layne Morris of Utah and Tabitha Speer of North Carolina filed their lawsuit Friday in federal court in Utah against Omar Khadr, who signed a plea deal in 2010 that he committed five war crimes, including the killing of U.S. soldier Christopher Speer, in 2002. As part of the deal, Khadr admitted to throwing the grenade that killed Speer and injured other soldiers, including Morris, who lost sight in one eye from the shrapnel, the lawsuit states. The Toronto-born Khadr is serving the remainder of his eight-year sentence in Canada. Lawsuit: In this file photo, Tabitha Speer, widow of Sgt. 1st Class Chris Speer, is seen next to former sergeant Layne Morris Morris and Tabitha Speer are concerned that Khadr might get his hands on money from a $20 million wrongful imprisonment lawsuit he filed against the Canadian government, said Don Winder, a Salt Lake City-based attorney who is representing them. 'We don't know if he'll ever have any money, but we need to make sure that we're doing the right thing and the principles are right,' Winder said, noting that Morris is dealing with his injuries and Tabitha Speer is raising two children without any income from her husband. The lawsuit seeks damages for Speer's wrongful death and distress to Speer for suffering from his injuries before dying, in addition to damages for Morris and his wife. It wasn't immediately clear if any similar lawsuits have been filed against other detainees at Guantanamo, the U.S. naval base in Cuba. Prisoner: Omar Khadr, seen in this file artists' rendering, pleaded guilty to committing five war crimes when he was 15 Widow: In this file photo, Tabitha Speer, widow of Sgt. 1st Class Chris Speer,  speaks to reporters on the sentencing of Khadr at his military commission at Guantanamo Bay It's unclear if Khadr has an attorney in the Utah lawsuit. Dennis Edney, a Canadian attorney who has represented Khadr, did not return messages from The Associated Press. He has said the facts of the plea deal are false and Khadr signed it so he could return to Canada. Khadr's military trial drew criticism because he was captured at age 15 and seriously wounded during a four-hour battle at an Afghanistan al-Qaida compound in 2002. Khadr's lawyers and human rights groups contended he was groomed to be 'child soldier' and should have been sent home for rehabilitation. They said Speer died in a battlefield killing that did not amount to a war crime. Khadr was prohibited under the deal from calling witnesses at his sentencing hearing who would support defense claims that he was a 'child soldier,' forced into fighting the U.S. by a radical father who was an associate of Osama bin Laden. 'The fact that the trial of a child soldier, Omar Khadr, has ended with a guilty plea in exchange for his eventual release to Canada does not change the fact that fundamental principles of law and due process were long since abandoned in Omar's case,' Edney said in 2010. Military prosecutors in the case portrayed Khadr as a dangerous terrorist. Khadr spent 10 years at Guantanamo, and was transferred to Canada in 2012 to serve the remainder of his sentence."

Reports say the firearms instructor thought his handgun contained blanks when he shot a man in the arm A firearms instructor has accidentally shot a student during a gun-safety class in Ohio - the second time he has shot someone by mistake. Shooting range master Terry Dunlap, 73, shot Michael Piemonte in the arm when he accidentally fired a .38 caliber handgun. The bullet first hit a desk at a shooting association training centre, ricocheted off and embedded in his arm. News of the accident has angered another former Dunlap student, Cathy Schmelzer, 50, who was also shot accidentally by the instructor. She told Disptach.com that when she was 14, she was shot in the leg by Dunlap when he fired his weapon to scare his daughter and friends during a Halloween 'haunted hay ride' on his property in Fairfield County, Ohio, US. Dunlap was a police department auxiliary lieutenant at the time, and reports said he thought the gun was loaded with blanks. On reading the latest Dunlap firearms error, Ms Schmelzer, of Prairie Township, Columbus, Ohio, was alarmed that the instructor had done it again. Quoted by the news service, she questioned: 'He’s supposed to be teaching classes and he doesn’t know there’s a live bullet in there?' No criminal or departmental actions were taken against Dunlap because the shooting was deemed accidental, Dispatch.com said. Fairfield County Sheriff, Dave Phalen, told the news service a decision had not yet been made on whether to charge Dunlap for the latest August 10 shooting. The accident happened towards the end of a 12-hour day of training in gun handling and safety, according to Dispatch.com. Weapon: Dunlap thought his .38 handgun contained blanks, reports say, when he fired it and hit a pupil in the arm Dunlap is qualified to teach classes for Ohioans who are getting their concealed-carry permits. The shooting occurred at the Carroll-based home of the Central Ohio Coonhunters Association Inc., in Fairfield County. Victim Mr Piemonte, 26, of Pataskala, Ohio, told the news service he felt 'torn' about what had happened. On the one hand he said Dunlap was a good instructor, whose class had been 'very informative' and 'well laid out'. On the other hand he pointed out that he got shot, but said he and his wife, who was also in the class, had forgiven Dunlap and keep him in their prayers. Dunlap was formerly a Pickerington police department captain and later served as the community’s safety-service director. He is one of five directors of the Central Ohio Coonhunters Association, in Carroll, Ohio - a hunting and wildlife conservation group founded in 1968. The 73-year-old is also a Violet Township trustee and is seeking re-election in November. Read more here: Accidental shooting was not first for firearms instructor"

So how does one half of the world's most powerful A-list couples, mother to four young children and head of a burgeoning fashion empire stay healthy? The former Spice Girl has finally shared her secret - and it's bound to cause a buzz. What's her secret? Victoria Beckham has just hit her 40th birthday and has revealed her favourite new health superfood as bee pollen A prolific tweeter, the former popstar tweeted her love of her favourite healthy food supplement: bee pollen. While the majority of us were devouring our leftover Easter eggs on Bank Holiday Monday, Victoria tweeted to her 7.46m followers: 'Totally obsessed with this Bee pollen! so good for u!! X vb'. Bee pollen, which is made by honeybees and priced at around £3.50 for 50g, is usually taken in granule form and you can sprinkle it onto salads or smoothies. It is widely considered one of nature's most complete nourishing superfoods because it contains nearly all of the nutrients required to function by humans, including amino acids, B-complex, and folic acid. New obsession: Victoria, who last weekend celebrated her 40th birthday, tweeted about her love for bee pollen, which she described as being 'so good for you' It is said that bee pollen boosts energy levels, can be used topically to soothe skin conditions, curbs cravings and even acts as an aphrodisiac. What does it do? Bee pollen, which can be sprinkled onto salad or into smoothies, is said to boost energy levels, curb cravings and act as an aphrodisiac Katy Mason, Nutritionist at NutriCentre.com, said: 'Bee pollen is the pollen collected by bees from flowers; if you look closely at bees in the summer you may see little yellow balls collected on their legs, this is bee pollen which the bee is gathering to take back to the hive. 'These little pellets of bee pollen can then be harvested by bee keepers from the hive and taken to supplement the diet. 'Bee pollen is known for its rich and varied nutritional properties, it is high in proteins, amino acids, vitamins and folic acid. 'It is unique in that it is high in nutrients other products of animal origin don't possess. For example, bee pollen contains more amino acids gram for gram than beef, eggs or cheese. 'It can help increase energy due to the high B vitamin content and includes large amounts of rutin, an antioxidant that helps strengthen capillaries and blood vessels, which can support the cardiovascular system. 'Bee pollen contains all the nutrients we need; it is a wonderful vegetarian source of protein and contains all of the B vitamins, including vitamin B12 which can be hard to find in vegetarian sources.' Susan Curtis, Natural Health Director of Neal’s Yard Remedies, adds: 'Bee pollen is one of nature's most completely nourishing foods, with nearly all the nutrients required by humans. 'It has been used for energy and endurance since ancient times, with a single pellet containing over 2 million nutrient-packed flower pollen granule.' Looking good: Clearly the bee pollen is working wonders; Victoria arrived back from LA after her birthday celebrations looking younger than ever 1. Energy booster: Full of carbohydrates, protein (50 per cent) and B vitamins, it enhances stamina and fights off fatigue 2. Soothing: It can be used topically to treat psoriasis or eczema 3. Immune system booster: According to holistic health expert Dr. Joseph Mercola, bee pollen has antibiotic-type properties, which apparently protect the body from contracting viruses 4. Addiction treatment: Has been used holistically for years to help heal addictions and curb cravings by suppressing impulses 5. Infertility problems: Bee pollen may help women get pregnant because it stimulates and restores ovarian function, is a hormonal booster and an aphrodisiac How much should you take? Katy Mason explains: 'Bee pollen can be made up of up to 40 per cent protein so one teaspoon of bee pollen (5g) would contain about 2g of protein. 'An average protein requirement would be around 60g a day so although bee pollen will only contribute slightly to that amount, it is the quality of the protein in bee pollen that is so beneficial. 'What that means is that it contains many of the different types of amino acids that make up protein; this is great because the body needs different amino acids as building blocks in the body. 'Bee pollen can be taken off the spoon, added to smoothies or sprinkled on food and can be a great way to increase the nutrients in your diet.'"

Snowden applied for temporary asylum in Russia on Tuesday from Sheremetyevo International Airport. He ""will leave (the airport) in the next few days because some legal papers are still required to be formalized,"" Russian attorney Anatoly Kucherena said in Moscow. Read more: Snowden's transit zone mysteries ""Therefore, I think this issue will be resolved within a week and after this, the question of granting him temporary asylum will be decided upon."" A former National Security Agency contractor, Snowden admittedly leaked documents to the media that exposed sweeping U.S. electronic surveillance programs. He faces espionage charges. Kucharena, who helped Snowden file his application for asylum, said his client might be able to leave the airport while the request is considered. Interactive: Snowden's options Within a few days, Snowden should receive a certificate showing that the asylum request is under consideration, and that certificate will allow him to legally leave the airport's transit area, the attorney said. It's not clear whether Russia will decide to grant temporary asylum. Snowden has said he wants to stay while awaiting passage to Latin America. President Vladimir Putin said Monday that Snowden appeared to be ""shifting his position somewhat"" when it comes to meeting Russia's conditions for asylum, according to state news agency Ria Novosti. He had earlier said that Snowden would have to ""stop his work aimed at harming our American partners"" if he wanted to stay. The Guardian journalist who broke the Snowden story and a spokesman for WikiLeaks have both indicated that Snowden could reveal more secrets. On Wednesday, Putin told reporters in Moscow that ties between the United States and Russia ""are far more important"" than any intelligence scandal. The Russian leader said that he believes that Snowden ""never intended to stay here, in Russia, forever."" Snowden arrived in Moscow from Hong Kong on June 23. He has been unable to leave because the United States revoked his passport. The presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia have said their countries would give Snowden asylum, and Nicaragua's president said he would offer it ""if circumstances permit."" UK intelligence agency did not break law, post-Snowden inquiry finds Snowden appears likely to try to avoid the chance of U.S. capture even if Russia grants him papers to leave. Washington has no extradition agreement with Russia and FBI agents who work at the American Embassy have no authority to make arrests. The U.S. government has requested Russia expel Snowden. Absent that, it will watch carefully the route he takes if he tries to reach one of the Latin American countries willing to take him in. The United States could grab Snowden if any plane carrying him were to refuel in a country that respects U.S. arrest warrants. But he likely will be careful to avoid that scenario. Nevertheless, the United States has sent provisional arrest warrants to a number of countries where Snowden could either transit or seek asylum, a U.S. official said last week.

The Blues confirmed yesterday how they hoped to turn the Grade II* listed building in Wandsworth into 'one of the most iconic football stadiums in the world'. A 60,000-seater ground, which would take between three and four years to construct, would include the power station's four chimneys and other aspects of the existing structure as part of the design. How the stadium might look with the four chimneys if the club gets the go ahead Chelsea maintain they have yet to decide whether to relocate but they have also insisted it is not economically viable to redevelop Stamford Bridge. That has been disputed by Hammersmith and Fulham Council, whose deputy leader, Nick Botterill, said yesterday: 'We want the Blues to stay at Stamford Bridge and - if it can be done sensibly without negatively affecting local people - increase the ground's capacity so they can retain their position as one of Europe's top clubs. 'CFC is a thriving business which contributes significant benefits to the area and we will continue to work closely with the club to explore all possible avenues for keeping them here at their original home.' Chelsea's hopes of moving rest on convincing fan-led group Chelsea Pitch Owners to sell them the freehold of their current home, something they failed to do at an extraordinary general meeting in October. SayNoCPO, the group of CPO shareholders who spearheaded the opposition to their bid six months ago said: 'The viability of redeveloping Stamford Bridge is still a very relevant issue, with Hammersmith and Fulham Council openly contradicting the club's negative projections.' It is understood Wandsworth Council have no objection in principle to a football club bidding for Battersea Power Station. For sale: Chelsea hope to buy the Battersea Power Station site Home: Chelsea currently play at Stamford Bridge but the club claims it's financially unviable to redevelop Chelsea are not the only bidders for the 39-acre site, which was valued at £500million in October and was put up for sale two months later amid an administration saga. The Blues said in a statement: 'Battersea Power Station is one of London's most famous buildings and has the potential to become one of the most iconic football stadiums in the world. 'Our joint bid was submitted in accordance with the sales process established by the joint administrators for the site. The process could run for a number of months. 'We also appreciate that we have many significant hurdles to address if we are to build a new stadium on the site, including winning the support of our fans, the CPO shareholders and local Wandsworth residents, as well as securing the approval of Wandsworth Council, the Greater London Authority and heritage authorities.' Any new stadium is likely to contain four separate stands in accordance with the wishes of Chelsea's fans, with a 15,000-seater single-tier south stand. The club have also offered to contribute to the cost of a planned extension to the Northern Line into the area."

David-Israel Zenon Murillo was charged with first-degree murder and dealing in stolen property on Monday, five days after Matteo Giovanditto was found dead in his home, a spokeswoman for the Osceola County Sheriff's Department said. Following tips from Murillo, detectives found ""the murder weapon,"" which sheriff's spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain described as a hatchet or small ax. The murder was the first ever recorded in the 14-year history of Celebration, a Disney-developed town five miles south of the Magic Kingdom. While being led into court Monday, Murillo accused Giovanditto of attempting to sexually assault him, saying ""he tried to put something in my drink while I was over there."" ""He was a sick, sick man,"" Murillo said. ""He had what was coming to him."" The sheriff's spokeswoman, Twis Lizasuain, said that Murillo was a transient, living most recently in a wooded area near Kissimmee, Florida. Giovanditto was a counselor who worked with Murillo, and even had a small head-shot of the suspect among those on his computer. The two had known one another for the past year, Lizasuain said. Giovanditto was found dead in his apartment on November 29, and a tip led police the next day to his vehicle in Kissimmee, about 10 miles west. Osceola County Sheriff's deputies brought Murillo in for questioning on Sunday, after discovering that he'd tried to sell some of Giovanditto's coins. Murillo told police that the two were together on November 24, when he ""became enraged and struck Giovanditto with an ax that he found in a closet,"" a sheriff's department statement said. He admitted he continued to hit the victim, even slamming his head into the kitchen floor. The medical examiner's office later concluded that Giovanditto died from blunt force trauma and strangulation, according to the release. The next day, after getting a search warrant, police found Giovanditto's iPad, cash and collector's coins at Murillo's campsite in Kissimmee. Investigators on Monday searched a canal in the area, looking for more evidence based on information from Murillo, as well as a lake near his campsite, Lizasuain said. She said police canvassing the campsite have already found ""significant evidence that corroborated what the suspect told the detectives."" Murillo is fully cooperating with the detectives,"" said Lizasuain. ""We have a great deal of information (because of) what he has provided to them."" Days after Giovanditto's death, police stormed the house of another Celebration resident, Craig Foushee, after a standoff. Foushee killed himself, police said. The two incidents, while unrelated, rattled residents of the picture-perfect town. ""It does have a unique flavor or flair that isn't found in a lot of places,"" resident Chris Stellwag said last week of Celebration. ""(But) it's not like living at Disney World. It's a real town, (with) real issues."""

CNN correspondent Atia Abawi, embedded with the Marines, said troops didn't receive any resistance when they took the station, but gun battles broke out in the area a few hours later. There was an engagement for 15 to 20 minutes, with constant gunfire coming from different directions, and there have been ""sporadic battles,"" Abawi said. Unlike previous days, there was fighting in the evening, with Taliban militants trying to attack Marine locations with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. One of the grenades hit close to one of the U.S. positions and a fire broke out. About 15,000 Afghan and NATO forces are taking part in Operation Moshtarak, which focuses on the town of Marjah and surrounding areas in Helmand province. Set in a region known as the country's heroin capital, Marjah is where the Taliban established a shadow government. The military says the goal of Operation Moshtarak is to provide security, governance and development, and authorities hope fighters choose to reject the insurgency and join the government's reintegration process. Clearing out poppy fields is a key part of the push, the biggest since the Afghanistan War started in 2001. The Taliban finances its activities in part through the illegal opium trade. One of the biggest challenges facing the NATO mission in Afghanistan is attacking the Taliban while limiting civilian casualties. On Sunday, 12 civilians died in a rocket attack by coalition troops. Three other Afghan civilians were killed by NATO in separate incidents on Sunday and Monday. On Tuesday, Abawi spoke to one civilian whose property had been destroyed in the initial push by Marines. Despite that, he said he was happy to see Americans arrive and noted that Marines promised to pay for the damages to his home. He said Afghans have suffered under the Taliban, who he said had beheaded some people and forced their way into people's homes for food."

This photo shows Obama whispering something in his ear in 2009 Four passengers and an airline employee were hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries. Stanley, a Dallas lawyer and prominent Obama donor, made headlines over the summer when he hosted a barbecue fundraiser at his home attended by the president benefiting House Democrats. Stanley, a former Chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council, wrote on his Facebook page that the plane was diverted to Narita International Airport in Tokyo 'due to significant passenger and crew injuries and alleged damage to the plane' caused by 'insane turbulence.' 'One flight attendant took out an exit sign. High marks to crew. Low marks to AA weather folks,' Stanley wrote on his page.

Stanley, who is married and has three grown children, was appointed by President Obama in 2011 to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Council. In early July, Stanley threw a late-afternoon, $10,000-a-plate fundraiser dinner at his home, with proceeds going to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Besides the president, the barbecue was also attended by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. On Tuesday, Marc Stanley and his fellow passengers were settling into their 12-hour transpacific journey from Seoul to Dallas when the plane hit turbulent skies east of Japan, sending glass 'flying' inside the aircraft cabin, according to a woman on board. 'We were eating and all the food just flew up in the air and pretty much bounced off and fell. There were carts all over the place,' one passenger told TV Tokyo when the aircraft landed shortly after midnight at Tokyo's Narita airport.

RSPCA inspectors found the white dogs, named Sapphire and Sammy, had lived in a home smelling of urine and ammonia. They also found a cat called Tigger which, while not as starved as the dogs, was also thin and infested with fleas. Neglected: One of the starved German Shepherd dogs that lived in a home smelling of urine and ammonia in Carlisle, Cumbria Poor condition: RSPCA found the German Shepherd dogs to be underweight and infested with fleas The pets' owners, Colin Chester and Kirsty Kendall, have been banned from keeping animals after they were convicted in court of failing to meet their needs. An investigation began after Chester, 35, and Kendall, 22, of Carlisle, Cumbria, contacted German Shepherd rescue charity Second Chance to ask it to take a dog. When the couple handed over Sapphire, a bitch believed to be less than a year old, charity workers were so concerned by the animal's condition that they took it to a vet and alerted the RSPCA. Inspector Chris Towler, from the RSPCA's Cumbria and North Lancashire branch, went to the couple's home with police and was alarmed by what he found. 'We found a further dog in the premises,' he said. 'It was an adult female, white German Shepherd by the name of Sammy. 'This dog was also emaciated and running with fleas and the property smelled of urine and ammonia.'Tigger the cat was also in a poor condition. All three pets have since been rehomed. Suffering: The pets' owners, Colin Chester and Kirsty Kendall, have been banned from keeping animals after they were convicted in court of failing to meet their needs Chester appeared at Carlisle Magistrates’ Court on July 13, where he pleaded guilty to one charge of failing to meet the needs of the three animals, and one charge of causing suffering to the two dogs due to their emaciated condition. He was banned from keeping animals for five years and was ordered to complete 210 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £500 towards the RSPCA’s prosecution costs. Kendall denied the same allegations, but was later convicted at the same court. She was banned from keeping animals, given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £300 towards the RSPCA's costs. Mr Towler said: 'Throughout the case, lack of finance was clearly an issue. 'While I appreciate that in these times everybody’s tight with money, there are plenty of assisting charities out there who could have helped to prevent this matter and the ultimate suffering of the animals concerned.' Mr Towler praised Second Chance for their initial action, and for their subsequent help in fostering and then rehoming all three pets. 'It has been a good outcome for all three animals and I hope Mr Chester and Miss Kendall think very hard about what they have done,' he added.

But this year, a British company is to monitor the effects of advertising in a more detailed way than ever before - using EEG brain monitors to 'watch' the pleasure centres of viewers as they sit through Britain's most expensive advertising slots in the X Factor final. Viewers will watch the ad breaks wearing an EEG headset - rather like a swimming cap, but monitoring brain waves, particularly in the brain's pleasure centres. The company, SimpleUsability, will also use eye-tracking monitors to work out which advert is most effective. Such 'neuromarketing' monitoring techniques are an extremely new idea - and headsets portable enough to use them are very new indeed. Advertising slots in the slot before the X Factor results are announced cost £8,000 per second - so advertisers use high technology to ensure their adverts are 'working' on the audience Such tools are becoming essential for television advertising companies to compete with the 'accountability' of internet advertising, where advertisers can see immediately whether their audience have clicked. American television company Nielsen, which pioneered much of the monitoring technology we take for granted today, is now testing EEG headsets as a way of monitoring audience reaction. Neurosense, a division of Nielsen, says, 'Our innovative neurological research, combined with The Nielsen Company’s deep expertise on what consumers watch and buy, will provide unmatched knowledge.' Typically, television adverts use much lower tech methods such as surveys conducted after the event. Advances in electro-encephalography have allowed scientists to scan the brain in a huge amount more detail. X Factor presenter Gary Barlow: This year, EEG 'skull caps' will be used to assess the pleasure caused by adverts in the advertising slots within the show The fact that data can be stored and analysed against the running time of the video can pinpoint moments in an advert that 'work' in terms of delivering pleasure. Combined with an eye-tracker, it allows advertisers to 'design' - or re-cut - adverts to work better. 'The break before the winner is announced on Sunday, December 11th’s live final is the most expensive in the UK with slots selling for £8k per second,' says the research company SimpleUsability. 'By using innovative testing technologies that track eye movement and monitor subliminal, emotional responses, we will be recording how each advert rates in terms of excitement, interest and, emotional engagement amongst X Factor viewers.' The company will announce which advert has been most 'effective' just after the competition."

The Saudi-U.S. woman was arrested on September 9 at Rosedale Shopping Center, after FBI agents traced marked notes she was handed at the Menomonie branch to her home. According to court documents in the Menomonie heist, Al-Huthaili gave the teller a note that read, 'I have a gun.' She allegedly demanded money and the teller gave her $2,350, which included 'bait bills' that are marked so police can easily trace them, the Star Tribune reported. FBI agents used the bills to locate her Roseville residence and the next day followed her to Rosedale, where they witnessed her purchase a laptop computer with cash. After she left the store, the agents examined the cash, determining it was that stolen in the Menomonie holdup. Al-Huthaili was arrested that night and agents say she admitted to a September 5 holdup of the First State Bank and Trust in Hudson as well as the one in Menomonie on Monday.

And while the disease typically dies on surfaces within hours, research has discovered it can survive for more than seven weeks under certain conditions. During tests, the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) found that the Zaire strain will live on samples stored on glass at low temperatures for as long as 50 days. The left-hand charts plot survival rates of Zaire strain of Ebola (Zebov) and Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv) on glass (a) and plastic (b) at 4° (39°F) over 14 days. The right-hand charts reveal the survival rate under the same conditions over 50 days. Both viruses survived for 26 days, and Ebola was extracted after 50 days The tests were initially carried out by researchers from DSTL before the current outbreak, in 2010, but the strain investigated is one of five that is still infecting people globally. The findings are also quoted in advice from the Public Agency of Health in Canada. Ebola was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the Filoviridae family. This family includes the Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov), which was first identified in 1976 and is the most virulent; Sudan ebolavirus, (Sebov); Tai Forest ebolavirus; Ebola-Reston (Rebov), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bebov) - the most recent species, discovered in 2008. For their 2010 paper, ‘The survival of filoviruses in liquids, on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol’, the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL)  tested two particular filoviruses on a variety of surfaces. These were the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv), and Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov). Each was placed into guinea pig tissue samples and tested for their ability to survive in different liquids and on different surfaces at different temperatures, over a 50-day period. When stored at 4° (39°F), by day 26, viruses from three of the samples were successfully extracted; Zebov on the glass sample, and Marv on both glass and plastic. By day 50, the only sample from which the virus could be recovered was the Zebov from tissue on glass. For their 2010 paper, ‘The survival of filoviruses in liquids, on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol’, Sophie Smither and her colleagues tested two particular filoviruses on a variety of surfaces. These were the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv), and Zebov. Each was placed into guinea pig tissue samples and tested for their ability to survive in different liquids, and on different surfaces at different temperatures, over a 50-day period. When stored at 4° (39°F), by day 26, viruses from three of the samples were successfully extracted; Zebov on the glass sample, and Marv on both glass and plastic. By day 50, the only sample from which the virus could be recovered was the Zebov from tissue on glass. ‘This study has demonstrated that ﬁloviruses are able to survive and remain infectious, for extended periods when suspended within liquid and dried onto surfaces,’ explained the researchers. ‘Data from this study extend the knowledge on the survival of filoviruses under different conditions and provide a basis with which to inform risk assessments and manage exposure.’ The researchers do stress that these tests were carried out in a controlled lab environment, and not in the real world, but published their findings to highlight the survival rates. Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its Ebola guidelines following the rise in infections. Ebola (pictured) was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the Filoviridae family. This family includes the Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov), which was first identified in 1976 and is the most virulent; Sudan ebolavirus, (Sebov); Tai Forest ebolavirus; Ebola-Reston (Rebov), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bebov) The centre explained that Ebola is not spread through the air, water, or food and a person infected with Ebola can’t spread the disease until symptoms appear. The time from exposure to when signs or symptoms of the disease appear, known as the incubation period, is two to 21 days, but the average time is eight to 10 days. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises: • DO wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. • Do NOT touch the blood or body fluids (like urine, feces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen) of people who are sick. • Do NOT handle items that may have come in contact with a sick person’s blood or body fluids, like clothes, bedding, needles,or medical equipment. • Do NOT touch the body of someone who has died of Ebola. Ebola is spread through direct contact, through broken skin or through eyes, nose, or mouth, via blood and body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola, or objects, such as needles, that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola. Signs of Ebola include fever and symptoms like severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or unexplained bleeding or bruising. Dr Tom Fletcher of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who has treated victims in Guinea and Sierra Leone, says: ‘The initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu-like illness. 'They include fever, headache and lethargy. This progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting.’ Officials have emphasised there is no risk of transmission from people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not yet showing symptoms. But, specialists at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta found that the virus is present on a patient’s skin after symptoms develop, underlining how contagious the disease is once symptoms set in. According to the CDC, the virus can survive for a few hours on dry surfaces like doorknobs and countertops and can survive for several days in puddles or other collections of body fluid. However, bleach solutions, including household bleach, can kill it. Ebola is only spread through direct contact, through broken skin or through eyes, nose, or mouth, via blood and body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola, or objects, such as needles, that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola. It can be killed using bleach There is no FDA-approved vaccine available for Ebola, but experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under development. The CDC advises people wash their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser, to protect themselves. It warns to not touch the blood or body fluids, including urine, faeces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen of people who are sick. Ebola was once thought to originated in gorillas, because human outbreaks began after people ate gorilla meat. But scientists now believe that bats are the natural reservoir for the virus, and that apes and humans catch it from eating food that bats have drooled or defecated on, or by coming in contact with surfaces covered in infected bat droppings and then touching their eyes or mouths. The current outbreak seems to have started in a village near Guéckédou, Guinea, where bat hunting is common, according to Doctors Without Borders.

But these newborn four puppies didn't even make it to Boxing Day before being abandoned. Luckily, however, they were found before it was too late, discovered huddling up together in a battered old shoe box around the back of a branch of Lidl the supermarket in Canterbury, Kent. Found by a member of the public, the two girls and two boys have now been taken in by the Dog's Trust and been named after pantomime characters to mark the season in which they were born: Prince Charming, Cinderella, Snow White and Buttons. The four puppies, found in an old slipper box behind a Lidl in Canterbury, Kent, were named Prince Charming, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Buttons, after pantomime characters 'They were found early morning around the back of Lidl's. We know absolutely nothing about the owner. It could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has failed to sell them' The crossbreed puppies were initially taken to the vet to check over before being taken in by the charity, and are now recovering well from the ordeal. Dogs Trust Canterbury Rehoming Centre manager, Adam Levy, said: 'It really is a  bit of a miracle that the puppies survived after being so callously dumped in  the cold at such a young age. 'We think the puppies were one or two days old  when they were dumped. They have been in our care for a week now and their eyes  still aren't open. 'They were found early morning around the back of Lidl's. We know absolutely  nothing about the owner. It could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has  failed to sell them. 'Our centre looks after thousands of abandoned and unwanted dogs every year,  but it still shocks us to think that someone could just abandon these helpless  puppies without a care if they lived or died. 'They will have to be hand reared for the next three weeks. This takes a lot of  care and at the moment it is being shared out between four of the staff.' The puppies have been hand-reared by Dogs Trust staff since Christmas 'The biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums, like how to deal with other dogs. We can't replace that but we will put them with a mother figure in the future' Staff will bottle-feed the puppies every hour throughout the night to give them  the best possible chance of survival but things are looking good for the  crossbreed pups. Mr Levy said: 'Their behaviour was slightly difficult at first but they have  settled down now and are becoming used to human contact. It is always touch and  go with pups at this age but they're all feeding well. 'The biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums, like how to  deal with other dogs. We can't replace that but we will put them with a mother  figure in the future. 'It's hard to tell what breed they are. They have brown patches which look like  they could be part Jack Russell but they also look quite Staffy. What we do  know is that they are crossbreeds and it will probably become clearer as they  grow.' The puppies are not out of danger yet but things are looking positive for their  recovery. Dogs Trust Canterbury will continue to care for the canine casualties  until they are ready to find loving new homes in the coming months. Dogs Trust CEO, Clarissa Baldwin, said: 'This year sees the 35th anniversary of  Dogs Trust's iconic slogan ""A dog is for life, not just for Christmas"", and  sadly it's as true today as when it was first coined. 'Every year we see a  number of dogs handed into our rehoming centres in the days and weeks around  Christmas when the appeal of a cute puppy has worn off. 'It seems that people are still giving puppies as Christmas presents without  considering the long term ramifications. Dogs can provide a world of happiness  and enjoyment, and we urge anyone considering a new addition to the family to  think it through properly and care for the dogs for its' entire life.' 'Every year we see a number of dogs handed into our rehoming centres in the days and weeks around Christmas when the appeal of a cute puppy has worn off' The puppies were found around the back of the supermarket in a battered old shoe box by a member of the public She added: 'These little puppies are now in excellent hands at Dogs Trust Canterbury who  will do all they can to ensure a suitable and loving home is found for them'  Dogs Trust cares for over 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year for a  variety of reasons, including those that have become unwanted gifts.

Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, are fifth and sixth respectively in the drivers' standings, with the former trailing current leader and reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel by 42 points. The legendary marque's team principal Stefano Domenicali said the problems stem back to the design of the Italia 150 car. ""Our approach was not aggressive enough at the design stage,"" the 45-year-old told Ferrari's official web site. ""There was a problem with the correlation between data gathered from the wind tunnel and what we saw on track so this did the damage in these first few months."" Domenicali, who has been with Ferrari since 1991, said the team's form must improve ahead of three races in four weeks, starting with the Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday. ""If there is one thing you don't want to do, it's panic as it definitely does not help you do better. ""Now we are about to tackle three races in four weeks: it will be important to show that we are back on form and to make it to the podium, something that has escaped us in all of the first three races of the season."" Ferrari's chief designer Nikolas Tombazis has called for a more aggressive approach in order to move Ferrari up the grid, and he claimed the current car cannot challenge Red Bull and McLaren's dominance. ""We have tried to see if our approach was too conservative and we realized that, for various reasons, we were neither reactive nor aggressive enough in the development stages,"" Tombazis told the sport's official web site. ""At the moment, we don't have a winning car and, on those of our competitors we can see innovative solutions introduced in a more aggressive fashion than we have done. ""Maybe we were a bit too passive in our approach. We did not push hard enough in some areas of development and unfortunately, the results can be seen on track.""

Now, seven long weeks into the steamrolling crisis, the United Nations and private charitable organizations are sounding the alarm again as large chunks of the country remain submerged and about 20 million people are in need of assistance. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Friday that the United Nations is seeking another $1.594 billion for flood victims, bringing the total to more than $2 billion. The world body has already received about 70 percent of $460 million it initially requested. ""In the floods' wake, we are seeing hunger, misery and desperation,"" Ban said. ""Children becoming malnourished. Skin diseases on the rise because of the lack of soap and clean water. Nowhere for families to shelter from the sweltering sun. ""Diarrhea could spread quickly in these conditions. Clean water and sanitation equipment must reach even more people. Millions of children and pregnant women are especially at risk. They need access to critical health care. Pakistan is not facing just one humanitarian crisis -- but many at once. Different responses are required."" He called the Pakistan floods ""the worst natural disaster the United Nations has responded to in its 65-year history."" The global spotlight may have shifted away, but floodwaters are still raging through the heart of Pakistan, creating new crises every day, said Valerie Amos, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs. ""An immense tragedy continues to unfold,"" Amos said. ""The human implications of what will happen if not enough is done are terrible. Many millions have already lost everything and have nothing to go back to. ... What I will be doing is asking our supporters to dig deeper and to do more."" But even the new appeal may not be enough as the U.N. food agency said Friday that it needs $600 million for emergency food supplies until next July. So far, it has only received $103 million. The World Food Programme is aiming to feed 6 million people every month while transitioning to recovery activities such as food-for-work programs that will help rehabilitate damaged agricultural lands and infrastructure and restore livelihoods, the agency said. It estimates that at least 17 million acres of farmland from north to south are under water and hundreds of bridges and roadways have been destroyed. On top of that, markets have been disrupted and food prices have skyrocketed, leaving many Pakistanis unable to feed themselves or their families, the WFP said. ""No one could have predicted the scale and enormity of this catastrophe where women and children are facing a dangerous downwards spiral of hunger and malnutrition,"" WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said in a written statement. ""We need to scale-up now and we need to scale-up quickly."" The scale of the devastation was visible from a helicopter this week. From the sky, the landscape below was brown with wide rivers of murky water while specks of bright blue tarpaulins and tents dotted dry land. ""The road to recovery will be long and arduous and Pakistan will need all the help it can get to build back from this disaster,"" Sheeran said. Hunger is just one of Pakistan's myriad problems. Public health experts remain concerned about disease outbreaks. As of a week ago, the United Nations reported more than 700,000 cases of acute diarrhea, at least 800,000 acute respiratory infections, nearly a million cases of skin disease and almost 183,000 suspected malaria cases. ""All of the elements conducive for this to happen are present -- poor sanitation and water supplies, and people are living in cramped conditions in open camp settings,"" said Sylvain Groulx, a project coordinator with Medecins Sans Frontieres, sometimes referred to as Doctors Without Borders, in northern Sindh province. ""Health authorities here have confirmed that there is usually an increase in the number of people who seek medical assistance following Eid, and we are expecting that the health system will be overburdened in the coming days,"" Groulx said in a news release.

About a thousand people, including excited children, turned out in the bitter cold to watch pantomime stars Gareth Gates and Toyah Wilcox flick the switch to turn on Herne Bay's Christmas lights. But they were left stunned when the 'shocking' lights, which barely covered the tree, flickered into life. Many stormed off in disgust as boos and jeers rang out. 'Atrocious': Crowds booed as lights on this Christmas tree in Herne Bay, Kent flickered into life. The town had persuaded panto stars Gareth Gates and Toyah Wilcox to turn on the decorations, but crowds were left bitterly disappointed It later emerged that Canterbury City Council spent a whopping £83,000 on Christmas tree decorations for Canterbury, Whitstable and Herne Bay this year, though the Herne Bay business association were responsible for funding the tree. One resident condemned the decorations as looking like a couple of domestic lightbulbs, while a local businessman laughingly claimed he had more decorations in his shop window. Other shop owners claimed the pathetic decorations would affect their vital Christmas trade. They had been encouraged to open late for last Friday's switch-on but most potential shoppers had drifted away by 5.45pm. Greengrocer Stan Truelove, 57, said: 'It took me an hour to put some lights and a few decorations up in my shop and it definitely looks better than these lights. 'We were asked to keep our shops open until 7pm but everyone left at 5.45pm. 'Christmas tree lights are supposed to put you in the mood for shopping but no one will want to spend money here.

Salon owner Lou Richards added: 'I'm absolutely fuming. Why would you come to Herne Bay to see light bulbs? The tree is an absolute joke.' Canterbury City Council have launched a consultation over the Christmas lights. A spokesman said: 'The display in Herne Bay this year is the same as last year's, with the exception of some netting. 'Consultation on Christmas lights will start with businesses soon and we'll be keen to talk to those traders who are showing an interest in the display in their towns.' The council had provided £83,000 to pay for the decorations in Canterbury, Whitstable and Herne Bay. They added that the Herne Bay business association was responsible for raising any extra funds for the tree. But Coastal Towns manger Chris West said: 'There was more than a thousand people and it was bigger crowd than in Whitstable.'"

Alisha Bromfield was nearly seven months pregnant in August 2012 when she was murdered by Brian Cooper at a wedding. The victim’s mother, Sherry Anicich, filed a lawsuit Monday accusing Home Depot and Grand Flower Growers of failing to notice 'a pattern of misconduct and violent tendencies' in Cooper. Scroll down for video Fatal attraction: Brian Cooper, 37 (left), was sentenced last month to two consecutive life term in the 2012 murder of Alisha Bromfield (left), 21, who was seven months pregnant at the time of her death Innocent life: Bromfield's unborn daughter, named posthumously Ava Lucille, was viable at the time of the murder but she could not be saved The 37-year-old, who was Alisha Bromfield's boss, failed to take part in anger management counseling required by Grand Flower Growers, according to court filings cited by Courthouse News Service. The lawsuit claims that the man was known to be 'emotionally unstable and violent,’ at times hurling items at employees. Last month, Cooper was sentenced to two consecutive life terms without parole after being convicted in May of two counts of first-degree intentional homicide. Cooper killed Bromfield, of Plainfield, Illinois, when the two were at a Nasewaupee resort for his sister Kellie Stryker’s wedding. After strangling the expectant mother for refusing to be in a relationship with him, the man raped her lifeless body. Defendants: Sherry Anicich's wrongful death lawsuit names Home Depot and Grand Flower Growers, which employed both Cooper and Bromfield Bereaved mother: Sherry Anicich, Bromfield's mother, claims in her lawsuit that Home Depot and Grand Flower Growers knew about Cooper's violent tendencies but did nothing to protect her daughter from him Murdered and defiled: The 21-year-old pregnant merchendiser was strangled to death at a wedding, after which Brian Cooper raped her corpse Bromfield’s unborn baby daughter, named posthumously Ava Lucille, was viable at the time but died as a result of her mother’s murder and sexual assault. According to the lawsuit filed in Cook County Court by Bromfield's mother, her daughter was hired in 2006 as a merchandiser for Grand Flower Growers, a Wisconsin company that supplied blooms to Home Depot stores throughout Illinois. Cooper also worked for Grand, but according to Sherry Anicich, Home Depot was in charge of ensuring the safety of its grower's staff. ‘Home Depot knew or reasonably should have been aware of this pattern of misconduct and violent tendencies on its premises, since Cooper would publicly decry Alisha as a 'whore' and 'slut' and had been known to throw items at employees,’ the lawsuit states. Court filings indicate that Ms Bromfield repeatedly complained to Grand management about Cooper's unwelcome sexual advances, but her words allegedly fell on deaf ears. In her suit, Mrs Anicich alleges that her daughter's complaints were not only ignored, but her managers even arranged for Cooper to be alone with Alisha. The slain woman's family are seeking unspecified punitive damages for the ‘loss of love, support, guidance, affection and companionship’ of Bromfield and her child, Chicago Tribune reported. During his trial last June, Brian Cooper's defense was that the alcohol he had during and after his sister's wedding reception inhibited his ability to form intent. He has never denied killing Bromfield. Attack: Cooper is accused of strangling Alisha Bromfield and sexually assaulting her body at a Wisconsin hotel A void that can't be filled: The victim's family are suing for damages, claiming a loss of love and companionship The civil complaint states that in 2012, Cooper insisted that Bromfield accompany him to his sister's wedding and meet his family. Following the nuptials, the lawsuit claims, Cooper brought Bromfield to a hotel room he had booked where he continued 'his pattern of verbal and physical.' The 21-year-old mother-to-be refused Cooper's advances, sending him into a homicidal rage, the lawsuit states. The inebriated man proceeded to strangle Alisha as she begged for mercy for herself and her unborn baby girl. Once the woman was dead, the lawsuit goes on to say that Cooper undressed and raped her."

Darius Majchrzak, 39, and his partner Samea Kubiak, 35, are accused of strangling Paulina Starczewska before hiding her body more than a decade ago. The couple, who now live in the West Midlands, were only linked to the unsolved killing after Kubiak confessed to police when they attended a domestic incident outside their home. She was flown to Holland and led officers to the body, which had been buried on a campsite in Landsmeer, outside Amsterdam. Kubiak claimed Majchrzak had strangled the victim to death after trying to sexually assault both women following a booze and drug-fuelled party. The couple had continued living at the campsite for another five months, despite the body being buried just yards away, she said. A judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court ordered Majchrzak should be extradited to the Netherlands to face a murder charge and an associated offence relating to unlawful burial. Kubiak, who also faces similar allegations, will learn whether she will be extradited today. The couple left the campsite for France shortly after the killing in early 2000, before settling in Dudley six years ago. Both were arrested in May after police were called to a domestic incident outside their home in Occupation Street, Dudley. Kubiak was initially treated as a witness but became a suspect after she returned to the UK, and was arrested by West Midlands Police on the request of Dutch authorities. Ordering Majchrzak’s extradition, District Judge Michael Snow said: ‘It is apparent that the Dutch authorities knew nothing about the murder of Ms Starczewska until Ms Kubiak reported it to the police in May 2012. ‘After contact between the Dutch and UK authorities, Ms Kubiak travelled to Holland where she identified the location of the body of Ms Starczewska.’ The extradition request was not an abuse of process and complied with the European Convention on Human Rights, he added. Majchrzak has seven days to appeal the decision and has been remanded in custody pending his removal to Holland."

He will remain in jail pending a verdict on that case, according to Petra news agency. It did not say why he was found not guilty in the American school case. The cleric was deported from the United Kingdom last year, ending a years-long legal battle to force him to leave the country. A Jordanian national, he was wanted in his home country, where he had been convicted in absentia on two charges of conspiracy to cause explosions. Britain had been trying to deport him since 2001, but his legal appeals kept him there until last year. In January 2012, the European Court of Human Rights blocked Britain from sending him to Jordan over fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him at trial. British authorities said he raised funds for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and publicly supported militants' violent activities. Videos of his preaching were found in a German apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks on the United States, including ringleader Mohammed Atta. Abu Qatada has denied the allegations against him. He arrived in the UK in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. He came to Britain on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents, and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children.

The Magpies travel to in-form Manchester United on Boxing Day on the back of three successive defeats, the last of them a 1-0 reverse at the hands of neighbours Sunderland, an unprecedented fourth consecutive derby loss. Just a few weeks ago, it would have been a fixture Pardew's men might have approached with some relish having already dispensed with Tottenham, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea. Newcastle United players joked around in training giving each other piggy backs on Wednesday morning Jack Colback (top) is given a lift by Steven Taylor during training exercises on Wednesday morning Newcastle players joke around ahead of their visit to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Boxing Day Newcastle showed no signs of a hangover following their 1-0 defeat against Sunderland Asked if his team had saved its best performances for the Barclays Premier League's big boys, the 53-year-old replied: 'Yes and no. 'Some of the top clubs, we have not played so well - Arsenal, we didn't play well, but Spurs we beat, Liverpool we beat as well. 'We can raise our game, but we don't score a lot of goals, and that's something that is a concern, really, going into the second half of the season, how many goals we have scored. 'That's an area we are going to have to improve on against any team. 'But when you play the top teams, you can keep it tight and one goal, two goals can sometimes be enough. But not always, and we need to score more goals.' Newcastle have fared reasonably well on their most recent league visits to Old Trafford, drawing 1-1 there in November 2011, losing by the odd goal in seven on Boxing Day the following year and finally ending a 41-year wait for a victory in December last year. Jak Alnwick trains with Newcastle on Wednesday morning ahead of their trip to Old Trafford on Boxing Day Alan Pardew (Centre) holds training and dishes out instructions during the session on Wednesday Pardew said: 'We have had decent performances at Old Trafford, I think, in the last three. We drew, we lost in the last minute - which was a cracking game - 4-3, and then we won last year, so we have done reasonably well there. 'One of the reasons we have one well there is we have retained possession well, and that's something we are going to have to do because you can't turn possession over to Manchester United with the quality they have got up front. 'They are going well at the minute. They are on a great run, and it's a game that every time you play them, you have to look forward to it.

His opposite number on Friday, Spaniard David de Gea, has emerged as the bedrock of United's improving form, and Pardew knows how difficult it will be to find a way past him. He said: 'There's a contrast in goal at the moment: Jak is on his second or third Premier League start, and De Gea pushing (Manuel) Neuer for the title of being the best goalkeeper in the world. 'He's a fantastic shot-stopper. He still has parts of his game that he still wishes to develop, but in one on one situations, he excels and covers a lot of the areas where goalscorers want to score in, with his feet, his hands and how he wants to approach things. 'He makes it very difficult to score, so you have to go with power and go for the corners.'"

Whatever was thrown at him he soaked it up, like a seasoned football team executing its plan away from home and carving out the result, in this case a 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 quarter-final win over the local hero. Having slain the Australian teenager to make his fifth semi-final at Melbourne Park, Murray was gracious in his on-court interview, impressing the crowd with warm words about Kyrgios’s future. Andy Murray celebrates after taking the second set tie-break en route to victory against Nick Kyrgios Kyrgios covers himself as Murray strikes down on him at the net during a dominant display in Melbourne Murray looks to the sky and points his fingers upwards after reaching the Australian Open semi-finals The No 6 seed performs a typical fist pumping celebration after winning a decisive point in the match It was only later, when facing questions about his next opponent Tomas Berdych and his new coach Dani Vallverdu — Murray’s long-time friend and former chief lieutenant — that he became slightly prickly. Vallverdu’s presence on the Czech’s team, just two months after he finished five years with the 27-year-old Scot’s team, provides a fascinating subtext to Thursday’s match. Privileged inside information will be traded. But Murray is trying not to see it that way and disingenuously claimed that in other sports people do not talk about opposition coaches and managers. ‘My goal isn’t to beat Dani, my goal is to beat Berdych, so I don’t think about that,’ he said. ‘We’ll see how the match plays out and what the tactics are. But I also know what Dani thinks of Berdych’s game because he’s told me, so it works both ways. I’m happy to talk about Berdych and what his strengths and weaknesses are, but I don’t want to discuss what Dani does well and doesn’t do well, because I’m not playing him.’ Thereafter he reeled off the world No 7’s attributes, such as his height, strength and flat ballstriking ability, and how he must be playing well. That is true, for the newly-engaged Berdych has made it through without dropping a set and dismissed Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-0, 7-6, although the Spaniard — short of matches and possibly injured — was woefully out of touch in the first two sets. Tomas Berdych is Murray's next opponent after he saw off Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-0, 7-6 Berdych celebrates as he makes the next stage where he will face Murray at the Australian Open Berdych's coach Dani Vallverdu is Murray’s long-time friend and former chief lieutenant Vallverdu (right) will be in Berdych's corner for his Australian Open clash with Murray Murray showed admirable fortitude against the youthful zest of Kyrgios but, whatever the circumstances, will feel more vulnerable against Berdych. The 29-year-old holds a 4-2 career record against him, and there have been matches in which he has found his easy power difficult to handle. Now there is the emotional dimension of having his one-time ally plotting against him, the Venezuelan boy who befriended him as an adolescent at their tennis academy in Barcelona and who knows him, warts and all. In his exclusive interview with Sportsmail last week, Vallverdu went out of his way to stay classy, declaring that he would ‘always be in Andy’s corner, except if I am coaching against him’. He also endorsed the hiring of Amelie Mauresmo as head coach last summer, even though he was hurt at not being kept informed about the hiring. The one thing he has taken exception to is Murray’s suggestion that not everyone in the team was pulling in the same direction towards the end of last year. Murray waves as he enters the Rod Laver Arena, where most of the 15,000 crowd were supporting Kyrgios The former Wimbledon champion stretches for a return during his 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 defeat of the Australian British No 1 Murray celebrates a first break of serve as he wins the opening set 6-3 Amelie Mauresmo is Murray's new coach and will be in his corner for the Australian Open match What you know is that the gloves will be off as he sits at opposite ends of the stadium to his former colleagues on Thursday (at about 8.30am in the UK), and Murray will need to show the same resolve as he did against Kyrgios. It could be argued that, for all its breathtaking skill and athleticism, the rivalries in the men’s game can be a little too cordial at times. The untamed demeanour of the 19-year-old Australian has been a welcome blast of refreshment here. He had no option but to come out blasting against Murray and try to feed off the crowd, though they are fundamentally well-disposed towards Murray here. Instead he found his game brilliantly neutered by the master tactician on an evening when at least the chill temperatures will have made the Scot feel at home. Murray slowed down his opponent’s quick tempo between points, and prevented him from teeing off with a subtle mix of pace, angles and slices, including some feathered drop-shots. Not only that but the Scot’s serve was outstanding, and his 13 aces outscored by four the man who came into the match having hit the most in the tournament. Kim Sears celebrates wildly as Murray takes control of the match in blustery conditions in Melbourne Murray's girlfriend Sears takes her seat for one of the more comfortable afternoons of watching her boyfriend Judy Murray will also be backing her son when he faces Berdych in Melbourne To add to his deflation, at 2-5 Kyrgios was given an audible obscenity violation, having cursed his way through his previous match without punishment. There was inconsistency in that, and the way he escaped censure when smashing his racket in the tiebreak. Memorably, Murray had played an exquisite running lob to stop his momentum in that, and then he performed another on set point to clinch it 7-5. It was a glorious example of touch and technique, and clarity of thought, under enormous pressure. Kyrgios, whose brief charge in the third set was undone by some extraordinary flicks from Murray off the baseline, will come again. Asked where he would like to be when he returns here next year he responded drily: ‘Melbourne.’ Nadal, who denied he was injured, needs more matches, and he will get them next month when he heads to clay-court events in South America. But his defeat will still have served as a boost to the sometimes brittle Berdych, who had lost to him 17 consecutive times. For all sorts of reasons Murray will have masses of motivation when they meet, and so will he.

Waxed to perfection and flanked by a group of muscular black men dressed like a camp Queen's Guards, the gay fashion reporter flounced down the carpet to greet his public. ""Vassup CNN! Lookin' hot,"" Bruno said to CNN. ""I don't want any attention; I'm not here to promote my movie."" ""Bruno,"" which hits cinemas in most territories next month, is the latest comic creation of British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who last shocked, insulted and delighted audiences in 2006 with Borat, Kazakhstan's ""Most Famous Broadcaster."" Bruno continues the unique approach to comedy Baron Cohen honed with characters like uneducated, loutish jungle music fan Ali G and then homophobic, anti-Semitic Kazakh journalist Borat.  Watch ""Bruno"" on the red carpet » His specialty is characters who say the unsayable: like Bruno's carpet quip that his new film is ""the most important movie starring a gay Austrian since 'Terminator 2,'"" in joking reference to the married (and firmly heterosexual) Austrian Terminator star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, now Governor of California.  In pictures: Bruno offers fashion advice to CNN » Baron Cohen puts his creations in real-life situations and uses them to draw unsuspecting participants into letting well-hidden prejudices slip out, engage in embarrassing behavior or contradict themselves. Characters like Bruno and Borat ""essentially work as a tool,"" Baron Cohen told UK paper The Observer in a rare out-of-character interview: ""By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice."" Baron Cohen's approach courts controversy. ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" opened to a wave of outrage from race-relations campaigners. This time it is gay-rights campaigners who are up in arms. ""Sacha Baron Cohen's well-meaning attempt at satire is problematic in many places and outright offensive in others,"" Rashad Robinson, senior director of media programs for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation told the New York Times. While some critics may suggest that his films may reinforce prejudices, others disagree. ""It is difficult to accuse Cohen of making films that are racist or homophobic,"" Aubrey Day, Editor-in-Chief of Total Film magazine told CNN. ""He takes characters and exaggerates them for broad comic value, but I don't think there's any credence in the idea that he supports any of those ideals."" But Baron Cohen certainly knows how to manipulate the media. The 37-year-old has been whipping up anticipation for ""Bruno"" with a series of attention-grabbing, hilarious stunts. In September last year, he brought chaos to the hallowed fashion shows of Milan when he stormed the catwalk of designer Agata Luiz de la Prada's show dressed in a Velcro suit with clothes from backstage stuck all over it. Most recently, he descended from the ceiling at the MTV Movie Awards wearing nothing but a pair of angel's wings and a skimpy thong before ""falling"" onto irate rapper Eminem's face. Eminem stormed out of the awards but later admitted he knew about the stunt beforehand. ""Borat"" debuted at number one in the U.S. box office and went on to gross $300 million in box office and DVD sales. Industry experts are predicting an even bigger return for ""Bruno."" The secret of the Baron Cohen comedy phenomenon may lie in his combination of laughs with something a bit deeper: namely his ability to highlight prejudices and hypocrisies. ""What he does very well is hold a mirror up to a lot of society's current ideals and expose them for what they are,"" Day told CNN. ""That is one of the joys of his films. ""You can enjoy them on a simple level, in that they are very funny, but hopefully you also come away thinking, or maybe re-thinking some of your attitudes."""

The protest comes a day after the first woman was killed in a demonstration against the government, according to opposition activists. The women called for sanctions against President Ali Abdullah Saleh and asked that he be tried by the International Criminal Court. They also alleged that snipers were on the rooftop of the foreign ministry Sunday. The protests came hours after gunfire and loud explosions reverberated throughout the capital early Monday. Medics in Change Square said at least four people were killed and another 26 injured after government forces raided parts of the capital. Another eight people died and 20 were injured in government raids on civilian property, said Abdulqawi al-Qaisi, a prominent opposition leader and head of the Sadeq Ahmar media office. ""The death toll is expected to rise as a number of the injured are in critical condition,"" he said. According to eyewitnesses, government security forces clashed with tribesmen loyal to Hashid tribal leader Sadeq Al-Ahmar in the Hasabah neighborhood in northern Sanaa. Government forces attacked the tribal leader's family residences, al-Qaisi said. ""The government attacks against innocent civilians and the Ahmar family continued for hours and hundreds of explosions were heard throughout the morning, causing fear throughout the capital,"" he said. Residents and witnesses also reported that the Republican Guard was bombarding the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division, loyal to Maj. Gen.

In a separate demonstration in the city of Taiz, a government sniper killed a woman with a shot to the head, medics and eyewitnesses said. Medics identified the woman as Aziza Othman Kaleb. Snipers also injured four others who were next to the woman in the march, the sources said. Opposition activists said the slain woman was 20 and said she was the first female to be killed while marching against the government. CNN could not independently confirm that claim. Activist Atiaf Alwazir called the shooting of a woman ""a sign that the government security forces will not really stop shooting, even if there are women."" ""Women may have been beaten, arrested at times -- but never directly shot at and this is a scary escalation,"" she said. The crackdown in Sanaa was also bloody, doctors said. ""The injured are entering the hospital by the minute. We need help. We call on people to donate blood for the injured,"" said Mohammed Al-Qubati, who works at a field hospital in Change Square. Five of the wounded are in critical condition, he said from the square that has become the center of protests against Saleh. Protesters carried signs with slogans including: ""Saleh kills and the world watches. Is this the justice the West preaches?"" according to witnesses and activists. Others carried flowers or signs that said: ""We are not armed, Don't attack us with gunfire,"" witnesses said Sunday. CNN has not independently confirmed the details of casualties in Sanaa or Taiz, and the government has not yet responded to requests for comment. Saleh, meeting Sunday with Yemeni leaders, said members of the U.N. Security Council don't understand the true picture in his country, the state news agency Saba reported. He also said those who participate in ""heavily armed marches"" are killing soldiers. ""Are these peaceful acts?"" he asked, according to the news agency. Last week, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Sanaa, marching, chanting and calling for the United Nations to come out with a firm resolution in support for change in the country. For its part, the government said it is trying to come up with a solution to end the political stalemate.

U.S. professors Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson are joint recipients of the Nobel Prize for economics. Ostrom becomes the first woman to win the prize in its 40-year history. The award was a ""great surprise... I'm still a little bit in shock,"" she said by phone at the news conference announcing the prize. Ostrom, a professor of political science at Indiana University, was praised ""for her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons."" Ostrom's work shows that local communities often manage common resources -- such as woods, lakes and fish stocks -- better on their own than when outside authorities impose rules, the committee said. ""Bureaucrats sometimes do not have the correct information, while citizens and users of resources do,"" she said to explain the significance of her work. The committee highlighted her research on a dam in Nepal as an example, saying her research has moved analysis of nonmarket institutions ""from the fringe of economic analysis to the very center."" Ostrom said she had not yet thought about what she would do with her half of the $1.4 million prize. Williamson, a professor in the graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, was cited ""for his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm."" Williamson's work examines why large corporations tend to arise -- and why they do not -- based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. ""He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,"" the panel said. Forbes magazine said, ""He authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that challenged the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. He focused on the contracts and transactions that could explain the structure and boundaries of companies."" Williamson did not speak at the announcement ceremony. ""At some fundamental level, they are really both addressing the fundamental issue of how we create human cooperation through the design of appropriate institutions,"" committee member Tore Ellingsen said. ""They want to understand nonmarket institutions. ... Both laureates look at such institutions very much as conflict-resolution mechanisms,"" he said. While the two professors' work has much in common at an ""abstract level,"" their methods are different, Ellingsen said. Ostrom works from case studies to derive general patterns, while Williamson uses theoretical reasoning. The global financial crisis did not affect the committee's deliberations ""that much,"" committee member Beril Holmlund said, noting that Nobel prizes ""tend not to be for work done last year."" The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established in 1968 by the Central Bank of Sweden in memory of Alfred Nobel.

Hamza Ali, 20, took three unexplained days off his duty at Snaresbrook Crown Court - arguing there was 'no way' he could miss the trip. And when he was summoned to explain himself yesterday, Ali arrived 15 minutes late. Ali, who had to be prompted to apologise to Judge Timothy Lamb QC, said: ‘I was only two minutes late because there was traffic. My dad drove me. ‘I booked my holiday and there was no way of me cancelling it. ‘I went on Friday and I came back on Monday at 6pm. ‘No-one called me to come to court on Tuesday and someone said to come in on the Thursday.’ Judge Lamb sent Ali to the cells for a day before hearing his excuses. This morning, after another night behind bars, he was fined £1,500 for contempt of court. The rogue juror had been granted a day off on Friday 30 August. But on Monday he did not turn up at court. Unable to get hold of Ali, the Judge was forced to continue the trial while court staff spent three days chasing him. Eventually a summons was issued. Judge Lamb said his actions had wasted time and money. He said: ‘You deliberately went on holiday after I warned you of the consequences. ‘The vast majority have no difficulty in understanding the terms of their summons but you think you are an exception. Judge Timothy Lamb QC was forced to continue the trial while court staff spent three days looking for Ali Sentenced: Ali had to be prompted to apologise for missing three days of service despite being told not to ‘You are not. You are simply arrogant. ‘You cost the taxpayer a great deal of money, you have wasted the time of this court and the time of this court’s staff while they chased you.’ Ali eventually added: 'I sincerely apologise for not attending jury service. ‘I did go on holiday and I did not realise how important it was.’"

Van Gaal’s immediate concern, though, is winning at The Etihad Stadium. Despite spending £158million on new players in the last transfer window, United are yet to win an away game, failing to overcome Burnley, Sunderland, MK Dons, Leicester City or West Brom.

We’ve drawn the other games and we could have won, it’s small margins. We only lost out in height which made it difficult at set-plays. Maybe you can advise me to buy tall players.’ So will Vincent Kompany and Edin Dzeko be a threat today? ‘City have scored only one out of a set-play, less than us,’ said Van Gaal dismissively. Wayne Rooney will return from suspension to captain United for the first time in the derby.

While it is not yet clear why Brown’s charge was reduced, TMZ reports it may be because the injuries were minor. The victim apparently claims Brown broke his nose but according to the publication, the police have stated that the man was treated for a fractured nasal bone. The original police report allegedly stated that it was Brown’s bodyguard who threw the punch, but the bodyguard's charge has also been reduced to a misdemeanour.

However there have been conflicting witness accounts and Brown has apparently denied punching the alleged victim, claiming the man tried to board his tour bus and his bodyguard 'handled it'. Brown, who will appear in court again on November 25, has also been accused of making a homophobic slur during the altercation that led to his arrest. The alleged victim, Isaac Adams Parker, 20, of Beltsville, Maryland, told police the Brown commented: 'I’m not down with that gay s**t,' when he attempted to get into a picture that the singer was taking with a female fan. Conflicting accounts: Chris pleaded not guilty. It is unclear whether it was him or his bodyguard who threw a punch at the alleged victim, which the victim claimed broke his nose Minor injuries?: It has been claimed that Brown and his bodyguard's charges may have been reduced because the victim was allegedly treated for a fractured nasal bone rather than a broken nose Parker claims he replied: 'Why you hoing?' and Brown answered: 'I feel like boxing.' Parker alleges he was punched by Brown and then his bodyguard, and that the singer then went and stood behind the bodyguard and told Parker to 'walk away'. TMZ further reports that the Los Angeles County Probation Department are now launching an investigation to determine whether the charges violate the terms of the probation he is currently on. The website claims the Probation Department was informed of the arrest by Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos, and he allegedly could face up to four years in prison if it is decided that his probation should be revoked.

When girls hit puberty they have their bottom two teeth removed in a bizarre ritual before a small hole is cut into their bottom lip. A clay disc is then inserted into the hole, which is steadily increased, stretching the lip, much like flesh-tunnel piercings which have become popular with teenagers in the UK. The larger the lip plate the more cows the girl's father can demand in dowry when his daughter is married - usually 40 for a small plate and 60 for a larger one. Men on the other hand take part in the considerably less-painful ritual of body painting. A basic paint is made from herbs and plants mixed with soil, before the tribesmen cover themselves with it, sculpting it into patterns. In recent years, some young women from the tribes are refusing to have their lips pierced, and removing their teeth can be a violent and sometimes traumatising task.

Dr Brown recommends looking towards the north-east horizon around two hours after sunset.

'The plans for a new high street for the capital show that London continues to attract the best in terms of architecture, design and innovation,' he said."

The practice of photo retouching in fashion publications renders most models completely free of blemishes or imperfections to the point of being unrealistic. But this photo of Crawford baring her sun-kissed torso is drawing praise for showing her in a realistic light. The image comes from a cover shoot for the December 2013 issue of Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America, representatives for the Mexico-based publication said. The photo in question was not published, and spokespeople did not provide an explanation for how it surfaced last week. Sex, lies and media ""During the session that we did at that time for our edition, we proved that Cindy is an ambassador of beauty who has made history. It was a total privilege to have this fashion icon on the cover,"" Ariadne Grant, editor in chief of Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America, said in a news release. ""The most important thing about this news is to note the beauty that Crawford has always been, and how happy we are that she has been part of a production for Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America -- a title that shows the strength and power of real women, always respecting (their) beauty, individuality and femininity."" Opinion: Is Cindy Crawford's photo empowering? The image spread through social media on Friday after British ITV News anchor Charlene White shared it on Twitter, attributing it to Marie Claire magazine. White said she first spotted the image on a friend's private Instagram feed and sought it out on Twitter. She said she found it on a fashion blog whose name she couldn't recall, and she shared the image from there. Regardless of the photo's origins, White said, she took comfort in the image as a celebrity whose looks are constantly scrutinized. ""Women come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes,"" White said. ""I think it's important to see all sorts of body shapes on our screens and in our magazines so that people have a true reflection of what people look like."" Fat is the new ugly on the playground The American version of Marie Claire, a joint venture between Hearst Magazines and French-based Marie Claire Album, called the image real, honest and gorgeous but denied any connection to the photo. ""It appears that this unretouched version is a leak,""  the magazine said in an online post Friday. ""No matter where the photo came from, it's an enlightenment -- we've always known Crawford was beautiful, but seeing her like this only makes us love her more."" Report: Kids as young as 5 concerned about body image The image is still resonating days later. Actress Jamie Lee Curtis was one of many to applaud the image on Twitter by sharing an image of herself in skivvies. ""Bravo Cindy Crawford,"" she said. ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is all Ye need to know on earth, and all Ye need to know."" Others, however, questioned the reflex to applaud realistic depictions of women in fashion. The response has not been entirely positive. But White said it matters not what detractors say. ""I want people to feel like magazines aren't responsible for their happiness when it comes to their bodies but magazines also have a responsibility to show us an array of images,"" she said. Bottom line? ""No one has the right to tell other people how to feel about their body."" Age before beauty? We've got both, actually"

Bradley Manning made from a knotted bedsheet have been released just as the accused conspirator finished day two of the trial that will determine whether or not he willingly helped America’s enemies by engineering the biggest leak of classified material in U.S. history. The noose, which Manning admitted he made as he contemplated suicide shortly after his 2010 arrest, was used to support the military's argument that it was trying to protect the former Army intelligence officer by keeping him in strict isolation and without clothes at Quantico, Virginia's Marine Corps base. Manning said November 29 during a pre-trial hearing that he’d fashioned the noose while being held in Kuwait soon after he was accused in May 2010 of leaking reams of military and diplomatic documents to the website WikiLeaks. He said his time in Kuwait was the lowest he felt during his entire confinement. Exhibit A: Manning contemplated killing himself with this peach-colored noose just after his 2010 arrest. Hacker Adrian Lamo testified Tuesday the soldier was suicidal even before over 'American atrocities in Iraq' Now, a convicted hacker who took the stand June 4 as part of Manning's court martial appears to back up the military's assertion the soldier is emotionally unhealthy. According to the LA Times, Lamo testified that Manning called himself 'morally and emotionally troubled' and felt like a 'broken soul' who was so troubled by what he described as America's atrocities in Iraq that he'd considered suicide. Lamo also revealed during testimony that Manning never said he wanted to aid America’s enemies over the few days the two conversed via instance messages in 2010. Ironically, the hacker—a man named Adrian Lamo—was the very same who alerted federal authorities the day after Manning told him that he had large amounts of sensitive military information at his disposal that he'd been leaking for months. When Manning’s defense attorney David Coombs asked Lamo on the stand Tuesday if the Private First Class had ever said he wanted to help America’s enemies, Lamo answered ‘Not in those words, no.’ Manning is on trial for giving hundreds of thousands of documents to the secret-spilling website WikiLeaks. He pleaded guilty to charges that could bring 20 years behind bars, but the military has pressed ahead with a court-martial on more serious charges, including aiding the enemy. That charge carries a potential life sentence. Suicidal? Manning admitted he considered suicide after his 2010 arrest, and Tuesday, Lamo revealed Manning told him he considered suicide before, due to 'America's atrocities in Iraq' Lamo started chatting online with Manning on May 20, 2010, and alerted law enforcement the next day about the contents of the soldier's messages, including his mention of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He said he continued chatting with Manning on and off for six more days. On cross-examination, Lamo said Manning never told him he wanted to help the enemy and did not express disloyalty to America. Prosecutors have said they will show the 25-year-old Army intelligence analyst effectively put U.S. military secrets into the hands of the enemy, including Osama bin Laden. They said they will present evidence that bin Laden requested and obtained from another al-Qaida member the Afghanistan battlefield reports and State Department cables published by WikiLeaks. Paying his debt? Lamo was convicted in 2004 of hacking the computer networks of the New York Times and Microsoft and served 6 months house arrest and 2 months probation Leaked: Lamo, left, testified that Manning, right, seemed emotionally unsound when the two chatted online. Lamo alerted authorities after Manning told him he'd been leaking government documents for months Suicidal: Manning remained unmoved during Lamo's testimony, in which the convicted hacker revealed the soldier to be emotionally troubled and suicidal The soldier from Crescent, Okla., has said he did not believe the information would harm the U.S. and he released the information to enlighten the public about the bitter reality of America's wars. The case is the most high-profile prosecution for the Obama administration, which has been criticized for its crackdown on those who leak information. It's also by far the most voluminous release of classified material in U.S. history, and certainly the most sensational since the 1971 publication of the Pentagon Papers, a secret Defense Department history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The 7,000 pages of the Pentagon Papers showed that the U.S. government repeatedly misled the public about the Vietnam War. Their leak to The New York Times set off an epic clash between the Nixon administration and the press and led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling on the First Amendment. The material WikiLeaks began publishing in 2010 documented complaints of abuses against Iraqi detainees, a U.S. tally of civilian deaths in Iraq, and America's weak support for the government of Tunisia - a disclosure that Manning supporters said helped trigger the Middle Eastern pro-democracy uprisings known as the Arab Spring. Saintly? Meanwhile, Manning's defense described him as an idealistic and naïve young soldier who wanted to change the world for good The Obama administration has said the release of the material threatened to expose valuable military and diplomatic sources and strained America's relations with other governments. Lamo testified Manning had contacted him because of his notoriety in the hacking community and because of his open support and leadership in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Lamo pleaded guilty in 2004 of computer fraud after he was arrested for hacking the computer networks of the New York Times and Microsoft. He was sentenced to six months house arrest and two years probation. Fame monger? Lamo's testimony came on day two of Manning's trial. On day one of the proceedings, the prosecution painted Manning as a man out for notoriety Manning chose to have his court-martial heard by a judge instead of a jury. It is expected to run all summer. Much of the evidence is classified, which means large portions of the trial are likely to be closed to reporters and the public. Federal authorities are looking into whether Assange can also be prosecuted. He has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on sex-crimes allegations. 'This is not justice; never could this be justice,' Assange said in a statement Monday. 'The verdict was ordained long ago. Its function is not to determine questions such as guilt or innocence, or truth or falsehood. It is a public relations exercise, designed to provide the government with an alibi for posterity.' Serious: The 25-year-old faces 21 charges for leaking sensitive military documents and could face life in jail"
854467,cnn-train-a80c1141f9ce05fba286bb0ee9a0c7e1cd8aa8aa,"I haven't been using full full body cryotherapy for several years, Harrington Harrington commented to CNN.",REFUTES,"[81, 96]",1.0,NegateSentences,"[1, 2]",,cnndm/cnn/stories/a80c1141f9ce05fba286bb0ee9a0c7e1cd8aa8aa.story,"(CNN)Would you dare to freeze yourself fit by stepping into a chilling chamber colder than Antarctica? Golfers are used to frosty fairways, stormy tees and soggy greens but Padraig Harrington is taking the plunge with a real deep freeze. Ireland's three-time major winner is following in the chilling footsteps of actor Daniel Craig and super-fit soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo by exposing himself to cryotherapy in preparation for the 2015 season. ""I've used whole body cryotherapy for several years,"" Harrington commented to CNN. ""Guided by research from Setanta College, it's played a key part in my recovery, especially between competitive periods."" Cryotherapy translates as cold cure -- but for some the intense chill goes beyond words. ""The cold floods your brain and you can't process much more than putting one foot in front of another,"" Mike Moynihan, a columnist for the Irish Examiner, recalls of his experience in the chiller. ""Your body is in revolt and won't allow you to relax. It's so different, to be that cold, that I had a real notion of what people mean when they refer to a hostile environment -- but that only came afterwards, when I was outside."" Chill with a thrill For others, cryotherapy is an ecstatic chill with a thrill. ""I call it 'legal doping,' says Eduardo Bohorquez, who runs New York's only cryotherapy center. ""When you come out you feel so euphoric."" Those brave enough to enter the cryotherapy chamber expose themselves to tingling temperatures of -130 degrees Celsius or -200 Fahrenheit. That makes Antarctica -- where NASA recorded the coldest spot on earth as -92 degrees Celsius at the end of December 2013 -- officially warmer. There are two types of cryotherapy treatments -- whole body and partial exposure -- but both involve serious sub-zero temperatures. ""It's not like sticking your hand in an ice bucket or taking an ice bath -- this is extreme cold,"" Liam Hennessy, Harrington's fitness coach and a world leading expert in cryotherapy, tells CNN. ""Whole body exposure is like stepping into a butcher's fridge. Partial exposure is more like entering a suntan cabin where the top of the head stays out of the cold. ""Padraig loves the challenge of taking whole body cryotherapy. He's a heavy worker. ""He has a huge practice and training regime. Part and parcel of the recovery process for him is cryotherapy."" The drafty drill sees Ireland's double British Open champion enter a TARDIS like chamber, which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to temperatures between -120 and -140 degrees Celsius. He will then experience what's known as a ""short exposure"" which lasts for two to three minutes. Cryotherapy was developed in 1978 by Toshima Yamauchi in Japan but is a relatively new treatment in professional sports medicine. The Olympic Sports Center in the Polish village of Spala helped the treatment spread west. Hennessy, in his role as director of fitness for the Irish Rugby Football Union, immersed his squad of international players in Spala's cryotherapy chamber in 2001. The respected Irish coach claims they were the first sports team in the world to formally use the facilities. Hennessy imported cryotherapy to Ireland and watched the freeze become a fashion. ""It's now taken off big time in Wales, England and France and Germany,"" he adds. ""The U.S. had no treatment centers in 2006 but now there are a couple of hundred."" But what are the effects of the big chill? Cryotherapy has two main benefits for maxed out sporting stars -- helping speed up the body's recovery after intense training and promoting a deeper sleep. ""Part of our investigations included taking serum and blood tests to monitor enzymes related to muscle damage,"" explains Hennessy, who ran a research program into cryotherapy. ""What we saw is that they returned to normal when players took part in cryotherapy compared to when they didn't. It improved the inflammatory response, which led to a better recovery. ""We've also seen heart rate variability -- which is a marker of stress -- returned to the baseline quicker if the athlete is exposed to cryotherapy. ""We noticed that sleep quality is also improved straight away by an exposure to cryotherapy. ""Individual athletes would report, 'I just had a good, deep sleep and I feel very good.' It's also possible to get a quality of sleep number by attaching a monitor to the wrist."" In a four-year study of 156 rugby players, 95% said cryotherapy had a positive effect on their recovery after training. ""Many of those that take it will tell you afterwards that they feel elated, they feel a rush of energy and a high as happy hormones are released,"" adds Hennessey. Mobile freezer Traditional cryotherapy chambers, with three rooms of gradually dropping temperatures, are an expensive and unwieldy piece kit -- not the sort of thing you can pack on the team bus. But cryotherapy has now gone mobile which means sports stars can order a deep freeze almost as easily as a hot takeaway. ""Having the unit on the road and available on a rental basis is opening cryotherapy up to an awful lot more people,"" Ian Bridge, managing director of cryotherapy consultants Sappari, tells CNN. In 2013, Bridge conceived the first mobile full body cryotherapy unit in the UK, which is owned and operated by medical and industrial gases specialist BOC. His clients include Premier League teams Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United as well as rugby union clubs such as Bath and Northampton. ""You can get a whole squad through the mobile unit in a day,"" Bridge explains ""The British Lions rugby players used it before their tour of Australia last year and did three treatments a day. ""They were dragging the guys out of bed before breakfast sticking them through cryo, they'd do some gym work in the morning, then go in for another session before lunch, do some work on the pitch and then another treatment at the end of the day. ""The mobile unit is predominantly used to stimulate a quicker recovery after training or games."" It costs up to $1,500 to hire the six-meter long unit for a day in the deep freeze. ""We find our bookings come in around the Champions League fixtures,"" says Bridge. ""It was in heavy use over the Christmas period because there was such a heavy football program."" Cryotherapy is not only the domain of fatigued footballers, its frosty fingers are also spreading to the high street. Legal doping The KryoLife center offers New Yorkers either a blast in its so-called ""cryosauna"" or a local treatment --increasingly used as part of a beauty regime to firm up skin -- where vaporized liquid nitrogen is blown over a specific part of the body. ""It is a growing industry,"" chairman Bohorquez, who brought cryotherapy to New York after receiving revelatory treatment in Poland on his injured right knee, tells CNN. ""There are a lot of famous people in the entertainment industry -- like actors Kevin Bacon and Ben Stiller -- and from the athletic world who use our center, so that has increased cryotherapy's popularity. ""Professional sports teams like the New York Knicks have a couple of machines which has also helped awareness."" You don't necessarily need a Hollywood salary to try cryotherapy -- it's probably cheaper than courtside Knicks tickets too -- because an icy blast in KryoLife's cryosauna costs $90. If the price continues to drop, along with the temperatures, is there a chance that cryotherapy will become as normal as having a sports massage or a protein shake? ""Yes, I truly believe so,"" says Bohorquez. ""Particularly the local treatment which is cheaper and less intimidating. ""I call cryotherapy legal doping because it boosts your energy levels and it makes your more alert. It increases your neuro-muscular response, so you react a little faster, and your immune system is activated. ""It boosts metabolism, which is also useful for weight loss, but it also stimulates your endocrine system so it relaxes you. ""I pretty much do it every day now,"" says Bohorquez cheerily. ""You should try it."""

But unfortunately for Sir Paul McCartney, his cartoon character has captured the looks of his ex-wife Heather Mills too. The shape of his face is identical to hers and the arched eyebrows, long nose and lips are also the same. In a recent letter to the comic, Sir Paul said: 'The Dandy was a favourite comic of mine when growing up in Liverpool and each week I would look forward to the exploits of Desperate Dan... I feel a little sadness that I see its final issue is appearing in December'. Now his dream's come true, except he looks like his ex, Heather Mills The 70-year-old is starring alongside Desperate Dan and friends in next week's final print issue of The Dandy The pair were married in 2002, but had a highly acrimonious £24million divorce six years later. The 70-year-old is starring alongside Desperate Dan and friends in next week’s final print issue of The Dandy. In February 1963 – a month before The Beatles released their first LP – the singer told music magazine NME that his personal ambition was ‘To have my picture in The Dandy!’ Almost 50 years later, he contacted the publication when it announced it would stop printing on its 75th birthday. Launched in 1937, The Dandy is Britain’s longest-running children’s comic. The pair (seen here in 2007) were married in 2002, but had a highly acrimonious £24m divorce six years later The Dandy's print editor, Craig Graham, said: 'When the decision was taken to stop printing The Dandy and take it online earlier this year, it really was a case of now or never' At its peak in the 1950s, it sold more than two million copies a week, but its circulation has since slumped to less than 8,000. In a recent letter to the publication, Sir Paul said: ‘The Dandy was a favourite comic of mine when growing up in Liverpool and each week I would look forward to the exploits of Desperate Dan and his other comic book colleagues. ‘I feel a little sadness that I see its final issue is appearing in December. 'In 1963, in the NME, when asked what my personal ambition was, I replied – to have my picture in The Dandy! I hope it’s not too late!’ In the final issue, Sir Paul’s cartoon persona will lead a sing-along with the comic’s most famous characters at a farewell party. The Dandy’s print editor, Craig Graham, said: ‘When the decision was taken to stop printing The Dandy and take it online earlier this year, it really was a case of now or never. 'Sir Paul wrote a lovely letter to us, wishing The Dandy well and hoping it wasn’t too late to make an appearance. How could we refuse?’ The last print issue of The Dandy will go on sale on Tuesday.

Kim Han-sik, chief executive officer of Cheonghaejin Marine Company, is being charged with ""causing death by negligence, as well as causing the capsizing of the ship in the line of duty,"" prosecutor Yang Joong-jin said. Kim also faces a charge of violating the ship safety act, Yang said, in connection with allegations that excessive cargo a played a role in the April 16 sinking. Investigators have said the cargo and the failure to tie it down properly was partially responsible for the sinking of the ferry Sewol, which was carrying 467 passengers and crew -- including more than 300 high school students on a field trip. Investigators said they've indicted four employees of the ferry's owner in the last two weeks, including a senior executive Tuesday. Details about the charges weren't immediately available. Authorities took aim at the cargo Tuesday, saying its weight was more than double the ship's limit. The cargo wasn't tied properly -- and the loosely tied goods helped cause the ship to capsize, Yang has said. Investigators had been probing the possibility the ship overturned because cargo shifted and forced the ship off balance. At least 269 people died in the disaster, which happened while the ferry was traveling from Incheon to the resort island of Jeju, off South Korea's southwestern coast. Thirty-five people still are unaccounted for, according to the country's coast guard. News of Kim's arrest comes nearly a week after South Korean authorities searched Cheonghaejin Marine's offices as part of a criminal investigation. This trip wasn't the first time the ferry had excess cargo, a joint investigation team told reporters Tuesday. Since the Sewol began the Incheon-Jeju route in March 2013, the ferry carried excess cargo 139 times, investigators said. Cheonghaejin Marine earned an extra 62 million South Korean won ($62,000) for the excess cargo on the April 16 voyage, and nearly 3 billion South Korean won ($2.9 million) in extra profit for all of the excess cargo that the ferry carried since March 2013, investigators said."

Michael L. Plumadore, 39, is charged with one count of murder in the death of Aliahna Lemmon, whose remains were found Monday night. She had been missing since Friday. Plumadore, described as a family friend, was being held without bond Tuesday after his initial court appearance. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. Allen County Sheriff Ken Fries told HLN's Nancy Grace on Tuesday night that comments by Plumadore during the investigation indicated he was key to solving the case. In the probable cause affidavit released Tuesday, investigators with the Allen County Sheriff's Department said Plumadore eventually admitted striking the girl repeatedly in the head with a brick while she stood on the front steps of his mobile home in the early hours of December 22. He stored the body in garbage bags in a freezer at his house until evening, according to the affidavit, when he allegedly began to dismember it with a hacksaw. Plumadore allegedly told investigators he threw parts of the body in a nearby commercial trash bin, but kept the head, hands and feet in his freezer, according to the document. The document does not disclose a motive for the girl's death. An autopsy was conducted, but Fries did not disclose the findings. Amber Story, the girl's grandmother, had described Plumadore as a neighbor and close family friend. She said Aliahna and her two sisters were staying with Plumadore for about a week while Aliahna's mother recovered from the flu. Prior to the suspect's arrest, Story said she believed the girl could have sleepwalked out of Plumadore's Fort Wayne home early Friday morning and been taken. She said Aliahna suffered from partial hearing loss and partial blindness and has gotten out of her home while sleepwalking before. Fries cited ""small inconsistencies"" in Plumadore's pre-arrest statements. Investigators did not believe the sleepwalking scenario, the sheriff told Grace. The sheriff said the case was an ""emotional roller coaster,"" with officials initially hoping Aliahna would be found alive. CNN's Deanna Proeller and Rick Martin contributed to this report."

Pablo Picasso immortalized mistress Dora Maar in his 1937 painting Weeping Woman, Andy Warhol catapulted model Edie Sedgwick to ""It Girl"" status in his 1960s avant-garde films, while Leonardo da Vinci made the woman behind his ""Mona Lisa"" perhaps the most famous muse of all time. But the elusive figure of the muse doesn't always have to be that of a beautiful woman. The dark beauty with flowing locks and sinewy limbs depicted in artist Michael Kirkbride's latest painting isn't a luscious lady -- it's a horse. Not just any horse, but arguably the greatest race horse of all time. Since demolishing the field in his first major win at the Royal Lodge Stakes in 2010, an air of mystique has followed world champion thoroughbred Frankel. The superstar colt, who even has its own twitter handle, has not just won all 14 of his races -- he has won them by staggering margins, destroying world-class fields,becoming by a distance the top-rated race horse on the planet. In his last race, the thoroughbred won the Champion Stakes at Ascot, with a sell-out crowd of 32,000 catching a final glimpse of the now-celebrity horse as as he powered to a dramatic victory. Writer Blaine Ward's personal ""Frankel moment"" came earlier in the horse's stellar career, an experience which later paved the way for artist Kirkbride to paint his unusual surrealist work. ""I had been watching last year's 2000 Guineas race on TV when Frankel just pounded the other horses into the ground,"" said Ward. ""He easily won by a good six lengths -- none of the others even came close. ""In my mind's eye I saw Frankel smashing through the screen into my living room; this powerful, beautiful, almost mythical beast."" A 51-year-old former solicitor from Sunderland in north-east England, Blaine was so moved by Frankel's win he wrote a poem about the centaur-like creature bursting into his suburban home in a blaze of glory. It read in part: ""Then a smell of burnt air mixed with horse-flesh when the telly exploded in his face as the Frankel centaur burst in green and pink silk, fluid powerful grace."" It was a special sporting moment and had a profound effect on Ward, who described Frankel's win as akin to watching boxer Muhammad Ali or footballer Lionel Messi in action. ""It was one of those rare times when you get a sense you've just witnessed somebody or something at the very pinnacle of sporting prowess,"" he said. ""Mere words are never good enough to do it justice."" And so Ward enlisted Kirkbride, a lecturer at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London (RADA) to paint the champion horse powering into a suburban living room, knocking Ward and his wife from their chairs and spilling their afternoon gin and tonics to the floor. ""The result is a surreal cocktail of his words and my interpretation in art form,"" Kirkbride said. ""The modern domestic scene is shattered by the magisterial beast that is Frankel."" Kirkbride painted the work, called ""Armchair Ride,"" in egg tempura; a mixture of colored pigment and egg yolk which dates back to the 1st Century. The method, which gives a luminous quality, was later superseded by oil painting around the 15th Century. ""It has a kind of stained glass quality to it, like shining a light from behind,"" said Kirkbride. ""The pinks and blues of Frankel's silks are quite strong and I thought they really lent themselves to the medium."" Kirkbride is perhaps best known for his paintings of English football scenes, such as ""Chech Mates,"" which captures the unusual tradition of Chelsea fans throwing celery, or ""Bar Kick,"" which portrays sporting revelry in a pub. After Saturday though, and Kirkbride will be painting fabulous Frankel smashing not just a TV screen, but the record books all over again."

Don't forget the green bean casserole, sweet potato gratin, mashed potatoes and dinner rolls. And despite the lavish spread, the president himself will be picking up the bill. Gary Walters, who was chief White House usher for many years, said the payment rule dates back to 1800 when the White House was first occupied by President John Adams and there was no staff. Presidents brought staff with them and paid for everything. Congress gradually began spending money to maintain an official White House staff to oversee operations and maintenance, but presidents continued to pay for personal expenses. What it boils down to, Walters said, is that the White House is first and foremost the president's home. The president said in his weekly radio and Internet address that the first family planned to spend the day with friends and family - catching up, eating good food and watching some football. He says Thanksgiving is his favorite holiday 'because, more than any other, it is uniquely American.' Obama also called U.S. troops to thank them for their service - a tradition he often upholds on Thanksgiving. On Wednesday Obama and his family handed out canned and fresh vegetables and bread to clients of Bread for the City, a center in southeast Washington that provides food, clothing and other services to the poor. They were joined by Michelle Obama's mother Marion Robinson. In time-honored tradition he also pardoned the National Thanksgiving Turkey.

He also spared an alternate turkey, a 47-pounder named Mac. Both came from Cooper Farms in Oakwood, Ohio. 'If you're a turkey, and you're named after a side dish, your chances of escaping Thanksgiving dinner are pretty low,' Obama said at the annual event, which drew international media coverage. He was accompanied by his daughters, Malia and Sasha, who declined his invitation to pet the birds. 'No,' Malia said. The ceremony was moved indoors because of cold, wet weather that blanketed Washington. 'So these guys are well ahead of the curve. They really beat the odds,' he said of Mac and Cheese.

In a study of almost 700 English mothers and their children, they found that the more of the so-called sunshine vitamin a woman had in her blood during pregnancy, the stronger her child’s grip at the age of four. It is thought that vitamin D has an effect on the way muscle fibres grow in the womb, helping them to work harder in later life. Young people with strong muscles have been shown to be less susceptible to debilitating falls and fractures in old age, and have more protection against diabetes. Nicholas Harvey, of Southampton University, said the research published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism added to evidence that showed the seeds for the diseases that plague the elderly are sown early in life. Although vitamin D is found in oily fish and other foods, it is mostly created by our bodies when our skin is exposed to sunlight. The British climate means many people struggle to make enough of it, and pregnant women are advised to take daily supplements. But around a third of white women and up to 90 per cent of black and Asian women in England have low levels during pregnancy. Dr Harvey and fellow researcher Dr Rebecca Moon used data from a long-running health study in Southampton to compare the vitamin D levels of pregnant women with how tightly their children could squeeze a pressure sensor at the age of four. British researchers found that by the age of four, children whose mothers took vitamin D during their pregnancy had stronger grips and greater muscle mass All pregnant and breastfeeding women are advised to take a daily vitamin D supplement of 10 micrograms. Vitamin D regulates the amount of calcium in the body, which helps to keep bones and teeth strong and healthy, as well as providing a baby with enough vitamin D in their first months. All pregnant and breastfeeding women, particularly teenagers and young women, are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. The people most at risk are those who spend long periods inside without much sunlight and people of South Asian or Caribbean descent as darker skin foes not produce as much vitamin D in response to sunlight. Source: NHS Start4Life They said increased strength at four was likely to have positive consequences decades later because strong children tend to grow into strong adults. The importance of vitamin D in pregnancy is underlined by another study that found children born to women with low levels had weaker bones as adults. Muscles also play a role in regulating hormones, so less muscle raises the risk of diabetes. Vitamin D is known to be essential to bone health and the Government advises mothers-to-be to take ten micrograms a day. The research is one of a growing number of studies to credit vitamin D with benefits beyond boosting bone health. These include helping to ward off Alzheimer’s, keeping the heart healthy and prostate cancer under control and preventing multiple sclerosis. Greater muscle strength observed at four years of age in children born to mothers with higher vitamin D levels could one day help to reduce the burden of illness associated with loss of muscle mass in old age.

Democratic leaders, and even some Republicans, quoted the 70,000 number frequently this week to emphasize the serious consequences of the shutdown. But George Mason University professor Stephen Fuller, whose 3-year-old study was used by others to arrive at the 70,000 figure, said the estimate includes everything from actual construction workers, who were laid off, to drug store clerks and restaurant waitresses, who might see ""a tiny bit less revenue flow."" The true number of laid-off construction workers is probably one-third of that figure, Fuller told CNN. The rampant use -- and misuse -- of the 70,000 figure is a study in the wondrous ways of Washington, where facts and figures frequently enter the public debate filled with nuance and caveats, all of which are rapidly abandoned in the blazing heat of partisan battle. The 70,000 figure entered the public sphere when the FAA turned to Associated General Contractors of America, a construction industry group, to calculate the economic impact of the FAA funding impasse. The FAA had halted more than 200 construction projects totaling $2.5 billion. AGC dusted off the 3-year-old study conducted by Fuller. His research, designed to show the ""multiplier effect"" of the president's stimulus package, concluded in early 2009 that $1 billion in nonresidential construction created or supported 28,500 jobs and added $3.4 billion to the Gross Domestic Product. An AGC economist applied Fuller's formula to the FAA's $2.5 billion construction halt and came to the conclusion that it would put ""24,000 construction workers out of work."" Another 11,000 workers in related businesses ""are also affected,"" the AGC said, and ""as many as 35,000 jobs will be undermined in the broader economy, from the lunch wagon near the job site to the truck dealership across town."" The total number impacted -- in ways large and small -- was 70,000, the AGC said. In a subsequent Department of Transportation news releases and statements, the information was abbreviated, losing much of its important nuance. ""AGC estimates that 70,000 construction workers and workers in related fields have been affected,"" the DOT reported in one news release. A DOT media advisory blurred the picture stating flatly ""70,000 construction workers and workers in related fields have been laid off."" The number lost even more clarity on Monday, when Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood appeared at a news conference near one shutdown construction project. ""Seventy thousand construction workers are out of work today -- 70,000! -- and here we are right smack dab in the middle of the construction season in America,"" LaHood said. (In a slip of the tongue, LaHood also misstated the purpose of the LaGuardia airport project. ""This tower needs to be built,"" he said, gesturing towards a control tower that is being demolished.) Others also cited the 70,000 figure. ""More than 70,000 construction jobs around the country... are on hold,"" Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, said in a written statement. Some apparently added the nearly 4,000 FAA employees who have been furloughed to the total. The dispute is ""keeping 74,000 people from working,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday. Some apparently rounded up. ""Seventy-five thousand people are now over the precipice,"" Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said at a Wednesday news conference. ""We have 80,000 jobs at least on the line,"" said Majority Leader Harry Reid at one briefing Tuesday. (President Obama, in comments Wednesday, fudged, referring to ""tens of thousands of construction workers being suspended..."") On Wednesday, the AFL-CIO Executive Council got into the action. In a news release, it said House Republicans ""jeopardized 90,000 airport construction jobs."" Two sentences later, it went for the brass ring: ""Congress must (act) to preserve almost 100,000 American jobs,"" it said. ACG spokesman Brian Turmail, a former government spokesman, said he believes the politicians' misstatements were innocent in nature. ""I don't have any impression that people are manipulating the numbers, but events are moving so fast that everyone needs to take a deep breath and make sure that we're all working with the same data,"" he said. ""I think everyone's frustrated that we're in the predicament."" ""I'd just want to stress that we have been very careful to explain in all our communications that the 70,000 figure reflects the broader impact of halting airport construction jobs across the country,"" Turmail said. Fuller, meanwhile, says the FAA should be able to release the actual number of laid off construction workers, making estimates unnecessary. The 70,000 number, while hard to wrap one's head around, still might strike some at the FAA as questionably large. It is well above the total number of employees in the agency, which stands at about 47,500."

During last summer's unparalleled talent drain, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert all left St Mary's in favour of a move to Anfield. Those exits came at a reported combined cost of £49million and compounded the departures of head coach Mauricio Pochettino, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw. Nathaniel Clyne is confident Southampton can beat top-four rivals Liverpool at St Mary's a week on Sunday The England full back helped Saints keep their 12th clean sheet of the season against West Ham Saints, though, have confounded those expecting them to struggle, with Ronald Koeman's men sitting fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings with 13 matches remaining. Liverpool, four points worse off in seventh, are next up and England right-back Clyne is well aware of the importance of overcoming his former team-mates. 'It is another game we're looking forward to playing,' he said. 'We know Liverpool are a good side. 'It is going to be another tough test for us, but I am sure if we play like we did (against West Ham) we can go and get the three points we're looking for.' Ronald Koeman's high-flying Saints have defied the odds by remaining in the top-four with 13 games to play Put to Clyne that the match looked important in the top-four battle, he said: 'Yeah, definitely. 'I mean, if we get the win then we can push for that top four and hopefully we can stay there for the rest of the season.' To overcome Liverpool, Saints will need to show a cutting edge that has been missing in recent games at St Mary's. Koeman's side have not won in four successive home matches in all competitions, with the 10 men of West Ham the latest to leave with a smile on their face. Clyne believes Southampton have found it difficult to break teams down at home because teams defend deep 'I think teams are coming up against us and making it really difficult for us to play,' Clyne said after Wednesday's goalless draw. 'I think they are coming to play counter-attacking football, which means that we have to try and break them down. 'Yeah, it makes it difficult but we're up for the challenge.' Southampton have certainly proved up to the challenge defensively, with their record of 12 clean sheets and just 17 goals conceded the best in the Premier League. The right back makes an acrobatic attempt to clear the ball during the draw with Southampton 'I think we've been solid all season, really,' Clyne added. 'We've got the best defensive record in the Premier League. 'We know if we keep that up, we know we can always go and win the game. 'It's been a great season. No one expected us to be where we are at the moment, but we're flying high at the moment. 'The confidence in the team and the morale's high and we're playing good football and we're looking good.'"

In the interview,  Bishop Williamson denied the Nazis had used gas chambers at concentration camps. The Vatican has been under fire since Pope Benedict XVI lifted the excommunication of Bishop Richard Williamson almost two weeks ago, days after Swedish Public Television broadcast an interview in which Williamson said the Nazis had not systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II. Israel Wednesday blasted the rehabilitation of Williamson. ""The reinstatement of a Holocaust denier by the Holy See offends every Jew, in Israel and around the world, and humiliates the memory of all Holocaust victims and survivors,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. It said the Church's distancing itself from Williamson's position was ""the first step in the right direction"" and said it expected ""more explicit and unequivocal decisions and statements on this issue."" Israel's statement appears to have been made before the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, said Williamson would not be allowed to perform priestly functions if he did not recant. Williamson's position on the Holocaust is ""absolutely unacceptable and firmly rejected by the Pope,"" Bertone said. He added that Williamson's views on the Holocaust ""were unknown to the Holy Father at the time of the excommunication's remission."" Williamson was rehabilitated on January 21 along with three other members of the ultra-conservative Society of Saint Pius X. The move was announced three days later. Bertone's order comes only two days after he declared the matter ""closed."" ""The Society of Saint Pius X has distanced itself from its bishop and apologized to the pope for this embarrassing incident. The pope spoke clearly on Wednesday (January 28). I think the question can be considered closed,"" Bertone, said, according the Catholic daily Avvenire Tuesday. But on Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded that the pope firmly reject denial of the Holocaust. Earlier on Wednesday, a German district attorney said he had launched a criminal investigation into Williamson's remarks. ""I believe that the historical evidence is strongly against -- is hugely against -- 6 million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler,"" Williamson said in the Swedish interview, which also appeared on various Web sites after broadcast. ""I believe there were no gas chambers."" Regensburg District Attorney Guenther Ruckdaeschel said authorities were investigating whether the remarks can be considered ""inciting racial hatred."" Denying the Holocaust is a crime in Germany, punishable by up to five years in prison. American Jewish leaders have also expressed outrage that Williamson, who was excommunicated in 1988, was welcomed back to the church days after the interview. Williamson and three other bishops who belong to the Society of Saint Pius X were excommunicated by Pope John Paul II in 1988. The society was founded by Archbishop Marcel Lefebrve, who rebelled against the Vatican's modernizing reforms in the 1960s, and who consecrated the men in unsanctioned ceremonies. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said when the controversy erupted that the Vatican's decision to accept Williamson was part of its desire to normalize relations with the ultra-conservative group, and had nothing to do with the bishop's personal views. Ruckdaeschel decided to launch his investigation in Regensburg because the Williamson interview was conducted at a seminar of the Society of Saint Pius X, of which Williamson is a member, in the nearby town of Zaitzkofen. Ruckdaeschel told CNN that a legal representative for Williamson contacted him and said the bishop denied the allegations. Williamson apologized last week for the ""distress"" his remarks caused the pope, but did not retract them. According to the legal representative's account, Williamson had told the Swedish reporters he did not want the interview aired outside Sweden -- and therefore, the remarks would not fall under German criminal law. According to the German criminal code, comments glorifying or denying crimes committed by the Nazis, or National Socialists, are a crime only if they are made publicly. Ruckdaeschel says he will attempt to question the two Swedish reporters who conducted the interview. He said it was unlikely Williamson would have to appear in court because he is currently in Argentina, but the bishop may be required to submit a written statement in the case. The pope -- who was born in Germany and was a child during the Nazi period -- rejected Holocaust denial in public statements on January 28. After his 14th birthday in 1941, Benedict -- then called Joseph Ratzinger -- was forced along with the rest of his class in Bavaria, southern Germany, to join the Hitler Youth. However his biographer John Allen Jr., said Ratzinger's family was strongly anti-Nazi. CNN's Hada Messia and Alessio Vinci in Rome and Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin contributed to this report."

Mandela's grandson, tribal chieftain Mandla Mandela (above), denies claims he sold rights to his grandfather's funeral for £250,000 Nelson Mandela's grandson has been forced to deny that he secretly sold television broadcast rights for the anti-apartheid icon's funeral to the BBC. Mandla Mandela has been accused of selling exclusive rights to film the anti-apartheid campaigner's funeral for around £250,000. The tribal chieftain, 37, is alleged to have cut a deal with the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) in conjunction with the BBC. Mandla's first wife Thando claimed he made the deal in 2009 - well before his grandfather, now 93, experienced his recent bout of health problems. She claimed he received three million South African rand (£248,000) for the arrangement. As part of the couple's divorce battle Thando Mabunu-Mandela has forced her ex-husband - now a leading figure within the Mandela family - to make a legal statement on issue. And this week Mandla Mandela told a court: 'I am not in possession of any written agreement with either the SABC or BBC or any other broadcasting company or corporation for the broadcast rights to Mr Nelson Mandela's funeral, as such agreement does not exist and I do not possess such rights.' Icon: The former South Africa president celebrates his 93rd birthday with family members in July last year. He has been in ailing health and last month underwent surgery for a stomach complaint Using the term 'M-plans', the world's news organisations have for years been planning how best to cover Nelson Mandela's funeral. They have staked out locations, booked hotels and even pre-arranged pundits in anticipation of a global news event to which every living US president, the British prime minister and many other world leaders are expected to attend. The intense level of preparation is, from a television executive's perspective, understandable. But many South Africans have been offended by the sense of anticipation of the much-loved statesman's death. So great is the national affection for the country's first black president that any perceived lack of respect for his dignity is taken extremely seriously. Much-loved: Many South Africans are offended by the anticipation surrounding Mr Mandela's death The recent revelation that two international news agencies - Associated Press and Reuters - had installed television cameras on top of telegraph poles in Nelson Mandela's home village of Qunu provoked fury locally, despite the fact that the cameras were turned off and would only be activated when the funeral started. Mandla has also attracted criticism for ordering that the bodies of three of the former president's children be exhumed from their home village of Qunu and reburied in the nearby hamlet of Mvezo where he is a chief. Mandla's motive, say his critics - some of whom are within the Mandela family itself - that the former president will also be buried in Mvezo: something that is sure to act as a lure for big-spending tourists. Mandla Mandela's personal life has also been criticised. While polygamy is legal in South African tribal law, he has been accused of breaching a court's order to marry his second and third wives while divorce proceedings against the first are still active. Nelson Mandela, now 93, has previously been treated for prostate cancer, tuberculosis and damage to his eyes. Last month, he underwent surgery for a stomach condition."

In 1971, he borrowed a small statue of an owl protecting its babies because it symbolized his mother's efforts to care for him and his brother.

Out in front of the peloton for over 200km, Bauer was desperately holding on to his lead as he approached the finishing line in Nimes only for Alexander Kristoff of Norway to lead a surging group of sprinters past him. Kristoff took the victory, Bauer could only finish 10th and with tears in his eyes. The Garmin-Sharp rider had been in the breakaway with Swiss champion Martin Elmiger and on the run from Tallard built a lead of over eight minutes. But slowly it was whittled away and with a kilometer to go was down to just over 10 seconds. Bauer was the stronger of the duo and made his run for the finish to be denied by Katusha fast man Kristoff, who was claiming his second stage win of the 2014 Tour. Race leader Vincenzo Nibali retained his four minutes 37 second advantage over Alejandro Valverde after an uneventful stage for the yellow jersey contenders following two days in the Alps. It left the way clear for the sprinters but Bauer looked set to spoil their day with his gallant but in the end fruitless effort. ""It's just bitter, bitter disappointment,"" he told the official Tour de France website. ""It's a childhood dream to win a stage of the Tour and for a domestique, like myself, I'm normally working for others. ""This was my first chance to be up the road and with the chance in the wind and the weather, me and Martin realized we had a chance for the win. ""I faked to be tired but felt I had more punch left. I left it until 400. I thought I had it but then I realized in the last 50m that I had nothing. German Heinrich Haussler finished second behind Kristoff, with green jersey holder Peter Sagan in third. Monday is a rest day as the contenders take stock ahead of the challenge of the Pyrenees and the only time trial of the race which may well decide the podium positions."

Kelly Helleson was sentenced to two years’ probation and ordered to pay a $2,000 fine stemming from a July 13, 2012, traffic stop in Irving involving Angel Dobbs and her niece. Scroll down for videos Punishment: Kelly Helleson was sentenced to two years' probation and ordered to pay a $2,000 fne for conducting an unwarranted body cavity search in July 2012 The women sued the Department of Public Safety claiming that State Trooper Helleson inserted her hands inside their vaginas and anuses without changing the latex gloves. The law enforcement agency eventually settled with the plaintiffs for $185,000. In court Friday, Ms Helleson apologized for acting ‘injudiciously’ and causing pain with her actions, but denied touching anyone's private parts, the station NBC5 reported. ‘At no time did I ever stick my finger inside any part of anyone's body - that never happened,’ Helleson stated in court. She also added that Dobbs and her niece smelled of marijuana during the traffic stop, and she was merely doing what she was trained to do as a state trooper. Angel Dobbs also took the stand during sentencing, telling the court that the cavity search has affected every aspect of her life and shaken her trust in police. Invasive: Female trooper Kelley Helleson, left, aggressively searched Ashley Dobbs, 24 Out: State trooper David Ferrell, pictured, has been suspended after subjecting two women to invasive body cavity searches Pulled over: The women were initially stopped by Helleson's colleague David Farrell on State Highway 161 near Irving, Texas The woman recalled that when she first complained about Helleson's conduct to the DPS, she was allegedly threatened with criminal charges. ‘No woman should have their body unnecessarily violated in this type of way. This was a gross invasion of the victim's privacy and violation of the public's trust,’ said Dallas District Attorney Craig Watkins. Helleson, a retired U.S. Marine, was fired last January after serving 10 years on the force, CBS DFW reported. On Friday, the judge dismissed the more serious sexual assault charges Helleson had been facing. If she violates the terms of her probation, she will be sent to jail. Also, the former trooper has been barred from working in law enforcement. The case made national headlines and led DPS to prohibit troopers from conducting cavity searches without warrants. Impact statement: Angel Dobbs told the court that the cavity search had shaken her faith in law enforcement Friday marked the first time that a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper was convicted for conducting an illegal body cavity search. The 'unconstitutional' search of Ms Dobbs and her niece, Ashley, took place in full view of passing cars on State Highway 161, near Irving, on the night of July 13, 2012. Ashley and Angel Dobbs claimed Trooper Helleson used the same blue latex gloves while searching both of them. The women were initially pulled over by Trooper David Farrell after he saw one of them throw a cigarette butt out the window. Farrell can be heard in the disturbing video questioning the pair about marijuana after supposedly smelling the drug in the women's vehicle, though he failed to find any evidence of it in the car. Despite that, he requested the women be searched by his female colleague because they were 'acting weird.' Violating: Helleson, pictured left, also rubbed the women's breasts Lawsuit: The women are also suing the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety for ignoring prior complaints about searches Humiliating: Angel Dobbs, 38, pictured right, claims she will never forget the humiliating, invasive experience 'Unconstitutional': The search is being deemed unconstitutional in the lawsuit The Dobbs' lawyer, Scott H. Palmer, said the shocking incident, which was filmed on one of the trooper's dash-mounted cameras, was a roadside 'sexual assault.' He said the Texas Rangers investigated his clients' complaints but failed to take any action against the troopers. The women said the 'molestation' has scarred them for life. 'I've never been so humiliated or so violated or felt so molested in my entire life,' Angel Dobbs told NBCDFW.com. Her niece added: 'I don't think anybody needs to have to feel, or go through what we went through. It crosses my mind every day. It's humiliating.' The trooper who called Helleson to do the search, David Farrell, was indicted on a theft charge for allegedly lifting a bottle of pills from one of the women's purse, but that count was later dropped.

Eva Machan's horse Painted Paula, or PP for short, died after eating seeds which can cause organ failure and muscle weakness in horses They contain a toxin called hypoglycin A. Horses eating them can develop atypical myopathy, a condition which causes muscle weakness and organ failure. It is fatal in four out of five cases. Eva, from Henley-on-Thames, had had her pet, known affectionately as PP, since May and she and her five-year-old sister Zara rode her nearly every day. She loved caring for the pony, mucking out her stables and feeding her grass and oats. Mrs Machan said Eva, who goes to the Abbey School in Reading, has been devastated and ‘very tearful’ over the animal’s death. Mrs Machan noticed something was wrong when they took the chestnut-and-white pony to a gymkhana at Addington, near Bicester. She said: ‘She was a bit sluggish. About half an hour later she literally just stopped walking – she stopped dead and wouldn’t move.’ Vets assumed PP had cramps and treated her with muscle relaxants and pain relief. But within a few days she deteriorated so much she had to be put down.

Elizabeth Escalona, 23, was in a Dallas County, Texas, court Monday as witnesses -- including her mother and the pediatrician who cared for the toddler -- testified in the first day of her sentencing hearing, while prosecutors showed pictures of the little girl's hands and bruised body and forehead. ""The entire picture was very shocking,"" said Dr. Amy Barton, then a child abuse pediatrician at Children's Medical Center of Dallas, choking back tears on the stand. ""I see a lot of children, and this was one of the most shocking cases that I have seen."" Jocelyn Cedillo was less than two months shy of her third birthday in September 2011 when Escalona, her mother, used a powerful adhesive to glue her hands to a wall and beat her. Three other children of Escalona, who was pregnant at the time, witnessed the abuse, according to Dallas County district attorney's office spokeswoman Debbie Denmon. The child urinated on herself during the ordeal, during which she was hit in head and kicked in the groin, among other forms of abuse, said Denmon. Oefelia Escalona, the defendant's mother, testified Monday that she found the girl and took her to the hospital. ""I saw Jocelyn laying in the bed. She was facing the wall and ...,"" the 42-year-old woman said, before she started crying and turned away. It wasn't clear exactly how long young Jocelyn was glued to the wall before she was brought to the Dallas hospital. Once there, medical authorities noticed severe bruises to her face and head, as well as a severe brain injury that led to her temporarily being in a coma. Escalona pleaded guilty on July 12 to a charge of first-degree injury to a child, a crime punishable by anywhere between five years and life in prison. Prosecutors are asking Escalona be incarcerated for 45 years, so she will not cause any more harm to her children, Denmon said. ""When these types of crimes occur we have to send a message, not only to the perpetrator, but to the citizens of Dallas County as a whole,"" District Attorney Craig Watkins told CNN. ""If you choose to commit these types of crimes, we will ensure that you receive an adequate punishment."" Prior to this incident, Escalona had been investigated by Texas Child Protective Services but never arrested or charged, said Denmon.

The fascinating audio recordings, made public today by the National Archives and Records Administration, capture some 3,700 hours of taped conversations between February 1971 and July 1973, with the most interesting those regarding the scandal that did, ultimately, see Nixon's head roll. President Nixon is also heard in the tapes, referring to the media as 'a law to themselves' with regards to the leaks. 'Press gets so concerned about this... bugging... why should they be a law to themselves? Why should they have a license to steal?' The recordings reveal that, in the hours after Nixon delivered a public Watergate address as the scandal exploded, two future presidents called him to express their private support - Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr. Scroll down for audio Tapes: In this April 29, 1974, file photo, President Richard M. Nixon points to the transcripts of the White House tapes after he announced during a nationally-televised speech that he would turn over the transcripts to House impeachment investigators, in Washington The April 30, 1973, calls were captured on a secret recording system that Nixon regularly used to tape discussions with colleagues in Washington as well as his foreign counterparts. The final chronological installment of those tapes — 340 hours — were made public by the National Archives and Records Administration, along with more than 140,000 pages of text documents. Seven hundred hours remain sealed for national security and privacy reasons. Reagan, then-California Governor, called late in the evening of April 30 to support Nixon after the 37th president delivered a landmark speech about the Watergate scandal, which was rapidly ensnaring him. Two top White House staffers and close Nixon confidants, H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, had resigned earlier in the day, as well as Attorney General Richard Kleindienst as the scandal picked up speed. White House counsel John W. Dean III was also fired that day. Reagan told Nixon the speech was the right one to make and sympathized with the staff exodus. 'I just want you to know, we watched and my heart was with you. I know what this must have been and what this must have been in all these days and what you've been through,' Reagan said. 'You can count on us, we're still behind you out here and I wanted you to know that you're in our prayers.' Reagon went on: 'I know how difficult it was, and I know what it must be with the fellows having to do what they did-' before Nixon cut him off: 'That's right, they had to get out.' Pals: The tapes also include conversations between Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, left, and President Richard M. Nixon from 1973 Audio Source Nixon Presidential Library & Museum At the end of the call, Reagan added to the President: 'This too shall pass,' to which Nixon responded 'Everything passes.' But it didn't. That same evening, George Bush Sr., who had recently been appointed chairman of the Republican National Committee, called to say he had watched the speech with 'great pride.' This time, however, an angry and exhausted-sounding Nixon complained to Bush about the reaction from TV commentators. 'The folks may understand,' Nixon said, before adding later: 'To hell with the commentators.' Other interesting quotes pulled from the tapes by Nixon biographer John Aloysius Farrell include a conversation between the President and Kissinger in which they discussed what J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the FBI, would have done had he been alive for Watergate. Kissinger said: 'If J. Edgar Hoover had been alive he would have handled Watergate for you in a way in which it would never have surfaced.' To which Nixon replied: 'Hoover would have had these clowns nailed for misdemeanors and given them a few weeks in the hoosegow and out!' Kissinger then added: 'And started blackmailing a few newsmen and this thing would have worked out.' 'Yeah. He (Hoover) blackmailed,' Nixon responded. Evidence: The original Nixon White House tape and original tape recorder are shown in an undated file photo from the National Archives. The last 340 hours of tapes from President Richard M. Nixon's White House were released Wednesday, August 21, 2013 Of his adviser Leonard Garment, Nixon is heard saying: 'Goddamn his Jewish soul!' Wednesday's tapes also include topics such as Vietnam, energy and a lengthy recording of Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev chatting warmly in the Oval Office before a historic summit in June 1973. Nixon and Brezhnev met one-on-one with only an interpreter present for an hour on June 18 and chatted about personal topics, including their families. The conversation happened before the start of a historic seven-day summit that was part of Nixon's larger strategy of detente with the Soviet Union. 'We must recognize, the two of us, that ... we head the two most powerful nations and, while we will naturally in negotiations have some differences, it is essential that those two nations, where possible, work together,' Nixon told Brezhnev. 'If we decide to work together, we can change the world. That's what — that's my attitude as we enter these talks.' The conversation is remarkable because of the camaraderie that is evident, said Luke Nichter of Texas A&M University-Central Texas in Killeen, who runs a website cataloging Nixon's secret recordings. Both men discuss their children and Brezhnev even talks about his grandson's attempts to pass college entrance exams. 'These are Cold War archenemies who are talking like old friends,' he said. 'This is very unusual.' The recordings were released at the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda and cover April 9, 1973, to July 12, 1973, the day before the existence of the covert recording system was revealed to a Senate committee probing Watergate. Previous tape releases show the president as a paranoid man who was not afraid to use bare-knuckle tactics to crush the enemies he saw all around him. Tapes released in 2009 show, in particular, Nixon's obsession with the Kennedy family. He considered Ted Kennedy such a political threat, for example, that he ordered surveillance in hopes of catching him in an affair. Nixon's second term was quickly overrun by the Watergate scandal, which began in 1972 when burglars tied to his re-election committee broke into the Democratic headquarters to get dirt on his political adversaries. Faced with impeachment and a possible criminal indictment, Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 — a little more than a year after the tapes end — and retreated to his native California, where he was pardoned a month later by his successor, Gerald Ford. The Nixon Foundation released a statement regarding the release of the latest installment of tapes defending his presidency. 'Today's release of White House Records from the National Archives offers a classroom on major achievements of the Nixon Presidency,' the Foundation wrote."

Her 11-year tenure at the high court was marked by the landmark 2006 case where Botswana's Bushmen took the government to court over the right to live and hunt in the central Kalahari game reserve. In what is the southern African country's longest and most expensive trial to date, Dow ruled that the Bushmen should be allowed to return to their ancestral lands. The case attracted widespread international attention and came to define Dow's career at the high court that ended in 2009. Today, 53-year-old Dow is a partner in her own law firm, a successful author and a prominent activist championing women's rights. It's all a far cry from growing up in a dusty rural village on the outskirts of Gaborone, Botswana's capital. ""I was born into a Botswana where there was no tar road, no telephone. I think I saw my first refrigerator when I was a teenager,"" remembers Dow, 53. ""I grew up in a Botswana where you had to hold water on your head and hold firewood as well."" Despite the tough conditions and the initial objections of her family, Dow decided to pursue a career in law following advice from one of her teachers. After high school, she went to Swaziland to continue her studies before spending two years at Edinburgh University, Scotland, where she found herself one of very few women in the law faculty. While making her first professional steps, Dow says she quickly came across an innate gender inequality built into law. ""When you start to practice you realize how just the language of the law is so male, the culture of the law is so male,"" she says. ""You're beginning to think, 'I don't think it should be like this, I have a right to be here, I've earned the right to be here and therefore this whole environment should be about me as well."" Read more: In pictures: Africa's power women Dow went on to work with great success as a criminal prosecutor and a criminal defense attorney in Botswana. But her reputation shot up in the early 1990s when she was the plaintiff in a groundbreaking case that dealt with citizenship rights through the mothers of newborns. ""I was married to a non-citizen, and therefore my children were born to a Botswana and an American,"" she explains. ""I was shocked to realize that in terms of the law my children were not Botswana citizens because I was not male."" Dow thought the law was unfair and embarked on a mission to make it unconstitutional. The long-running legal battle attracted huge media coverage in Botswana. ""Suddenly I was being unpatriotic by bringing this case, I was being un-cultural, I was influenced by my foreign training, I was not behaving like a normal nice wife,"" she says describing some of the comments directed toward her during the trial. ""There were times where I was really energized, feeling I'm going to win this battle; there were times where I really felt so despondent; there were times when I felt so angry, and I think I cried many more times during that period than any other time in my life."" But after five long years, Dow won the case, managing not only to change the law on citizenship and give men and women equal rights, but also influencing other laws. ""After that the government actually commissioned a study to say what other laws discriminate against women and over a period of time those began to be changed,"" she says. ""I think now in terms of the legislative framework, the legal framework, we have a fairly decent equality provisions across the board."" Dow also co-founded the AIDS Action Trust to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and the Women and Law in Southern Africa Research Project, an initiative aiming to empower women in the region. ""We did studies on child support and how culture influences the law on child support; we looked at access to property by women; we looked at widowhood and widowhood ceremonies, the extent to which they strengthen and you know undermine women,"" she says. ""It was really a chance to actually talk within southern Africa."" But when she's not fighting legal battles or promoting human rights, Dow is busy spending her time penning novels, exploring issues such as gender conflicts, the contradictions between traditional and western values and the AIDS pandemic. And now, after spending last decades studying the law and fighting for a more equal legal system, Dow says her next target is to join the political arena -- a move that will enable her to put forward her own ideas. Chart: Women in Africa's parliaments ""I'm a lawyer and I've been a judge, but there's one thing that I have not done so far and that is to make laws,"" she says. ""I would love a plan to join politics and to run for a political office as a member of parliament and therefore join the legislature."" Determined and ambitious, Dow admits that running for public office won't be the end of her impressive life journey. ""Nothing ends until you're dead,"" she says. ""So no, it will not end there."""

Drive around and stop to see mangrove trees, the Belize Barrier Reef that almost touches the shore and lagoons teeming with crocodiles. Maya ruins of Lamanai Some use Belize as the entry point to Tikal, the famed ruins in Guatemala, but it is also home to several ancient Maya cities. One of the more interesting is Lamanai, which was still occupied by the Maya when the Spanish first arrived. The cultural collision is forever noted here, between the pyramids and the ruins of two Spanish churches.

Family and friends of Huma Abedin, 38, told People magazine that she began to beat herself up because Weiner returned to phone sex after they stopped going to couple's therapy and their new baby began to take up more of her time. However, after returning to counseling, she now feels she and Weiner are closer than ever despite revelations he continued to send lewd pictures of himself to women, including 22-year-old Sydney Leathers, who has heaped embarrassment on Abedin by making claims about her husbands sexual fetishes in her numerous media appearances. Humiliation: New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin attend a news conference in New York last month While Abedin's decision to stand by her shamed husband in the wake of last month's latest episode has disappointed many of her would-be supporters, her friends claimed in People that she stayed with her cheating husband for the sake of their child and to 'help' her husband. 'She was seriously thinking, 'Maybe I can't do this.' There was the possibility of leaving on the table,' one family member told the magazine. 'It would have been perfectly logical if she had said, 'I'm out of here,' said family friend, Rory Tahari to the magazine. 'Any woman could have understood that.'

Their friends let People Magazine know that former Hilary Clinton political aide Abedin's suffered huge doubt about their marriage during a Hamptons vacation one year ago. 'All the parties they had once been invited to, Huma was now invited to but Anthony wasn't,' a family member said. 'It was a difficult time.' However, the worst was yet to come. Just one month later after the Hampton's debacle, Weiner confessed that as their marriage deteriorated he had returned to sexting women lewd pictures of himself. He also confessed to frequent phone sex with 22-year-old Sydney Leathers and sending pictures of himself to two other women under the pseudonym Carlos Danger. Loyal: Huma Abedin, alongside her husband, New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, speaks during a news conference at the Gay Men's Health Crisis headquarters, Tuesday, July 23, 2013, in New York However, instead of leaving her husband, Abedin resolved to stay for the sake of their 19-month-old son. 'Huma has a very strong moral character, and she made a commitment for better or worse,' said Tahari. 'She never wanted Jordan to say to her, 'Why didn't you do everything you could to help Dad?' Despite her moral conviction to stay, friends and family have said that since the news broke of Weiner's continued sexting habit, Abedin has been trying to hide her tears from her son. 'He is the light in her life, and that's what she was focused on. She needed to pull herself together,' said one friend to People magazine. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (R) receives a note from her aide Huma Abedin (L) as she testifies about the State Department's 2012 budget during a hearing of the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Subcommittee And, since it became clear she is not going to walk away from her marriage, Abedin has become distraught at the second guessing of her decision by friends - including the Clintons. 'No one wants to see Huma go through this,' said a source close to the Clintons. 'They are done with him. As part of caring about Huma, neither would shed a tear if he left the race and went away.' Despite the public disapproval for remaining with Weiner, Abedin has vowed to continued to campaign by his side. Seemingly stuck between a rock and a hard place, Abedin is acutely aware that if she appears too forgiving it will add to her husband's problems, but if she disappears altogether, it will look worse. 'Every day that she alluded to his problems and said he's a better man and it's in the past, she was taking it too far,' a friend said. 'She knows that.' 'What worries me about her is this feeling that she has to be what everyone thinks she is. Some steely superhuman.'"

The millionaire donor is said to have routinely flown out of Luton airport in the evening so he could sleep on his jet. Because he was outside British jurisdiction at night, this allowed him to extend the number of days he could stay in the UK without paying tax. Jet dodge: The millionaire donor is said to have routinely flown out of Luton airport so he could extend the number of days he could stay in the UK without paying tax As a non-resident, he could spend just 91 full days in the country each year. The arrangement was revealed by Sarah Southern, the lobbyist at the centre of the recent cash-for-Cameron scandal. The former aide to the Prime Minister made her comments during a dinner with undercover reporters in Zurich earlier this year. The identity of the donor, who would often skip out of the country overnight to avoid tax, is not known. Ms Southern said: 'I love that 90-day thing... because it's a full day. 'I know someone who will sometimes get on his jet and fly out and fly back in after midnight. So he's not been there for a whole day.' She said the donor was so rich that it was worth his while making flights to nowhere to avoid an enormous tax bill. Whistleblower: The arrangement was revealed by Sarah Southern, the lobbyist at the centre of the recent cash-for-Cameron scandal The lobbyist said that with a fortune like his, 'you can sleep on your jet three times a week. You can do whatever you want. The world literally is your oyster.' She said a helicopter took the donor to Luton airport where he stepped onto his jet and retired for the night in an onboard bedroom. Since 2008, the tax authorities' 'midnight rule' has applied to anyone who is still in the UK on midnight of the 91st day. Before 2010, days travelling in and out of the country were not counted under the 91-day rule. The donor could therefore have saved two days off his entitlement with each overnight trip. The guidelines were changed by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to include the days that a non-resident is in the country at midnight, even if they have just travelled into Britain that day. Ms Southern told the reporters that she believed the donor's tax arrangements have since changed. Chancellor George Osborne has described aggressive tax avoiders as 'morally repugnant' and has warned tax cheats that the government 'will find you and your money'. The revelations come two weeks after Peter Cruddas, the former Tory party co-treasurer, was forced to resign after he was filmed selling meetings with the PM for £250,000. He told the undercover reporters how he himself had made a fortune by avoiding taxes on financial transactions. The spread-betting tycoon said his firm, CMC Markets, got around tax rules legally by classing transactions as 'bets' rather than conventional trades. He said: 'That's my claim to glory. If you bet on something in the UK you avoid capital gains tax and stamp duty.'"

Special Agent James ""Terry"" Watson, assigned to the DEA unit in Cartagena, was on temporary duty in Bogota. Watson died after being stabbed in a taxi cab Thursday night after leaving a Bogota restaurant, a law enforcement official said. Investigators believe Watson's cab stopped at a traffic light and his assailants jumped out of two other cabs which pulled up on either side of the vehicle in which he was riding, the official said. The official said taxi vehicle robberies are part of what are called ""millionaire ride"" thefts. There's no suggestion the suspected robbers knew they had set upon a DEA agent. According to the official, Watson managed to escape from the cab and was taken to a hospital, where he died. Patrick Ventrell, a State Department spokesman, said earlier Thursday evening Watson watched the last game of the NBA finals at a restaurant with colleagues from the U.S. Embassy. The United States is working in close cooperation with Colombian authorities to find those responsible, Ventrell said. ""This is really a profound tragedy for our embassy community and indeed for our government."" ""These are the worst days for anyone in law enforcement and we grieve Terry's loss,"" said DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. The DEA said Watson was a 13-year veteran of the agency.

The whale could not be moved on Thursday because the National Park equipment that would ordinarily be used was ""destroyed by Hurricane Sandy,"" said NOAA spokeswoman Allison McHale. The plan now is to transport the carcass on Friday with the joint effort of the National Park Service and New York City Sanitation. Both agencies have reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers, which has the type of heavy equipment that needed, according to McHale. The National Park Service has agreed to let the whale be buried on the beach where it is currently located, up in the sand dunes where the high water line will prevent erosion, McHale said. ""The necropsy will then be conducted either tomorrow or Saturday,"" McHale said, ""depending on when the whale is moved."" The whale was first discovered Wednesday morning on a beach in Breezy Point, a community still reeling from Superstorm Sandy, and biologists had been closely monitoring the status of the whale since its discovery. ""What we will do next is determine where the animal will remain, if we are able to bury it on the beach, or if it will need to be moved,"" Rob Digiovanni, executive director and senior biologist for the Riverhead Foundation, a Long Island-based marine research and preservation group, said earlier Thursday. ""That would be a discussion we need to have when we get there. Our plan is to do a necropsy on the beach to find out why it died."" Disposal of the carcass remained a challenge. ""In the past they (have) been buried on the beach, disposed of in a landfill, or towed out to sea,"" said McHale. Late Wednesday, the whale was still alive but it was ""emaciated and in poor physical condition so there is nothing that can be done to save the whale,"" she said then.

Paul Fisher, a Stanford University pediatric neurologist, told a California judge Monday that he sees no evidence that Jahi McMath is alive 10 months after a coroner signed her death certificate. Jahi was declared brain dead on Dec. 12 after she went into cardiac arrest following surgery to treat sleep apnea. Fisher dismissed videos showing the girl moving her hands and feet at her mother's command. Her family wants Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo to issue what would be an unprecedented order declaring her to be alive after being declared brain dead. A hearing had been scheduled for Thursday, but it has been postponed as the attorney representing McMath's mother seeks time to respond to Fisher's finding. 'There wasn't time to react to this letter,' attorney Chris Dolan said Wednesday night. 'Given the fact that we were up against the time crunch ... I thought that we were going to be in essence sandbagged.' Dolan objected to Fisher's appointment as an independent expert, arguing that the doctor has a conflict of interest because he was one of the physicians who agreed with the brain-death diagnosis in December. Thursday's hearing wasn't immediately rescheduled, and Dolan has asked for a four-week delay so his experts and Fisher can discuss the results and come up with a plan for more tests that would satisfy them all. Scroll down for video No evidence: Paul Fisher, a Stanford University pediatric neurologist, told a California judge Monday that he sees no evidence that Jahi McMath is alive 10 months after a coroner signed her death certificate 'I just wanted to give these doctors a chance to talk,' Dolan said. Five other medical professionals who performed new tests on the teenager in New Jersey last month said the girl showed signs of brain function. In his letter to the judge, Fisher replied that the tests either were irrelevant to determining brain death in a child or not carried out in accordance with accepted medical standards. 'None of the declarations provide evidence that Jahi McMath is not brain dead,' he wrote. Jahi has been kept on a ventilator and feeding tubes since she suffered severe complications from the surgery. Fisher examined her then at the request of the judge while her family fought a hospital's decision to remove the equipment. Fisher was one of three doctors who declared her brain-dead after finding no neurological activity. Mother: Jahi's mother, Latasha Winkfield, has worked to keep her daughter's organs functioning on life support, first at Children's Hospital in Oakland and later at an undisclosed medical facility, and now a house in New Jersey Dismissed: Fisher dismissed videos showing the girl moving her hands and feet at her mother's command Dolan has given the judge the results of a Sept. 1 electroencephalogram that a researcher at a medical school in Cuba said showed electrical activity in Jahi's brain. Fisher, in his letter to the judge, said the new test was performed in an apartment, not a health care setting, and the recorded activity could have come from elsewhere in the girl's body or even the environment. Regardless, he said, a flat reading on the exam is not a prerequisite for brain death. Fisher similarly took issue with the brain scan that allegedly showed blood flowing to Jahi's brain. He said the test doctors and researchers from the nonprofit International Brain Research Foundation used was incorrect and would not have demonstrated such blood flow. Tests: Five medical professionals who performed new tests on the teenager in New Jersey last month said the girl showed signs of brain function Jahi's mother, Latasha Winkfield, has worked to keep her daughter's organs functioning on life support, first at Children's Hospital in Oakland and later at an undisclosed medical facility, and now a house in New Jersey.

Scientists say citalopram can significantly reduce the formation of plaques in the brain, which could go some way to warding off the disease. The U.S. academics admit it is too early to recommend the drug to Alzheimer’s patients, but dementia charities last night welcomed the ‘promising’ findings as providing ‘vital new clues’ about the disease. Plaque deposits are closely associated with declining memory and other symptoms of Alzheimer’s, so anything that can stop their build-up in the brain is likely to help ward off the condition. The research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, found that a single dose of the antidepressant citalopram lowered production of the plaque protein amyloid beta by 37 per cent. The experiment was conducted in healthy adults aged 18 to 50, but the scientists, from the universities of Washington and Pennsylvania, hope the findings can be replicated in elderly patients. The drug, marketed in the UK as Cipramil, also had a dramatic effect on elderly mice, halting the growth of existing plaques and reducing the formation of new deposits by 78 per cent. Lead scientist Dr John Cirrito, from Washington University School of Medicine said: ‘Antidepressants appear to be significantly reducing amyloid beta production, and that’s exciting. 'But while antidepressants generally are well tolerated, they have risks and side effects. ‘Until we can more definitively prove that these drugs help slow or stop Alzheimer’s in humans, the risks aren’t worth it. There is still much more work to do.’ The amyloid beta protein is a waste product of normal brain activity. But its levels rise in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients, causing it to clump together in plaques. Earlier research by Dr Cirrito’s team showed that serotonin, a brain messenger chemical, reduces amyloid beta production. Serotonin is also linked to mood, and many antidepressants work by keeping the neurotransmitter circulating in the brain Serotonin is also linked to mood, and many antidepressants work by keeping the neurotransmitter circulating in the brain. The scientists are now investigating how serotonin affects amyloid beta production in mice at the molecular level. Co-author Dr Yvette Sheline, from the University of Pennsylvania, said: ‘We also plan to study older adults who will be treated for two weeks with antidepressants. ‘If we see a drop in levels of amyloid beta in their spinal fluid after two weeks, then we will know that this beneficial reduction in amyloid beta is sustainable.’ Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘Amyloid build-up occurs many years before symptoms appear in Alzheimer’s, and understanding how to prevent or delay its accumulation early is a key goal for Alzheimer’s researchers. ‘This study has yielded some interesting findings, and further research to understand the mechanisms responsible for these results could provide vital new clues about the disease and how to fight it. ‘Currently half a million people in the UK are living with Alzheimer’s, the most common cause of dementia, and we urgently need treatments that can stop the disease in its tracks. 'Investment in research is crucial if we are to develop these treatments and provide better outcomes for people with the disease.’ Dr Doug Brown, director of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, added: ‘The fact that this anti-depressant has the ability to reduce the production of amyloid beta is promising, and it is encouraging to see the effects in mice replicated in people. ‘However, this was a small study in healthy people, so more research is needed to see if the drug could work for people with dementia, or even help prevent the condition developing in the first place.’ Citalopram is one of the most-commonly prescribed antidepressants in England, where 53million prescriptions of all antidepressants are issued a year, double the number prescribed a decade ago. According to recent research, one in three British women and one in 10 men now take antidepressants, and doctors have been warned not to routinely prescribe the drugs. While citalopram is not clinically addictive, some experts fear that people who take it as an antidepressant can become dependent on it."

Did U.S. intelligence officials even know the meeting was taking place? ""I can't imagine that they knew about this meeting. After all, there have been seven drone attacks in Yemen this year. There was one on April 1, so it's not like the drone program is being suspended,"" Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst, told ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.""

Analysts are looking at a flashy white truck that appears, leading a convoy. They are even analyzing the fruit juice being served as a possible clue. In the middle of the clip, the man known as al Qaeda's crown prince, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, appears brazenly out in the open, greeting followers in Yemen. Al-Wuhayshi is the No. 2 leader of al Qaeda globally and the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In a speech to the group, al-Wuhayshi makes it clear that he's going after the United States, saying ""We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!"" The video started appearing on jihadist websites recently, drawing the attention of U.S. officials and global terrorism experts. U.S. officials say they believe it's authentic. They believe the highly produced video is recent. With some fighters' faces blurred, there is worry it signals a new round of plotting. Asked by Blitzer why al Qaeda would release such a video, Bergen speculated that the group did it for propaganda purposes. ""To show we're here. We're still in operation,"" he said. ""This group is still potentially a pretty virulent threat, unfortunately."" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, is considered the most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate. The CIA and the Pentagon have killed multiple AQAP leaders with drone strikes. But the group is now emboldened. Retired Gen. Mark Kimmitt said smaller al Qaeda affiliates are coalescing into a more organized base. ""Sooner or later, if they continue to get better, stronger and more organized,"" he said, ""they will be a direct threat to the United States."" It's unlikely the United States wasn't aware of the meeting shown in the video, Kimmitt told ""CNN Tonight."" ""The question isn't why didn't we know,"" he said.

Kristin Davis was arrested after she was caught on tape exchanging the pills for Ecstasy and cash as the drug dealer was wearing a wire and working with federal authorities. Prosecutors made the accusation against Davis while announcing her arrest on charges of distributing and possessing a controlled substance. Day in court: Kristin Davis is escorted by media while she leaves the Manhattan Federal Court in New York on Tuesday Bitter pill: In the latest twist to a scandal-hit city campaign season, officials announced the arrest of 38-year-old Kristin Davis, seen here leaving court today Charged: Kristin Davis leaves the Manhattan Federal Court in New York after being arrested and charged with selling prescription pills for cash Arrested: Former madam Kristin Davis, seen here in 2009, was arrested for distributing and possessing a controlled substance Davis, 38, was to appear in court later Tuesday. Her attorney, Daniel Hochheiser, declined comment. The long-shot Libertarian candidate, who has a previous conviction for promoting prostitution, has made news by claiming to have gotten call girls for Spitzer before a prostitution scandal forced him from office. Her alleged connection to the Spitzer, who resigned from office in 2008 after his trysts with prostitutes were exposed, has never been proven. Davis got into the comptroller race before Spitzer, running on a platform to legalize and tax marijuana as a way to close potential city budget gaps. Other candidates include Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, also a Democrat, and Republican John Burnett, a former Wall Street executive. According to a criminal complaint, Davis began buying Xanax, Adderall and Ecstasy from the unidentified drug dealer in 2009. She allegedly told the dealer that 'she provided these drugs to others at house parties,' the complaint says. Political venture: Davis has trailed Spitzer politically ever since he was exposed to have used prostitutes, and she was jailed for promoting prostitution. She ran in the New York gubernatorial race in 2010 (pictured), a move many thought was to keep his transgressions in the press, and now is running against him for Comptroller In 2011, Davis asked the dealer if he would accept Adderall in exchange for Ecstasy, the complaint says, and they then traded 240 Adderall pills for 120 Ecstasy tablets. Authorities arrested the dealer in December and he agreed as part of guilty plea to record his conversations with Davis, the complaint says. In a recorded meeting on January 7, the cooperator paid Davis $675 in cash for 215 pills, it says. 'Ok, and this one is Ambien. There are 30 of those,' Davis allegedly said on tape. Running mates: It has never been proven that Davis was the madam that Spitzer contacted, but she continues to allege that she was Authorities also alleged that in April, Davis brokered a deal for another person to sell 180 oxycodone pills to the cooperator. The complaint references a video that shows Davis bringing the person to the dealer's apartment, where the dealer used $3,600 provided by the FBI to make the purchase.

On Monday morning, before the bodies were found, authorities said searchers and police dogs were being dispatched to the rugged, snowy area, and crews would dig into any sites where searchers thought they might find any of the missing men. The snowmobilers resided in Sparwood, a small town just north of Fernie. Sparwood's mayor, David Wilks, said Monday morning that ""it certainly doesn't look good"" for the missing. ""Reality tells us if you're stuck in the snow for about 24 hours, bad things can happen,"" he said. The region has had previous coal mine disasters, ""but in recent memory, this is the largest single tragic event to hit this community,"" Wilks said. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video He said the snowmobilers are men in their mid- to late 20s and described them as upstanding citizens, most of them working in coal mines or as businessmen. ""All were well aware of the dangers involved in snowmobiling. All are very cautious with what was going on,"" Wilks said. The mayor said temperatures had been as low as minus-30 degrees Fahrenheit in recent weeks, but the air had warmed up in the last two or three days to 25 degrees Fahrenheit.

But eco-friendly Prince Charles has prompted the design of a purse and planet-friendly kitchen 'for the people', that is specifically designed not to 'cost the earth.' The design of the new, lower-priced British Standard range of cupboards came about after Charles, well known for his environmental campaigns, was impressed with the kitchen in the model home built by Plain English for the The Prince's Foundation for Building Community. A kitchen fit for royalty: Plain English have created eco-friendly kitchen designs The Prince was first impressed with the kitchen design in a model house at the Ideal Home show in 2011 Charles was shown around the two-story Prince's House at the Ideal Home show by television property expert Kirstie Allsopp Prince Charles, who toured the environmentally-friendly model home at the 2011 Ideal Home show, was apparently particularly impressed with the craftsmanship in the kitchen, Remodelista reports. His remarks led Plain English to consider finding a way to bring the 'green' designs to a mass market. The company set about designing a more affordable range of cupboards, which have now gone on sale online. The British Standard cabinets are built in the same workshop in Suffolk as Plain English's higher priced kitchens. But while Plain English is a bespoke company offering a full design and fitting service, customers must collect and install the British Standard cabinets themselves. 'The British Standard Kitchen' by British Standard Cupboards aims to bring high quality long lasting kitchens that are affordable The British Standard cabinets are built in the same workshop in Suffolk as Plain English's higher priced kitchens, but customers must collect and install the cabinets themselves Worktops are available in three colours, iroko, oak, or sycamore wood, to give your kitchen an elegant royal makeover, and the range contains floor, tall and wall cabinets, which come in egg shell for you to paint the colour of your choice. An entire kitchen costs about £5,000 while an individual single floor cupboard costs £400. This might not seem particularly cheap, but the kitchen displayed in the original model home or 'Natural House' showcased at the Ideal Home Show in 2011 would have cost around £35,000 to have installed. Katie Fontana, Creative Director of Plain English and British Standard says: 'We wanted to celebrate 20 years of Plain English by taking a lead from His Royal Highness, Prince Charles: going back to basics and making cupboards that ordinary people can afford - 'sensible cupboards at sensible prices'. 'We are also paying tribute to the British craftsmen of the past whose honest, unfussy but eminently practical designs provided the original inspiration for Plain English all those years ago.' Inside, the house contained cushions made from old T-shirts and re-upholstered chairs made from recycled linen, as well as vintage furniture It is a re-creation of the 'natural house', a new home design currently being pioneered by the educational charity at the Building Research Establishment in Watford. The house is a traditionally built low carbon home made from natural materials. Inside the exhibition hall, Charles was shown around the two-storey Prince's House by television property experts and ambassadors for the charity Kirstie Allsopp and George Clarke. The Prince appeared particularly taken with the crockery featuring dogs, exclaiming 'I love that', and also the red dinner place mats made from old fire hoses Inside, the house contained cushions made from old T-shirts and re-upholstered chairs made from recycled linen, as well as vintage furniture. After their tour, Ms Allsopp spoke about the Prince's interest in the project. She said: 'He'd seen the blueprint. It was the first time he'd seen it in 3-D as it were, but was very aware of what was going on the whole way through and he'd been to Watford to see the prototype of the house. 'He loved it. What he particularly liked was all the different re-upholstered items and reuse of fabric. He was very impressed by the fact you could take something made for a different purpose and make it domestically useful.' She added: 'It's what the Prince has been so passionate about for so long and yet it is at the moment enormously fashionable.'"

Gebrselassie is one of the most celebrated track and field athletes of all time, dominating the 10,000 meter event by winning four consecutive World Championships titles over the distance between 1993 and 1999. Now he hopes to use his iconic status in his homeland to kick start his political career, a move he has long been expected to make. ""A lot of messages in the news about me going into politics,"" the 40-year-old, who clinched gold in 1996 and 2000, said on Twitter. ""Yes, I want to be in the parliament in 2015 to help my country to move forward."" If Gebrselassie does successfully make the transition into politics, he will be following in the footsteps of some other sport stars. Gebrselassie's fellow two-time gold medal winner Sebastian Coe served as a Member of Parliament in his native Britain between 1992 and 1997. Former middle distance runner Coe also served as chairman of the organizing committee's for last year's London 2012 Olympic Games. Manny Pacquiao, boxing's first and only eight-division world champion, has become a political heavyweight in the Philippines. The 34-year-old, known as the ""Pac Man"", was elected into the House of Representatives for the Sarangani province in May 2010. A host of famous football names have also forged successful political careers for themselves. Romario was a lethal striker who starred as Brazil won the World Cup in 1994. He is now an elected member of the Chamber of Deputies on the Brazilian Socialist Party ticket and has recently expressed concerns regarding the South American country's hosting of the 2014 World Cup. Romario has raised the issue of whether the money spent hosting football's biggest competition would be better spent on education. Like Romario, George Weah was once voted FIFA World Player of the Year. The Liberian striker, who received the accolade in 1995, ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of his country in 2005 despite gaining over 40% of the vote."

Aliyah Weekes, 19, instigated a sex attack carried out by her younger brother in an alleyway on the 15-year-old victim, who she accused of spreading rumours. She was sentenced to four-and-a-half years' detention in a young offenders institute today for her role in what a judge called a 'truly wicked' crime. Her 18-year-old brother Lacquan Weekes, who carried out the attack, was detained for five years at the Old Bailey after he was found guilty of rape following a trial. Aliyah Weekes (left) forced a 15-year-old girl to perform a sex act on her brother, Lacquan (right), as part of a 'revenge rape' after she claimed the victim 'spread stories' about her Aliyah Weekes and a 16-year-old girl were also convicted of aiding and abetting the attack. The youngest defendant was spared a custodial sentence and given a youth rehabilitation order for 18 months. Sentencing the trio, Judge Jeremy Donne said: 'This was no game. This was no childish folly. This was a wicked crime and one that Aliyah Weekes, you determined upon over the space of about an hour during which the victim was detained.' The sex attack happened after the victim confronted by the two girls in a park in Willesden, north-west London in April. The victim was forced into an alleyway and made to perform a sex act on Lacquan Weekes, while a group of youths watched nearby. Judge Donne said: 'This was a revenge rape and this poor girl was being punished. She was accused of spreading stories. Her explanations were rejected. 'She was very distressed throughout this. She must have been terrified. To compound her fear was the added humiliation that all of this was happening before a group of other youths who were nearby. This was a truly wicked offence.' The judge said he held Aliyah Weekes 'principally responsible' for the incident, which he said would not have happened without her involvement. She had told the victim 'snitches get stitches' when she accused the victim of telling secrets about her and the 16-year-old. The victim was also threatened with being put through an even more horrific ordeal. The judge said  Aliyah Weekes was 'principally responsible' and the court heard Lacquan Weekes poses a 'high risk to the public In an impact statement, the victim's mother said she had changed from a 'bubbly and carefree' girl to being 'jumpy and withdrawn' with a 'lack of confidence and trust in people'. Her family had also been targeted in 'acts of intimidation' including having a brick thrown through their window, the court heard. Lacquan Weekes, of north-west London, smiled and chatted to his sister in the dock as the court heard that he poses a 'high risk' to the public. The judge said Lacquan Weekes, who has previous convictions for battery and possession of drugs, had shown 'not one iota of remorse' for the crime and said his behaviour while on remand had been 'appalling'. Paul Stanislas, for Aliyah Weekes, also from north-west London, said she had played 'no more' than an 'instigator role' in the attack. Michael Chambers, for her brother, said he had a 'very troubled background'. Clare Gordon, representing the youngest defendant, said she neither 'perpetrated nor instigated' the incident. The confrontation happened on a patch of grass outside the College of North West London campus in Willesden, north-west London (pictured) before the girl was led to an alley. File photo"

He says they called him a ""terrorist"" and ""Osama."" His response: ""If I could speak to my attackers,"" he said, ""I would ask them if they had any questions, if they knew what they were doing. Maybe invite them to the gurdwara where we worship, get to know who we are."" Most people would be surprised by Dr. Singh's willingness to forgive and constructively engage his attackers. I am not. Like most Sikhs, I was taught at a young age about Bhai Ghaniya, a famous Sikh who would distribute food and water to wounded enemy soldiers. The lesson instilled was that the work of mending fences begins as soon as one can no longer harm you. As a professional advocate working with Sikh hate crime victims for more than a decade since 9/11, I have consistently seen Sikhs move beyond the punitive bent of our criminal justice system and adopt a Sikh approach to addressing our attackers. The result is a decidedly Sikh-American brand of justice that produces more social benefit than the revolving-door criminal justice system in our country. Take our work with Gurpreet Singh and Thomas Brand. Thomas worked at Marsh McLenan at the World Trade Center. He never had a chance to say goodbye to his colleagues who died there on 9/11. Traveling on trains made him scared and angry. He acted on his anger a year later by pushing Gurpreet on the Long Island Railroad, urging him to leave the train and calling him a ""terrorist."" Thomas was stopped by an off-duty police officer, arrested, and eventually prosecuted. When it came time for sentencing, the prosecutor was ready to recommend jail time for Thomas. Gurpreet did not want that to happen. He saw a man in real pain who needed a lift up and not jail time. He asked that the prosecutor recommend Thomas engage in community service aimed at combating hate in a post 9/11 world. Thomas was very nervous when he came to our office. He said he knew nothing about us and always thought we were ""stern"" and ""angry."" He said he was surprised that one of my colleagues was wearing shorts instead of pants. We got to know each other and eventually Thomas was standing with Gurpreet and me as we went to gurdwaras, Sikh houses of worship, collecting reports of bias against Sikhs. All of us were better for the experience. Gurpreet and I had our own prejudices and fears of people who looked like ""Joe America"" and clearly Thomas had his own perceptions about us ""turban folk"" as well. Rather than allow him to spend time incarcerated in the overworked criminal justice system, we all found healing and became better people for it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amardeep Singh."

He swims among sharks without the protection of a cage to make studio-quality, intimate photos of these beautiful creatures. As scary as that might sound, the top predators are at the bottom of his list of concerns. He's usually far more concerned about all the gear he brings into the water. ""The sharks don't really pose any of the danger. It's all the diving, and the technical [challenges] and electricity and the light,"" Muller says. ""I don't use cages -- I've been surrounded by 150 to 200 sharks, not once ever been close to being bitten."" Using studio techniques in the wild has helped Muller's work stand out in a crowded field of nature photographers. It bolsters the attention he's received as a commercial photographer, a spotlight he's leveraging to raise awareness about critically diminishing global shark populations. This week his shark photos are being featured on the Instagram blog as he takes over Discovery Channel's account for Shark Week. He'll be uploading images from his own feed as well as posting new pictures from Mexico, where he's currently swimming with whale sharks. Both venues are helping broadcast his pictures -- and his message -- to an enormous audience. Because of threats like overfishing and a high demand for fins, ""the sharks are really in a lot of danger right now,"" he says. ""We're killing about 100 million of them a year. People have no idea when they hear the numbers, and they're the top of a very, very fragile ecosystem in the oceans, so if you take out the top predator it's just like a domino effect."" ""White Mike"" as he's sometimes called, says his highly successful commercial work has helped him see the power of photography, but rather than promote celebrities or products, he's using his skills to help advocacy organizations like WildAid, Sea Shepherds, EarthEcho, and Shark Spotters in South Africa. ""I thought OK, I've done $10 billion in movie posters, maybe I can help sort of change people's perceptions of these animals and what's happening to our planet,"" he says. As any professional photographer must be these days, Muller is also something of an entrepreneur. In addition to owning the patent on the seven-bulb, 1200-watt lighting rig he uses to illuminate the sharks, he's developed a photo toning app and is busy helping establish an online photography school. He says he's also got a number of books in the works, based on his photos of sharks. Photographers strive to make images that connect with viewers, and the skills needed to do that are universal, whether under water or on land. A sense for composition, timing, and more than anything, patience will produce powerful images of a shark as surely as anything else. Muller hopes the connections his images forge will motivate people to think beyond their preconceptions about sharks. Ultimately, the global conversation will have to shift so people don't see these animals simply as a source of fins, or animals to be hunted for sport, but instead as the magnificent mainstays of a vast and delicate ecosystem that they really are. ""In order to get those changes you need people from within those cultures to come out and take a stand, which they're starting to do,"" he says. ""Our generation I don't really have a lot of hope for,"" he says. ""It's for the next generation [that needs to] fix what we've done and what we're leaving them.""

Robertson was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer just last week while being treated for pneumonia at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California, Susan Robertson said. He died Tuesday. ""He always said he lived two or three lifetimes,"" she said. ""He was in Hollywood when it was great."" People we've lost in 2013: The lives they lived Robertson's acting career began after a movie scout saw a photo of him in a Hollywood photo shop's display window. He had the portrait taken to send to his mother while he was stationed at an Army post in California, according to his official biography. He acted in several uncredited movie roles in 1948 after he left the Army, leading to his role as the outlaw Jesse James in ""Fighting Man of the Plains"" in 1949. Robertson starred in the TV Western series ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" from 1957 through 1962, riding a horse named Jubilee. During the last hours of his life, as he lay in a hospital bed, his wife comforted Robertson by whispering thoughts of what awaited him in the afterlife. ""I told him that Jubilee and Chief (his favorite dog) would be waiting to greet him,"" his wife told CNN. The role of a cowboy was not a stretch for Robertson, who grew up on an Oklahoma horse ranch. He and his wife raised horses in Oklahoma until moving to a San Diego suburb last summer, Susan Robertson said. Robertson never sought formal acting training, based on advice that he should keep his own personality, according to his biography. In the 1966 TV series ""Iron Horse,"" Robertson played a character who won a railway in a high-stakes poker game. He hosted, along with Ronald Reagan, episodes of ""Death Valley Days"" during the 1960s. Film roles, also mostly Westerns, included ""Devil's Canyon,"" ""Sitting Bull,"" and ""Dakota Incident."" In the 1980s, Robertson was a regular on the first season of ""Dynasty,"" and acted in episodes of ""The Love Boat,"" ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Dallas."" His last role came in two episodes of the TV series ""Harts of the West"" in 1993. The final 15 years of Robertson's life were spent in ill health, partly because of wounds suffered while serving in a tank crew in North Africa and Europe during World War II, his wife said. His wife called for an ambulance to take him to the hospital because of pain last week, she said. Doctors were treating him for pneumonia when tests revealed he had lung cancer that had spread to his brain, bones, liver and lymph nodes, she said."

The singer’s spokesman claimed she had created Tara Entertainment Ltd to deal with her international earnings simply because her accountant is Irish rather than as a way of paying a lower rate of company tax. Tara, which was set up in 2001, and its British-based parent company CC Entertainment International, were put into voluntary liquidation in the last two months, prompting speculation the star is keen to avoid accusations she is dodging UK tax. Cheryl Cole (in between Mel B and Simon Cowell) was introduced to the accountant Alan McEvoy by her former manager Louis Walsh (left) However last night Cole’s publicist Sundraj Sreenivasan insisted the change in her financial arrangements was because her accountant Alan McEvoy had moved to London. Mr Sreenivasan added that the star had been introduced to Mr McEvoy by Girls Aloud former manager Irish impresario Louis Walsh. In a statement he said: ‘Cheryl has used the same accountant in Ireland for 13 years. The accountant was recommended by Louis Walsh, who at the time managed her as part of Girls Aloud. Her accountant has recently set up an office in London so Cheryl’s Irish company has been dissolved.’ The change in Cole’s tax affairs came just days before George Michael, Gary Barlow and dozens of other celebrities learned they are liable for millions in unpaid taxes after HMRC ruled an investment vehicle they had used was a tax avoidance scam. While Cole’s actions are legal, the last accounts for Tara showed assets of £2.5 million at the end of 2012, suggesting the star had funnelled at least this much through the company. Girls Aloud: Sarah Harding, Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Cole and Kimberley Walsh If this was the case the singer would have avoided paying £200,000 in tax that would have been owed in Britain. This is the difference between Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate compared to the 21 per cent rate in the UK. Documents for the liquidation of the company, CC Entertainment – which in 2013 declared only £1 in net assets – now show it has £1.88 million funds, which is likely to be paid to Cole as the company’s sole owner. She has married her French lover Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, 33, after a whirlwind three-month romance."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and Jean Claude Juncker (right), the new president of the European Commission raise a glass in celebration The prominent British politician, who served as Minister for Europe, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘All the stories about Juncker’s drinking are true. I know because I had to work with him. He is a complete drunk. ‘I regarded it as pointless talking to him after 12 o’clock because at times he seemed incapable of working, so drunk you couldn’t get any sense out of him. It is every bit as bad as people say. I have seen him so p****d that he  was dribbling. Mr Juncker is said to have drunk one Campari, three glasses of wine and three Sambucas in an hour ‘Everyone in Brussels knows that Juncker drinks far too much. I would call him an alcoholic. Talk to European politicians in private and they will all tell you about his drink problem.’ The politician, who spoke  to The Mail on Sunday on condition of anonymity, said Mr Juncker’s drinking was not the only reason he was unfit to be EC President. ‘He is totally wrong for the job and isn’t any good. I was talking to a senior French politician only the other day and he agreed with me that Juncker is useless.’ Mr Juncker, 59, has been dogged by rumours of a drink problem for years. Summit tables were said  to have been awash with alcohol during his 20-year tenure as Prime Minister of Luxembourg. He resigned as a result of a spy scandal last year. The newspaper Letzebuerg Privat (Luxembourg Private), has referred to him as the country’s ‘drunken stupor premier’. Last year it ran a front-page report, accompanied by a photo of him guzzling drinks, in which it was alleged that he quaffed ‘a Campari, three glasses of wine and three Sambucas in only two hours’. German journal Der Spiegel said: ‘Juncker no longer cares what others think about him. ‘When he has to take a leak during a summit meeting, he says with a smirk he goes to the ladies’ room, because the men’s room  is too dirty for him. His image fluctuates between two extremes, Mr Euro and Mr Idiot.’ Despite being a member of the EU’s Centre-Right political grouping, Juncker has been called ‘the most socialist Christian Democrat there is’. He has also been accused of arrogance and admits being deceitful when it suits his political purposes. ‘When it becomes serious you have to lie,’ he said while handling the Eurozone crisis. Another German publication, Junge Welt, called him ‘a ruthless opportunist’ who had done more for the EU’s bankers than for its people. ‘Juncker is not a Democrat in the strict sense. He is a master of the back stairs,’ it said. Juncker’s own comments would appear to lend credibility to the claims. In 2011 he said: ‘Monetary policy is a serious issue. ‘We should discuss this in secret, in the Eurogroup. I am for secret, dark debates.’ He is a multi-millionaire through several bank and political jobs, has a £2m townhouse in Luxembourg city and a property in the country. He is married but does not have children. He is not the first EU President from his country to have a reputation for drinking. Jacques Santerre, the Luxembourg-born Commission President from 1995-1999, was known as ‘Jacques Sancerre’ due to his supposed fondness for fine French wines. Mr Juncker’s office refused  to comment."

Tango, a nine-year-old Labrador, was called to the witness stand to help determine who killed his owner. In a preliminary hearing, the suspect was ordered by the judge to threaten Tango with a bat, as jurors noted how the canine reacted. For comparison, a second dog of the same age and breed, Norman, was also called to the witness box in the French city of Tours to face the experiment. Gregoire Lafarge, defending, blasted the 'unreasonable' and 'dangerous' proceedings. He told RTL radio: 'So if Tango lifted his right paw, moved his mouth or his tail, is he recognising my client or not? 'I find it very troubling for the French legal system. 'If a judge ignores the demands of reason and surrounds himself with experts who are unreasonable, the system becomes very dangerous.' But it is hardly the first time a dog has been called to the stand. In 2008, a dog named Scooby created legal history as the first canine to appear as a witness in a murder case. The animal's 59-year-old owner had been found hanging from the ceiling of her Paris flat. Police believe it was suicide but her family say that it was murder. The dog was in the flat at the time of the death. During a preliminary hearing in the city, the pet was led into the witness box by a vet. A suspect in the case was presented to the dog, to see how it reacted. It is said to have 'barked furiously'. In 2012, a court in Charlotte County, Florida, took a similar approach by sending a subpoena to a German Shepherd in a drugs case. Not the first: In 2012, a German Shepherd was served a subpoena in Charlotte County, Florida The canine witnes was presented with suspects and drugs as vets responded to hit reaction And last month a vet was asked to analyse a Dalmatian's physical reactions as it sat in the witness box faced with two murder suspects. Dog behaviourist Jacques Cordel has blasted the activity as 'illegitimate'. He wrote in French magazine Nouvel Observateur: 'This expertise plays on popular beliefs, but has no scientific foundation. 'Ethology [animal behaviour study] is real science, it is no joke.'"

The removal of embattled Justice of the Peace Keith Bardwell lies with the Louisiana Supreme Court. But unseating a Louisiana justice of the peace isn't easy. Beth and Terence McKay -- who are now married -- stepped into the national spotlight when Keith Bardwell, a justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused them a license. Bardwell told Hammond's Daily Star last week that he was concerned for the children who might be born of the relationship and that, in his experience, most interracial marriages don't last. ""I'm not a racist,"" Bardwell told the newspaper. ""I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house. My main concern is for the children."" Despite a national uproar and a call by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal for him to lose his license, Bardwell, 56, said he has no regrets. ""It's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you haven't done wrong,"" he told CNN affiliate WAFB on Saturday. A state statute says justices of the peace may perform marriage ceremonies, but it does not require such officials to do so, Tammi Arender, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana attorney general, told CNN on Monday. To push for Bardwell's removal, the McKays must look to the Louisiana Supreme Court. Justices of the peace in Louisiana are elected, but the state's high court has jurisdiction over whether they can keep their jobs, Louisiana Supreme Court spokeswoman Valerie Willard said. The Judiciary Commission, a judicial body independent of the Supreme Court, has the power to review a case and make recommendations to the high court. After receiving a complaint, the Judiciary Commission would determine whether the grievance was frivolous. Anyone can file a complaint; no attorney is needed, Willard said, though Beth McKay said she has retained one. The commission would proceed with an investigation if there were allegations of ethical misconduct, or arguments that the justice of the peace was in violation of professional responsibility, Willard said. An investigation could take months or even a year, Willard said. And with closed-door hearings and records of investigations kept confidential, it's hard to tell how long the average investigation lasts. A lawyer from the Office of the Special Counsel, a branch of the commission, would prosecute the elected official, who would have an opportunity to defend himself. During the investigation, if the prosecutor could show the official was hindering the fair and due implementation of his job, the commission could suggest that the Louisiana Supreme Court enact a temporary suspension with pay. Barring such an incident, the justice of the peace could continue to oversee cases throughout the commission's confidential investigation. If the nine-member commission, by majority decision, decided the official acted unethically, it would recommend sanctions to the court. Those recommendations and the commission's findings would be public. Willard could not say whether Bardwell would be brought to the commission or what its decision would be. ""It's up to the judges to interpret the law,"" she said. If Bardwell were brought before the commission and it decided against him, recommended sanctions could include a public censure, suspension with or without pay, or removal. The court, after reviewing the commission's findings, could follow the commission's suggestions or opt for stronger or weaker sanctions. Or the seven-member court could decide the justice of the peace did not behave unethically, which would allow him to keep his job, Willard said."

'It is quite clear from their detailed examination of statements made by the board regarding Ibrox that, whilst giving the impression to fans and shareholders that they were making a commitment not to grant security over Ibrox, the board was in fact meticulously careful not to stray into language which would actually give such a legal commitment. 'We believe the effect of those statements was to be deliberately misleading. 'We have however been advised of various possible remedies, including those against individual directors, which may be available to us should the board actually go ahead and grant the security. We will continue to monitor this very, very closely. 'We are extremely angry that we are in a position where we are having to explore legal remedies in order to try to stop Rangers directors from acting in their own interests and those of Mr Ashley, rather than the shareholders and fans of Rangers.

In a letter to be read from 2,500 pulpits during mass this Sunday, the Archbishop of Westminster will warn that David Cameron’s pledge to legalise homosexual marriage would threaten the true meaning of a sacred union. In a significant intervention in the gay marriage debate, the Most Reverend Vincent Nichols will urge the country’s five million Roman Catholics to sign petitions and lobby their MPs about the changes. Controversy: The letter by Reverend Nichols (left) argues marriage between a man and a woman is at the 'foundation of our society'. Lord Carey (right) said no one had the right to redefine the institution The letter warns that plans to extend marriage to same-sex couples would be a ‘profoundly radical step’ that reduces it to a vague commitment between two people. The letter says the roots of marriage lie in human nature and the pattern of complementarity and fertility in the union are affirmed by many other religious traditions. It argues that matrimony is an expression of 'our fundamental humanity' and says: 'Neither the Church nor the State has the power to change this fundamental understanding of marriage itself.' It continues: 'Its status in law is the prudent fruit of experience, for the good of the spouses and the good of the family. 'In this way, society esteems the married couple as the source and guardians of the next generation. As an institution marriage is at the foundation of our society.' The text, which is co-signed by the RC Archbishop of Southwark, the Most Reverend Peter Smith, argues that marriage between a man and a woman is at the ‘foundation of our society’. In an article for the Daily Mail last month, Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote: ‘Marriage precedes both the state and the church, and neither of these institutions have the right to redefine it in such a fundamental way.’ Backing: The Prime Minister is a strong supporter of plans to legalise same-sex marriage The last time the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church used a pastoral letter to intervene on a political issue, during attempts to inflict quotas on faith schools in 2007, the government climbed down within days. The letter is expected to have a more moderate tone than comments made at the weekend by Keith O’Brien, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, who described gay marriage proposals as grotesque. Cardinal O’Brien insisted that the reforms would shame the United Kingdom in the eyes of the world. He said: ‘Since all the legal rights of marriage are already available to homosexual couples, it is clear this proposal is not about rights but rather is an attempt to redefine marriage at the behest of a small minority of activists. ‘If marriage can be redefined so that it no longer means a man and a woman but two men or two women, why stop there? Why not allow three men, or a woman and two men, to constitute a marriage, if they pledge their fidelity to one another?’ The Prime Minister is a strong supporter of plans to legalise same-sex marriage, which are also supported by the Lib Dems, and are set to be formally unveiled later this month. But the proposal has divided the Conservative Party and put Mr Cameron on a collision course with religious leaders. Prime Minister David Cameron’s official spokesman said: 'The Government has made clear its commitment to equality. 'We believe people should have the option of civil marriage, irrespective of sexual orientation.' He also said that the timing of the consultation had been chosen to allow legislation to be taken through Parliament before the general election planned for 2015. But he declined to speculate on the timetable for any Bill, telling reporters: 'We normally set out the timetable for legislation at the time of the Queen’s Speech and we do it session by session. 'We have purposefully set up this consultation with a timetable that would allow us to have that legislation in this Parliament.' Reverend Vincent Nichols' letters warns that plans to extend marriage to same-sex couples would be a 'profoundly radical step' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told ITV’s The Agenda: 'I think marriage is defined surely by two people who love each other and want to make a commitment to each other. 'Depriving same-sex couples of that public display in this day and age, I think most people think ""Come on, let’s move with the times"".' Civil partnerships were introduced for gay couples in 2005 but by law they cannot be referred to as marriages. The clergymen are the latest to denounce the Government’s backing for marriage to include gay couples. In January, the Anglican Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, insisted governments did not have the moral authority to redefine marriage. If the law is changed, Britain will become the seventh European country to recognise same-sex marriage, after the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Norway. The Catholic archbishops’ letter also appears to challenge Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone’s remarks last week that the church does not ‘own’ marriage and that the state was entitled to make changes to the institution. ‘The reasons given by our Government for wanting to change the definition of marriage are those of equality and discrimination,’ the letter says. ‘But our present law does not discriminate unjustly when it requires both a man and a woman for marriage. It simply recognises and protects the distinctive nature of marriage. ‘Changing the legal definition of marriage would be a profoundly radical step. Its consequences should be taken seriously now. ‘There would be no recognition of the complementarity of male and female or that marriage is intended for the procreation and education of children. ‘The roots of the institution of marriage lie in our nature. This pattern is affirmed by many other religious traditions – understood as a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman.’"

Sir Edward Garnier, the former solicitor general, said the costs of a recent case involving David Cameron’s local hunt were far too high. And he called for the charity’s cases to be taken over by the Crown Prosecution Service. MPs clashed over the the Heythrop hunt, which Prime Minister David Cameron has ridden with, after it was the subject of a £327,000 private prosecution by the RSPCA The RSPCA prosecuted the Heythrop hunt in Oxfordshire last year at a cost of £327,000 following covert filming. The hunt was fined £4,000 after admitting four offences. Although two of its members pleaded guilty and were fined, their supporters claimed the case was politically motivated to target the Prime Minister. ‘If they continue to prosecute at such huge expense in such a disproportionate way, they will be open to public criticism... by the judge, as they were, or by MPs, or by ordinary members of the public,’ Sir Edward said. Speaking at a Westminster debate, he said the CPS would be more dispassionate. He added: ‘This is not to say the RSPCA should not investigate, but it needs to be careful that it does not move away from being an animal welfare organisation and become a political campaigner, using the state prosecuting system as a weapon.’ The well-attended debate was triggered by Tory MP Simon Hart, a former head of the Countryside Alliance. Former solicitor general Sir Edward Garnier warned the RSPCA would face more 'public criticism' if it pursued cases against hunts He claims that the charity is pursing an ‘aggressive political agenda’ against pet owners which is ‘at odds with animal welfare’. Pointedly avoiding the subject of hunting, Mr Hart called for ‘absolute clarity and accountability’ about the charity’s role as a prosecutor. He said it pursued only ‘tantalising’ cases and that some defendants pleaded guilty because they feared crippling legal costs. But Dominic Grieve, speaking for the Government, told MPs the charity had the right to bring private prosecutions and that it performed a ‘valuable role’ bringing cruelty cases which might otherwise go unprosecuted. The Attorney General said the Crown Prosecution Service had the power to take over RSPCA cases, or stop them if they do not meet standards for evidence or public interest. Mr Grieve said this had happened in only four of the thousands of cases the charity has brought. The RSPCA says it spends £5million a year prosecuting cruelty cases, which it insists accounts for just 5p in every pound donated. It said the prosecutions department was independent of its campaigning work and that it had a 98 per cent success rate in cases. Mr Hart, MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, said the RSPCA was ‘not an arm of the law’ and claimed its relationship with police in offering to investigate such cases was ‘deeply troubling and part of the problem’. But Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, accused Mr Hart of representing the ‘hunting lobby’ and trying to help ‘rich, powerful Tories’ break the law. Cheryl Gillan, until recently Mr Cameron’s Welsh Secretary, praised a £2.3million prosecution that the RSPCA brought in her Buckinghamshire constituency."

The 18-year-old jetted into the Portuguese capital on Tuesday with his agent, John Colquhoun, his dad and the United secretary John Taylor to finalise his dream switch to the Primeira Liga runners-up. Gauld was undergoing a medical late on Tuesday night after agreeing personal terms on a contract that would run until 2020, as Sporting aimed to rush through the deal in time for their celebrations to mark the club’s 108th anniversary. On the move: Ryan Gauld is on his way to Sporting Lisbon And, despite a few legal formalities still to be tied up, senior sources close to the move confirmed to Sportsmail that it was ‘essentially a done deal’. It represents a stunning move for Gauld who, at the end of his breakthrough campaign in Scottish football, will now find himself playing in the Champions League with Sporting Lisbon next season. The wide midfielder burst to prominence as a young and exciting United side finished fourth in last season’s Scottish Premiership and reached the Scottish Cup Final, only to lose 2-0 to St Johnstone. His form led to scouts from European powerhouses like Real Madrid, Roma, Manchester United and Arsenal beating a path to Tannadice to watch the talented teenager in the flesh. It also led United to shrewdly tie down their Scotland Under-21 star, who made 42 first-team appearances since his debut in 2012, by securing him on improved terms until 2016. His profile was also substantially raised by his team-mates nicknaming him ‘Baby Messi’, due to the similarity in style and build to Argentina and Barcelona star Lionel Messi. Twiner: Gauld takes on three Celtic players during the Scottish Cup semi-final in April Joy: He made 50 appearances for the club in all competitions scoring nine goals VIDEO Gauld scores a brace for Dundee United On Tuesday, United boss Jackie McNamara had spoken of his desire to keep Gauld at Tannadice to build on last season’s achievements. But he admitted the teenage midfielder’s departure from Tayside was inevitable after a ‘life-changing’ bid was received from the club that honed the talents of Real Madrid’s Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo. ‘There comes a time when a bid is too good to turn down, not just financially but for the player himself,’ said McNamara, speaking before the deal was tied up. ‘If it’s the right club, it could be life changing. ‘The initial offer was good enough for us to let Ryan go and speak to them. We’ ll just need to see what happens over the next 24 hours. ‘I wouldn’t be disappointed if he doesn’t go. Looking at it selfishly from a Dundee United point of view, we’d want him to stay and play for us next season. ‘But, professionally, having been a player myself, you always want people to get a good opportunity. So there are two sides to it. ‘We have said all along that we know the talent we have with Ryan and others. So we’ve known that one day people would come in for them. It was inevitable it would happen.’"

Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who often finds himself at odds with the White House, said spending $500 million to provide weapons to groups in Syria that are fighting both ISIS and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will backfire. ""At the end of the day, most of the arms that we give to people are used against us. Most of the people we train turn against us,"" Manchin said Tuesday on CNN's ""New Day."" While lawmakers are expected to put off until after the November election a vote on direct U.S. military action in Syria, votes on arming Syrian rebels could come this week as part of a larger funding bill. The House is slated to vote Wednesday, and the Senate soon after, on a measure that ties funding for the entire government to a measure authorizing the administration to arm Syrian opposition groups. Government funding runs out at the end of September and if new legislation isn't passed, many government services will come to a halt. Manchin, who is opposed to arming the rebels, called tying the two issues together an ""atrocious"" package. ""I'm willing to vote. I will vote no -- absolutely no -- and stand tall in West Virginia to explain my vote,"" he said. Manchin said his critics might say he voted to shut down the government. His response: ""But guess what's wrapped into it, a policy that might get us embroiled (in war) for years and years."" Congressional leaders are reluctant to hold a stand-alone vote on the measure because of the upcoming midterm elections less than two months away. Lawmakers would have to go to their districts and explain their positions to a war-weary public. Manchin is not up for re-election this year. But at least one senator running for re-election has indicated opposition to arming the rebels. Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska, who is in a tight race against Republican Dan Sullivan, said in a statement last week that he opposes the plan ""at this time."" ""I am gravely concerned by reports of ISIS seizing and utilizing U.S. weapons intended for those fighting against the Syrian regime, and we must have greater assurance that we aren't arming extremists who will eventually use the weapons against us,"" Begich added. Manchin also responded to lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who are suggesting that the U.S. approach to ISIS go even further than what President Barack Obama has proposed and include U.S. involvement in a ground war. ""In West Virginia, at least we know the definition of insanity -- doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results,"" he said. ""This has to be a ground game by the people of that region."" War against ISIS: What does Rand Paul's 'yes' mean? CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report"

Former Chiefs of Staff Bill Daley, who worked for Obama from 2011-12; Andrew Card from George W. Bush's White House; Mack McLarty of the Clinton administration; and Ken Duberstein, who worked for Ronald Reagan, sat down with Candy Crowley on Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" All four agreed that the twilight years of a two-term presidency hold drawbacks as well as opportunities. A lame-duck president, they argue, has the opportunity to search for fresh ideas and focus on what the country wants instead of politics. Reagan, Clinton and Bush were able to overcome a narrative of their irrelevancy, according to McLarty. ""I think there is a real opportunity as we've seen in each of these presidencies for the last two years for a lame duck indeed to fly, and there's such a demand and hunger by the American people for leadership to get something done."" Scandals within the Secret Service, the Ebola epidemic and the battle against ISIS fill today's headlines. It's also been a rocky midterm season for Democrats, with Obama's low approval ratings leading some Democratic candidates to keep their distance. In response to critics who say the President has not showed enough leadership in facing these issues, Daley said that if Obama appears as if he's phoning it in, it's a misperception. ""He knows that there are enormous challenges, things that he can control, things he can't: Ebola, ISIL. You've got to address them. It's not as though you can take off, and he knows this better than anyone."" However, Card pointed out that in politics, perceptions are paramount. ""I think he's got to be an aggressive and active leader in all of those categories -- and demonstrate some emotion and commitment that's real."" Card also warned the President away from appearing too consumed with partisan battles and to focus on leadership abroad. ""He kind of stepped on it this past week by basically saying this election is really a referendum on him,"" Card said, referencing a line from the President's speech Thursday. ""That message is not resonating with the American people."" Both Card and McLarty agreed that the President's focus on international leadership on the threat of ISIS, Ebola and relations with Russia is essential for a leader facing gridlock in Congress. ""He's already built an international coalition. He's already beginning to build the right pathway and demonstrate that leadership that the American people have such a strong desire for,"" McLarty said. Dubersteinsaid the President has an opportunity to turn over a new leaf. ""Every two-term president needs some fresh ideas, fresh voices and strong people."" The panel also sounded notes of optimism, saying a new Congress might be just want the President needs. According to Duberstein, trade and tax reform will be attractive issues where Republicans can show leadership. ""They have to demonstrate an ability to govern, the same way President Obama needs to reach out and start building relationships, not just with Democrats but with Republicans."""

A study of more than 1,700 shells fired by ISIS in the Kurdish regions of the two countries found that 20 per cent were manufactured in America. Only ammunition from the former Soviet Union and China were found in greater numbers in a list of 21 countries ranging from Serbia and Romania to North Korea and Sudan. Mark of origin: A survey of ammunition fired by jihadists in Iraq and Syria shows huge numbers of bullets were made in the U.S, including these four rifle cartridges which were manufactured at the U.S.-government owned Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 In the case of the United States, much of the ammunition was likely seized when the jihadists sent Iraqi forces fleeing during its lightning uprising  in June. The report found that many of the 323 U.S.-made cartridges were manufactured between 2000 and 2010 - a period when America was arming the Iraqi army following the second Gulf War. Conflict Armament Research (CAR), which conducted the study, noted in its report: 'IS forces appear to have acquired a large part of their current arsenal from stocks seized from, or abandoned by, Iraqi defence and security forces. 'The U.S. gifted much of this materiel to Iraq.' Analysis of the markings on the bottom of the shells found that many had been made at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Missouri. The shells comprised mainly 5.56 x 45mm cartridges which are used in U.S.-supplied M16 and M4 assault rifles, the report said. Falling into the wrong hands: A study of more than 1,700 shells fired by ISIS fighters (above, file picture) in the Kurdish regions of Syria and Iraq found that 20 per cent were manufactured in America The spent shell casings were collected between July 22 and August 15 by a private arms-tracing group in four Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria. One of those included the Sinjar Mountains where up to 200,000 Yazidis to flee after the terror group stormed the surrounding villages and captured women to be sold as sex slaves. The wide range of countries which supplied the bullets indicates just how nebulous the situation is on the ground in the Middle East, with different factions obtaining weaponry by various means and sources. CAR, a non-profit research organisation funded by the European Union report, said: 'The sample includes ammunition manufactured in 21 countries during a period of nearly 70 years (1945–2014). 'The variety and age of ammunition used by IS forces indicates a large array of ammunition supply sources, which is attributable to the group having captured materiel during numerous engagements and against various opponents, across Iraq and Syria.' Bullets from the Russian federation were much newer - as recent as seven months - suggesting they had been obtained from Syrian forces, the study said.

If confirmed, Lynch, 55, would be the first black woman to serve in the post, bringing with her a family history that stretches back generations to great-great grandparents who were slaves. Obama said he hoped the Senate would confirm Lynch, who he said had distinguished herself as tough and fair in her two stints as the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, which covers Brooklyn, Long Island, Queens and Staten Island, without delay. Lynch would replace Eric Holder, the first black attorney general, who has held the job since Obama took office in 2009. She was among several candidates Holder had recommended to succeed him. 'Loretta might be the only lawyer in America who battles mobsters and drug lords and terrorists and still has the reputation for being a charming people person,' Obama said in announcing the nomination.

The man, thought to be 53-year-old Phu Lam, was found dead after an alleged rampage in which he attacked his victims in two different parts of Edmonton, Canada, before fleeing and taking his own life. Police said that one of the victims was a young boy, and another was a young girl. They also found bodies belonging to four women and two men who were murdered. One of the victims was named late Sunday as 37-year-old Cyndi Duong, who was killed at a separate home to the other seven. Scroll down for video Chilling: Police remove one of the eight victims from a home in Edmonton, Alberta, this morning Eight victims: Police in Edmonton, Alberta, investigate a home where seven bodies, two of them children, were found this morning after reports of a suicidal man Inside: Detectives scour the inside of a building in nearby Fort Saskatchewan, where officers found the alleged killer dead Tuesday morning Officers also say they found a body matching descriptions they received of a suicidal man in a commuter town not from from Edmonton. The Toronto Sun reported that Lam is thought to be the man in question, and was known to police before. Edmonton police chief Rob Knecht called the attacks a 'senseless mass murder', which he said was a result of domestic violence. He later described the killings, carried out with a 9mm handgun which was stolen eight years ago, as 'planned and deliberate' and said they were the city's worst mass killings since 1956. He added the man was well-known to police and had a criminal record dating back to September 1987. Police were called to an address in the south of the town, three hours north of Calgary in the Alberta province, following a weapons complaint. There they found the body of a woman, thought to be in her 30s, who had been shot dead after somebody broke into the house Monday evening, according to state broadcaster CBC. Murder after murder: The above map shows the sites where dead bodies were found by police in and around Edmonton Murdered: The victim above is one of seven found in the same home, to which police were called in the evening before the killings happened They then received calls about a suicidal man from a home elsewhere in the city - but by the time they arrived he had left. The officers checked the home and knocked on the door, but got no response. Police rejected any response they did not do enough. When officers returned after midnight, they found the next seven victims: three women, two men and the two children. All had been shot dead. Duong shared the home where she was found dead with David Luu, 41, according to property records viewed by the Edmonton Journal. Further records reportedly showed the home where seven more bodies were found is owned by Phu Lam and a 35-year-old woman named as Thuy-Tien Truong. According to the Journal, Truong was sued by the Royal Bank in 2013 and Lam filed a bankruptcy proposal in the same year. Neighbours told the Journal a couple with two children - an eight-year-old named locally as Elvis and a toddler - lived in the house alongside an elderly woman. Police tracked the suicidal man to a Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan, a town outside Edmonton, to which Lam has been linked. Officers located a black Mercedes SUV Lam is thought to have been driving. 'Senseless mass murder': Edmonton police chief Rod Knecht spoke at a conference about the spree of murders Explanation: Chief Knecht said the killings seem to be the result of domestic violence Tragedy: The police chief said it was the city's worst mass killing since another in 1956 Police found the vehicle at around 2.30am, but waited until morning to raid the restaurant, where the man was found. Witnesses then described officer blowing down the door, and sending police dogs and robot When they entered around 8.45am today, the man was dead - apparently after killing himself. Police say there is no further danger to the public. Chief Knecht said: 'This series of events are not believed to be random acts. These events do not appear to be gang-related, but rather tragic incidents of domestic violence.' 'Our homicide investigators have established associations and linkages between these homicides,'  he said. Police would not elaborate on the connection between the deaths. Monday, December 29 6.52pm: Officers respond to a 'weapons complaint' at a house in southern Edmonton and discover the body of 37-year-old Cyndi Duong. 8.28pm: An emergency call raises concerns for the welfare of a man - suspected to be Phu Lam, 53 - at a house in north Edmonton. He is seen 'depressed and overly emotional' and a family is concerned he may be suicidal. Neither he nor his vehicle is found, but they do not force their way into the house. Tuesday, December 30 12.23am: Officers return to the same house after 'further investigation and significant disclosure by a second individual'. This time they do force their way inside and find seven bodies - three women, two men, and a boy and a girl both aged under ten - after apparent 'planned and deliberate' murders. 2.20am: Officers find black SUV that matched description of vehicle connected to first murder outside a Vietnamese restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan, where the suspect has a 'business interest'. 8.45am: Officers establish man found dead in restaurant killed himself and was the man they had been looking for since the previous night."

Construction of the inaugural stand continues in front of the White House last week. President Bush raised a record $42.8 million dollars for his second inauguration, and according to Public Citizen, more than 90 percent of the donations to that ceremony were from executives or corporations. But this year, some say throwing a multimillion-dollar party would be unseemly in a time when crash, bailout, and foreclosure fill the economic headlines. ""A lot of it is about tone and making sure that the celebrations that do take place are not over the top, that they don't appear to be insensitive to the pain people have right now,"" said Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. The inaugural committee for Obama and Vice President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to make sure the ceremony underscores the incoming administration's ""commitment to change business as usual in Washington."" The Presidential Inaugural Committee has limited individual contributions to $50,000. There is no law restricting the size of donations, but in the past, inaugural committees  have set contribution limits as high as $250,000. The PIC said it will not take contributions from corporations, political action committees, current federally registered lobbyists, non-U.S. citizens or registered foreign agents. Obama has promised to ""take power away from the corporate lobbyists"" -- a pledge that would be questioned should the president-elect rely on them to foot his inauguration bill. ""If he can pay for these parties with small donations, I think there'd be a lot more acceptance of that,"" Alexander said. Watchdog groups say there are some things Obama can do to take control of the tone. For example, he could make donations to charity, and Michelle Obama could opt for something more reasonably priced than a designer dress. When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, he also faced a financial crisis. He gave voters a now famous pep talk about the failing economy, then skipped the fancy inaugural balls because they sent the wrong message. But analysts say Obama's not expected to go that far because so many people want to celebrate his historic win. ""Washington, D.C., was pro-Obama and had Obama-mania long before November 4. But the moment November 4 occurred, all -- all craziness sort of broke loose,"" said Anne Schroeder Mullini, a gossip columnist for Politico. As inauguration organizers work to keep the tone in check, they are speaking out against those trying to make money by scalping tickets to the event. Tickets for the inauguration are distributed through members of Congress, and just 240,000 seats are available for the actual swearing-in ceremony. The tickets are supposed to be free, but with demand outpacing supply, a traditional giveaway has turned into a thriving online marketplace. Legitimate ticket brokers -- the same companies that peddle tickets to rock concerts and NASCAR races -- are selling tickets to the inauguration for thousands of dollars, even for standing-room areas on the National Mall. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein wants to make that practice a crime, punishable by up to a year in prison. Organizers of the inauguration say it violates the spirit of the event and could spell disappointment for people who buy tickets for the ceremony. ""We think it's absolutely insane to be selling those tickets. We understand some people want to make a buck, but for those people thinking of buying tickets, it's buyer beware,"" warned Howard Gantman, staff director of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. CNN's Carol Costello, Brianna Keilar and Erica Hill contributed to this report."

Despite her determined efforts to look – and sound – youthful, the 56-year-old has been dropped from the station’s playlist that determines which songs are played by DJs during the day. Madonna’s latest song is Living For Love and has been available for airplay since December 20 last year. Scroll down for video Madonna, pictured, has been placed on the Radio 1 no-play list because at 56 she is too old for their listeners Yet it has been played on Radio 1 just once – on January 9 when DJ Annie Mac played it on her evening show. But that was after 7pm, when songs not on the playlist can be broadcast. The track is the first single from the mother of four’s new album, Rebel Heart. The station last night said the single had been omitted from playlists on the basis of ‘audience relevance’ and ‘musical merit’. A Radio 1 insider said: ‘At the end of the day it’s all about relevance. It’s natural that as an artist gets older their audience goes elsewhere and Radio 1 has to reflect that. ‘The station has a duty to meet the needs of younger listeners. I don’t think the audience is losing sleep that it is not playing Madonna in the same way that it used to.’ The snub represents a remarkable fall from grace for the star who notched up 13 UK No 1s between 1985 and 2008. She finds herself alongside Sir Cliff Richard, Take That, Kate Bush and Robbie Williams on a long list of artists who struggle to get new material played on the station.

By contrast, Sir Paul McCartney’s new single will be played by Radio 1 even though the former Beatle is 72. This is because the track is a collaboration with rapper Kanye West, 37, and pop mega-star Rihanna, 26. A Radio 1 spokesman said: ‘Tracks are chosen on musical merit, and while around 40 per cent of the country’s 15 to 29-year-olds tune into Radio 1 each week, an artist’s age is never a factor.’ Madonna’s spokesman declined to comment."

The derby that never really felt like one or sounded like one and, ultimately, was robbed of any significance or real context by the actions of one player. Maybe it was nerves, a sense of neither club knowing where they stood before kick-off. Maybe football is just becoming more gentrified with each passing season. Whatever the case, there was never any fizz about this occasion. Both clubs — both sets of supporters — seemed rather anxious to get it over with and move on. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal slam Chris Smalling for stupid red card Chris Smalling was shown a second yellow card for this first half challenge on James Milner Referee Michael Oliver had no choice but to give Smalling his marching orders following the tackle Then, when it started, Chris Smalling ruined it. A senseless sending off for two pieces of brainless football. The first offence was always going to have one outcome. The second, a tackle so late the TV cameras did well to catch it, was particularly reckless given what had already happened. ‘It wasn’t very smart,’ said Louis van Gaal. The Manchester United manager added that Smalling had apologised. His face suggested the apology had not necessarily been accepted. Smalling’s red card certainly robbed his team. They had some momentum prior to that moment. They had started brightly, seeking to exploit some hesitancy in a strangely lifeless Manchester City. In the wider context, though, Smalling’s dismissal left the occasion and the game distorted. You can never learn much from a 10 versus 11 contest and so it was here. The happiest coach in the land may well be Chelsea’s Jose Mourinho. His team are now 13 points ahead of United so we can presume the Barclays Premier League title challenge for Van Gaal’s side is now over — if it ever existed. Chelsea are as unlikely to lose five times between now and next May as United are to win every game. Smalling was shown his first yellow card of the game for the challenge of Manchester City keeper Joe Hart Louis van Gaal gives instructions to Wayne Rooney shortly after Smalling's red card There were no players from Manchester in either side’s starting XI, but five from Argentina — Aguero, Zabaleta, Demichelis, Rojo and Di Maria. Mourinho will also have sensed ongoing issues among Sunday’s victors. City were only truly effective for half an hour. Certainly they should have had penalties and David de Gea made a couple of very good saves when the teams were numerically equal. In the wake of an excellent Sergio Aguero goal, however, they lost their way. Aimless, unintelligent football returned and if they were not exactly hanging on at the full-time, they were certainly happy to hear Michael Oliver’s whistle. As United pressed late on, Wayne Rooney may have scored — choosing to cut inside instead of shooting — Joe Hart made a super save from Angel di Maria and Marouane Fellaini somehow managed to connect only with his shoulder when escaping from Vincent Kompany at a set piece right in front of goal. Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring City's winning goal at the Etihad on Sunday Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will have sensed that there are ongoing issues at City Had any of those incidents led to a goal, City manager Manuel Pellegrini would have been thinking introspectively yet again on Monday morning. The line his team is walking between good and bad is very fine at the moment and it will be interesting to see if they can find the performance they need at home to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday. From a statistical point of view, there are some numbers to trouble United. This was the fourth time on the spin City have beaten them — the last time that happened was in 1970 — while their own league tally of 13 points represents their worst start to a domestic season since 1986. Manchester United are now 13 points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea Neither of these stats really seemed to fit the mood at full-time on Sunday, though. If you are of a red persuasion you may not feel quite that glum. United do have issues. Players continue to get injured, on the training pitch and in combat, while Robin van Persie continues to look like somebody who has just walked on to the set of Stars in Their Eyes. For the moment at least, meanwhile, the previously excellent Di Maria looks in need of some direction and a more easily identifiable role in Van Gaal’s formation. There is a feeling, though, that Van Gaal does have United stuttering along gently in the right direction. Robin van Persie (right) has struggled to make an impact for United so far this season As he said on Sunday, they continue to have problems with retaining the ball but the calamity football of early season does seem a little distant now. The return of their captain helped. Rooney was excellent in a withdrawn position and one wonders how long it will be before Van Gaal decides to choose Radamel Falcao ahead of him rather than Van Persie. United may yet benefit from not playing European football. Van Gaal clearly needs time on the training field and he perhaps will not mind too much the lack of clutter on the schedule. City do not have that luxury and, it has to be said, they do look a little leggy. Maybe this result will nudge them into gear again and certainly their celebrations at the end were indicative of relief. This will not be a derby that lives long in the memory.

The agency said it is revisiting the safety of chemicals like triclosan in light of recent studies suggesting they can interfere with hormone levels and spur the growth of drug-resistant bacteria. The government's preliminary ruling lends new credence to longstanding warnings from researchers who say the chemicals are, at best, ineffective and at worst, a threat to public health. Under its proposed rule released Monday, the agency will require manufacturers to prove that their antibacterial soaps and body washes are safe and more effective than plain soap and water. Manufacturers will have a year to prove it after the FDA said: 'To put it simply, we need to collect additional information from the companies that make these products so that consumers can be confident about their effectiveness and about their safety.' If companies cannot demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their products, they would have to be reformulated, relabeled or possibly removed from the market. The agency will take comments on its proposal before finalizing it in coming months. 'Due to consumers' extensive exposure to the ingredients in antibacterial soaps, we believe there should be a clearly demonstrated benefit from using antibacterial soap to balance any potential risk,' said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's drug center. 'The proposed rule covers only those antibacterial soaps and washes that are used with water. It does not apply to hand sanitizers, hand wipes or antibacterial soaps that are used in health care setting such as hospitals', the FDA said in their blog. They aim to have their final rule by September 2016. The agency's proposal comes more than 40 years after the agency was first tasked with evaluating triclosan and similar ingredients. At least 2,000 different soap products contain triclosan or some other antimicrobial agent and it is also used in toothpaste to kill germs that cause gum disease, the FDA's Dr. Sandra Kweder said. FDA first tasked started evaluating triclosan 40 years ago - which is an ingredient in antibacterial soaps Ultimately, the government agreed to publish its findings only after a three-year legal battle with the environmental group, Natural Resources Defense Council, which accused the FDA of delaying action on triclosan. The chemical is found in an estimated 75 percent of antibacterial liquid soaps and body washes sold in the U.S. The FDA's preliminary rule only applies to personal hygiene products, but it has implications for a $1 billion industry that includes thousands of antibacterial products, including kitchen knives, toys, pacifiers and toothpaste. Most of the research surrounding triclosan's safety involves animal studies, which cannot always be applied to humans. But some scientists worry the chemical can disrupt hormones in humans too, raising the risk of infertility, early puberty and other developmental problems. Other experts are concerned that routine use of antibacterial chemicals like triclosan is contributing to a surge in drug-resistant germs, or superbugs, that render antibiotics ineffective. In March 2010, the European Union banned the chemical from all products that come into contact with food, such as containers and silverware."

Instantly, there was controversy. Russia's Adelina Sotnikova finished with a total score of 224.59, beating Kim's score of 219.11 by 5.48 points after the free skate program. Sotnikova, 17, became the first female Russian skater to win in the category. Some pointed out that she had stepped out after landing a triple combination, and others raised questions about the anonymous judging system. Dick Button, a men's figure skating two-time Olympic gold medalist, said he didn't think Sotnikova was the whole package. It didn't help that one of the judges had been suspended for a year for trying to fix an event at the Winter Olympics 16 years ago. Or that another is married to the head of the Russian figure skating federation. American figure skater Ashley Wagner also slammed the judging Thursday night. She skated without falling but finished seventh behind several skaters that had stumbled on the ice. She even finished behind Russian skater Julia Lipnitskaia, who fell more than once. ""I feel gypped,"" Wagner said, according to Yahoo! Sports. ""People don't want to watch a sport where you see people fall down and somehow score above someone who goes clean."" 5 moments from Thursday at the Winter Olympics Critics have created a petition at change.org urging that the judging be investigated. Early Friday morning, the petition had more than 1.6 million supporters. Opinions varied on whether the right skater got the gold medal. Sotnikova's program had seven triple jumps, which was one more than Kim's. The final judgment split sports journalists and figure skating experts. ""It's debatable, but not a robbery,"" wrote Chris Chase of USA Today. ""Sotnikova skated well enough to win gold. She had a carefully constructed program with seven triples, five of which were in a combo. Kim had six and three, respectively. Thus, Sotnikova was going in with a higher total and made more margin for error, which she took advantage of with a minor hop after one exchange."" Sotnikova's technical score of 75.54 dwarfed Kim's technical score of 69.69. Results: Women's figure skating results But others weren't convinced. Kurt Browning, a four-time world champion, told The New York Times: ""I just couldn't see how Yu-na and Sotnikova were so close in the components. I was shocked. What, suddenly, she just became a better skater overnight? I don't know what happened. I'm still trying to figure it out."" Italy's Carolina Kostner took the bronze. Kim was looking to be only the third woman to defend her Olympic figure skating title, joining Katarina Witt, who took to the ice in Calgary 26 years ago, and Sonja Henie, who competed in the 1920s and '30s. In 2010, she took gold in the Vancouver Olympics by a landslide, where she scored a record 228.56 points to win in women's figure skating. She eclipsed her closest rival by a massive 23.06 points. Known as ""Queen Yuna"" to her legions of fans, Kim's victory in Vancouver made her the first Korean figure skater to win a gold medal. CNN's Lateef Mungin contributed to this report."

Salvo said Mr Lim has proposed that the purchase be completed by the middle of next month to allow the club time to spend money on players before the transfer window closes on January 31.

Exactly a decade ago, Valencia were at the halfway point of a season which saw them win both the La Liga title and the UEFA Cup. But the club has been mired in financial difficulties following Spain's economic crisis and currently lie 11th in La Liga with interim manager Nico Estevez in charge following the sacking of Miroslav Djukic earlier this month. Construction on the new 75,000-seat Mestalla Stadium was halted in 2009 and a host of star players, including David Villa, David Silva and Juan Mata, have been sold in recent seasons to help service huge debts. If 60-year-old Lim's bid is successful then he will join a growing list of foreign investors in La Liga and across other European leagues. Fellow La Liga outfit Malaga were bought for a reported $80 million by Qatar's Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Al-Thani in 2010 with the Qatar Investment Authority buying a 70% share of Ligue 1's Paris St Germain in 2011.

And when it comes to Mars and Snickers treats we’ll be doing just that from now on whether we like it or not… but the manufacturer claims it’s all for our own good. Mars UK is shrinking the size of its two most popular bars again and it says it is doing so to help quell the obesity crisis. However, the move will actually make our purses lighter as the price is staying the same. Shrinking bars: Both Mars and Snickers bars have been reduced in size by more than 10 per cent but the recommended selling price has remained the same The company said the decision to reduce Mars from 58g to 51g and Snickers from 58g to 48g is part of a pledge to cut the calorie count of its products to a maximum of 250. A spokesman added: ‘To meet our commitment, having taken product reformulation as far as we can for now without compromising the great taste, we have reduced the portion size of Mars and Snickers to bring down the calories.’ Mars will now have 229 calories and Snickers will have 245. In 2008, the company also reduced the bars’ size, from 62.5g to 58g. The chocolate giant committed early in 2012 to cut the calorie content of its single-serve products to a maximum of 250 calories by the end of 2013 as part of its calorie reduction Responsibility Deal pledge. As a result of the size changes, the number of calories in a Mars bar has dropped from 260 to 229 and in a Snickers bar from 280 to 245. Mars said it had little choice but to reduce the size of the products because there was a limit to what could now be achieved through reformulation. In 2010, it cut the saturated fat content of a Mars bar by 15 per cent and removed all transfats. A Mars spokesman told The Grocer: 'As part of our global commitment to promote responsible consumption, and as a signatory of the Responsibility Deal's calorie reduction pledge, we said we would ensure that all our single-serve chocolate products would contain no more than 250 calories per portion. 'To meet our commitment, having taken product reformulation as far as we can for now without compromising the great taste, we have reduced the portion size of Mars and Snickers to bring down the calorie content.' The Grocer magazine says that it is not the first time that Mars has reduced the size of Mars and Snickers. In 2008, it cut the size of both products from 62.5g to 58g while leaving the price the same. Mars has reduced the size of the bars in the wake of big hikes in the cost of chocolate-making over the past decade and cost inflation was particularly severe this year. Mars bars have been reduced from 58g to 51g to ensure they contain less than 250 calories In analysis for The Grocer in October, commodity pricing specialists Mintec said that cost of producing an average milk chocolate bar had soared by 25 per cent year-on-year, adding 6p to the cost of making a 100g bar of plain milk chocolate. The main culprit for soaring costs was the rocketing price of cocoa butter which has been hit by adverse weather in the Ivory Coast - one of the most important growing countries. In March this year, researchers from consumer watchdog Which? discovered that big name food producers have reduced pack sizes by as much as a quarter without reducing the price. They found that 'underhand' and 'hidden price hikes' were on many items including frozen foods, bags of sweets and crisps and dishwasher tablets. Which? said many everyday products now offer poorer value for money because of the 'hidden price hikes'. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't. 'We want simpler pricing so people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest, and for special offers to be genuine.' When the magazine asked the makers of these products why they had shrunk them, they were generally told that, in the face of rising costs they chose to shrink products rather than increase prices. But a survey of 1,257 Which? members found that well over half - 58 per cent - said they would rather prices rose than packs got smaller. A further 37 per cent would rather the pack shrank, but only if they were told. Earlier this year, former public health minister Anna Soubry described Mars' calorie reduction pledge as ' absolutely brilliant.' She told The Grocer: 'They don't have to do it but are doing it for all the right reasons.'"

In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, former Chivas USA human resources director Cynthia Craig has alleged that a culture of harassment and discrimination caused her departure. The African-American claims she was forced out of her job in July by the team's owner Jorge Vergara and president, Jose David, because she was not Mexican and could not speak Spanish. Team plan: Billionaire Jorge Vergara has been accused of trying to 'Mexicanize' Chivas USA The former youth academy coaches, Daniel Calichman and Teddy Chronopoulos, have also alleged that they were victims of the team's purging of non-Mexican players and coaches, according to Fox News. The men, who are both white, filed their complaint in May. Since assuming majority ownership of Chivas USA in August last year, Mr Vergara made it clear he wanted to replicate the team of the same name in Guadalajara, Mexico, in order to attract the large Mexican population in Los Angeles. According to the 2012 census, more than four million Mexicans live in the area. The original Mexican Chivas pro-team has only hired Mexican players since 1908, according to CNN. In the lawsuit brought by Mr Chronopoulos and Mr Calichman, attorney Greg Helmer said: 'Mr Vergara undertook a systemic effort to reverse what he perceived as the ""Americanization"" of Chivas USA and to implement a discriminatory employment policy similar to the ethnocentric ""Mexican only"" policy that exists at Chivas de Guadalajara.' Mr Helmer told Fox News: 'In the U.S. and in California, sports franchises have to abide by the same rules and laws that all employers are required to follow, including the laws prohibiting employment discrimination.' Appeal: Chivas USA's owner is said to be trying to make the team appeal to the large Mexican population in Los Angeles It is claimed that in a staff meeting in November, Mr Vergara asked, in Spanish, for those who could speak the language to raise their hands. After identifying employees who did not speak Spanish, he allegedly told them they were fired. In her lawsuit, Ms Craig said it felt like 'ethnic cleansing'. Mr Chronopoulos has alleged that after the meeting, newly appointed team president Mr David asked him to research the ethnicity of current youth academy players and coaches. The request and recent changes led to Mr Chronopoulos and Mr Calichman filing a harassment and discrimination complaint with the team's human resources department. Three days later however, the men were asked to leave. Since Mr Vergara took over about seven non-Latino academy employees, including the two coaches, have had their contracts terminated, the lawsuit said. 'In contrast, no Latino employees have been terminated,' the suit states, according to CNN. Many non-Spanish speaking players have joined the youth program for LA Galaxy, which Chivas shares a stadium with. SB Nation pointed out however, that while many players may have a Latino background, most of the team is American. A spokesman for Chivas USA declined to comment on the legal matter. Checks: Chivas USA play against Vancouver, above. One of the men in the lawsuit claims he was asked to look up the ethnicity of players and staff Major League Soccer has not made any public statements about the alleged discrimination. 'We are well aware of the allegations made by ex-players and employees of Chivas USA,' MLA's executive vice president, communications, Dan Courtemanche said. 'it would not be appropriate for us to say anything more when the litigation is ongoing,' he told Fox News, but added that Chivas USA has players from 15 countries."

Senior Tory sources yesterday said that Labour had spent too much money on the 2008 bailouts, which injected £66billion of public funds into the failing banks. They spoke after fresh reports the Chancellor is gearing up to sell an 82 per cent shareholding in RBS and a 39 per cent stake in Lloyds. The Daily Mail first revealed in February that Mr Osborne wants to offload the shares before the 2015 election – and that he is examining the possibility of giving the shares away. That would mean acknowledging taxpayers would not get all their money back, since the share prices of the two banks currently mean the deficit on paper is £24billion. Several Treasury ministers believe a big privatisation would show the Coalition is drawing a line under the financial crisis and would boost confidence in the economy. They hope that selling off – or giving away – the shares would kickstart trading in RBS and Lloyds shares and drive up the price, allowing them to get more money back. But a minister close to the Chancellor told the Financial Times it was ‘unrealistic’ to expect the RBS share price to return to its 2008 level in the foreseeable future and the Government may have to sell while the shares were ‘under water’. Insiders say Mr Osborne is prepared to make the argument that it would be better to get some money back and move on, rather than wait around with the bank shares on the public balance sheet with little prospect of ever getting taxpayers’ money back. A senior Tory source told the Mail: ‘It is true Labour hugely overpaid for the original recapitalisation.’ For sale: The Chancellor is gearing up to sell off a 39 per cent stake in Lloyds Bleak outlook: The Chancellor told the Financial Times it was ¿unrealistic¿ to expect the RBS share price to return to its 2008 level in the foreseeable future It was reported earlier this week that Mr Osborne’s team hope former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling will be criticised for paying over the odds by the cross-party parliamentary banking standards commission when it reports in June. That will make it easier to argue that the Government should sell its shares under the break-even mark. Ripped off: Former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling will be criticised for paying over the odds by the cross-party parliamentary banking standards commission when it reports in June But Mr Darling has criticised the attempt to point the finger of blame at Labour, saying that in April 2010 – just before the last election – RBS shares were trading above the price the Treasury paid. ‘I’ve not the slightest doubt all of this is a rather obvious attempt to blame the last Labour government for whatever they do,’ he said. ‘The share price we see today is largely of their own making.’ But there have also been rumours that the cross-party commission on banking standards, led by Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, might recommend splitting RBS into a ‘good’ high street bank, with a ‘bad’ bank taking on its toxic loans. The Archbishop of Canterbury, who is a member of the commission, has said he would like to see RBS broken up into a series of regional banks. Sources at RBS said any sell-off was a decision for the Government but bank bosses were not adverse to moves that hasten a return to the private sector. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘This is all speculation. We will sell our stakes when it is in the taxpayers’ interest to do so.’"

Sandra Borch, a former youth leader for Norway's Centre party, posted the pictures of her wearing a wolf fur coat on her Facebook page. The move provoked angry criticism from animal rights campaigners She told VG newspaper: 'I knew there would be reactions, but I want to show that I do not care.' Almost as soon as Ms Borch published the picture, people began to leave angry posts. Ms Borch has argued in the past that hunters should be allowed to kill wolves to protect their livestock The politician has argued that Norwegian farmers should be given permission to hunt and kill wolves, to help protect their livestock. Siri Martinsen, the leader of the animal rights organization NOAH, condemned Ms Borch's statement, claiming the stunt was designed to provoke a reaction. She said: 'This initiative is quite predictable for a politician who so strongly advocates the killing of wolves and the use of fur, with all the suffering it inflicts animals. 'She's doing this very clearly to provoke, but I'm pretty sure it does not change the attitude of large sections of the population in Norway who say 'no' to the hunting of wolves and who are critical of the fur industry.' The Progress Party - the junior party in Norway's right-wing government - has said it has no objection to the complete eradication of wolves. At the start of each hunting season there are normally around 50 of the animals in the country. That number is expected to fall to just 20 by the close of the season, with some moving across the border to Sweden but many killed at the hands of the hunters."

Elaine Willis, 49, was booked on a return Flybe flight from Manchester International Airport to Edinburgh. Mrs Willis of Stockport, Cheshire, was going through security when she realised she’d picked up her 16-year-old son Jamie's passport by mistake. Remarkably, she managed to board both her flights without any issue. Elaine Willis used her son Jamie's passport as photo ID to travel from Manchester airport to Edinburgh Mrs Willis' 16-year-old son's passport. The mother further managed to return to Manchester from Edinburgh using the same passport as photographic ID A handful of airlines fly domestically, including EasyJet, Ryanair, bmibaby, British Airways and Virgin, who recently began a route between London and Edinburgh. Many ask for photographic ID at check-in gates for commercial reasons rather than security reasons. According to the Flybe website, a passenger must show one of the following forms of ID to fly domestically: All passengers on Flybe international flights must be in possession of a valid passport and a valid visa if required. According to their website, Flybe insist passengers must present one of several forms of identification to board an aircraft for domestic travel. A pension book is the only acceptable form of non-photographic ID, it adds. Speaking today, a spokesperson from Flybe said the company require photo ID for commercial reasons and not for security. They added there had not been a breach of security by letting Mrs Ellis on the flight. The mother said: ‘I got to the airport early to meet up with the girls for a weekend away to Edinburgh and it was only as we went through the security that I realised I had the wrong passport. ‘I was stood in the security queue when I just thought ‘did I pick up the right passport?’ ‘My face went white when I realised I only had Jamie’s passport and it went round the rest of the group like wildfire. ‘I rang my next door neighbours on each side and got one to scan over my passport as a text, but I realised he’d have no time to get it to the airport before the flight. ‘I decided not to risk telling them about the mix up and there was lots of angst on my part. ‘But I couldn’t believe it when they let me through - none of us thought for a minute that I would get through on a young boy’s passport. The checks were clearly very poor. ‘Once I got on the flight my neighbour passed my passport on to a teacher friend Alma Bell, who was flying up later in the day. ‘I thought then that I wouldn’t have a problem getting back, but on the return the girls suggested I see if it could happen twice.' A few days later, Mrs Willis attempted to return to Manchester using her son's passport. She said: ‘Amazingly on the Sunday out of Edinburgh exactly the same happened - nobody noticed that it wasn’t my passport. ‘It was even more unbelievable that I could do the same thing on the way back. It was absolutely astonishing. ‘In the light of what has happened to the Malaysian Airlines it is clear that security checks at airports have become much more lax and people making the checks must be much more careful for the sake of everyone’s safety. Mrs Willis with the passport. Flybe insist on photographic ID for domestic travel - with a pension book being the only acceptable form of non-photographic ID Manchester International Airport - where Mrs Willis boarded her flight. A spokesman said today it is down to the airline to check passports ‘Mine was an entirely innocent mistake with no bad intent at all, but we all know that there are people out there who want to bring terror to the skies above Britain, Europe and the USA and they need to be caught before any more people die.’ A spokesman for Flybe said: 'Flybe can confirm that there is no requirement for passengers to be in possession of a passport or any other form of photographic ID to fly domestically within the UK. 'Despite this however, Flybe does have a policy to determine for its own purposes, a passenger’s identity. 'Other methods can be, and are, used to satisfy this requirement and enable them to travel and we will be taking up the matter of Mrs Willis’ travel with our airports and our third-party check-in agents.' A spokesman for Manchester International Airport said: ‘It isn’t airport staff who check passports. It is down to the airline and depends on Flybe policy. ‘She was flying within the UK, but people returning from overseas it is the Border Agency that checks passports.’ A spokesman from Edinburgh Airport said: 'There are no legal obligations for a passenger to carry their passport when flying within the UK. 'When flying domestically, each airline specifies its own identification requirements.'"

When police caught up with Hill on Saturday, he kept them at bay for eight hours atop a cliff in West Hills, said Officer Bruce Borihanh. To take Hill into custody, officers used their stun guns on him - at which point he fell, Borihanh said. Police said Hill jumped, but also added it was unclear what caused his death.

The home was being used to make pornographic films, but shoots had ended for the day. Authorities said Hill was at the house, socializing with some coworkers.

The filing asks the court to order Sheehan to comply. Sheehan, of Vacaville, told CNN affiliate KXTV she has not paid federal incomes taxes since 2004 -- and has not disguised the fact.

Criticising the festive period as ‘over the top’, Justin Welby said that high-spending in an attempt to create the perfect Christmas risked making life miserable. But in a frank admission, the former oil executive said nobody would ‘pay attention’ to his message about the obsession with material goods. In a warning to hard-pressed families across the UK, Archbishop Welby said: ‘Save up for the Christmas budget, be sensible, don’t put pressure on your finances – don’t make your life miserable with Christmas.’ His description of the festive period as ‘absurd and ridiculous’ follows research that suggests the average family spends £1,000 on Christmas. The stark assessment of Christmas celebrations are his first comments on the Christian festival since taking over as Archbishop. He said: ‘The Christian bit of Christmas isn’t the bit that’s getting people into debt. ‘It’s the whole mercantile trading, shopping, over-the-topness, so I don’t feel guilty about it.’ Admitting that our obsession with shopping is unlikely to wane, he said that people should show ‘love and affection rather than trying to buy love and affection’. He added: ‘You can’t buy it, you can show it, and when you show it, it comes back to you with interest. ‘Share love and affection with reasonable gifts that demonstrate you really care for someone’. During the interview for ITV’s The Martin Lewis Money Show, the Archbishop admitted his comments were unlikely to make a difference. He said: ‘It’s a cliché of modern life that someone gets up and says Christmas is becoming very materialistic, as though it wasn’t 300 years ago. 'Yes, obviously the secular over-the-topness, everything you have to have, new clothes you have to have, new this, new that, new the other, is ridiculous, it’s absurd, it shouldn’t happen. ‘It’s obviously not what Christmas is about but to be absolutely honest there’s not much point in saying it because nobody’s going to pay attention.’ 'It's obviously not what Christmas is about': Thousands of shoppers trudge along Oxford Street in the gathering gloom last December.

Whatling, who was next to me at both airports, said: ""He's transformed from a baby to a toddler in the course of a royal tour."" Grumpy George? Newspapers and websites have been having fun with some of George's faces. So is he really grumpy? ""No,"" says Whatling. ""He's got lovely chubby cheeks and he's full of expression.

The victims of Friday night's crash were 22-year-old David Cheney, of Beverly, Massachusetts; 24-year-old Marcelo Rugini, an exchange student from Brazil; and 24-year-old William 'B.J.' Hannigan III, of South Portland, Maine. All three were members of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Cheney was the fraternity's president. Killed: David Cheney, left, and B.J. Hannigan, right, were killed in a plane crash in Maine on Friday night 'UMaine's Greek and international student communities are mourning the loss of three of their own, but they are not alone in their grief,' said Robert Dana, vice president for student affairs and dean of students. 'Losing these three young men - David, Marcelo and B.J. - is a loss for the entire UMaine community and the many people - including faculty and staff - whose lives they touched. They brought great light and energy to our campus, and we will miss them.' Fraternity brothers: Marcelo Rugini was the third of the victims, who met through their frat house Their Cessna 172 was believed to be traveling about 100mph and had just gone airborne when it clipped a pickup truck that was driving across the runway. The plane kept climbing for a brief few seconds, reaching an altitude of about 100 feet, witnesses said. Then it veered eastward and spiraled down about 300 yards into a thickly-wooded area nearby and burst into flames, according to Knox County Chief Deputy Sheriff Tim Carroll. The collision sent flames 10 to 20 feet in the air and smoke billowing into the sky, police said. One fraternity brother, senior Lucas Bernardi, told the Bangor Daily News that the three had flown out of Bangor International Airport earlier in the day and then toward Lincoln County over a farm where one of the victims had worked over the summer. He said one of the victims had just earned his pilot's licence and wanted to take his friends for a fun ride. 'It wasn't the first time they had been flying,' Mr Bernardi told the newspaper. 'I was supposed to go with them, but I didn't.' Mr Hannigan, who graduated from the university in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, was piloting the plane and had been working on his flight hours, Dana said. Mr Cheney was a business major. Mr Rugini, who was from the town of Muliterno in southern Brazil, was an economics major. Search: Authorities combed the woods nearby to find the wreckage and remains of the victims Tragic: University officials paid tributes to the three young men who died in the accident Lambda Chi Alpha has been in touch with the victims' families and has been keeping the university informed, Mr Dana said. Fraternity members gathered in solidarity at their campus house Saturday night, and a police officer was stationed outside to keep away the media, the Bangor Daily News reported. The first people to the scene tried unsuccessfully to pull one of the occupants from the burning wreckage, said John Newcomb, president of the Downeast Air airline services company, who was among those who tried to help. The pickup truck that was struck by the plane was allowed to be at the airport and was driven by a pilot who was picking up another pilot who had parked a plane in a hangar, Mr Carroll said. Crash course: A Cessna 172 similar to this one crashed after hitting a truck that was crossing the runway just as the four-seater tried to take flight Accident scene: Firefighters had difficulty accessing the woods around Knox County Regional Airport to extinguish the fiery plane crash that killed three Friday night All trucks at the airport are equipped with radios to pick up any traffic from planes, according to airport manager Jeff Northgraves. He said planes are required to radio their positions before, during and after takeoff. It is not yet known if the plane that crashed had radioed its actions.

A new study reveals organic foods are not necessarily healthier than non-organic food Year on year the organic food market grows as consumers look to make a greener and -- often thought -- more nutritional choice. A report by the UK's Soil Association revealed that consumers there spent a record $3.7 billion on organic products in 2006, that's more than 20 percent growth on 2005 spending on organic goods including food, drinks and health and beauty products. It's a similar story in the U.S. where -- according to the Organic Trade Association -- supermarket chains like Whole Foods have helped the organic food and beverage market grow from around $1 billion in sales in 1990 to around $20 billion in 2007. Total sales for organic food and non-food products in the U.S. are expected to surpass $25 billion this year. However, one possible spanner in the works for the organic sector could be the results of a new study by the University of Copenhagen which revealed that organic foods contained no more nutrients than non-organic foods grown with the use of pesticides. Researchers studied five different crops -- carrots, kale, mature peas, apples and potatoes -- which were cultivated both organically (without pesticides) and conventionally (with the use of pesticides) and found that there was no higher level of trace elements in the food grown organically. Study leader Dr Susanne Bügel said: ""No systematic differences between cultivation systems representing organic and conventional production methods were found across the five crops so the study does not support the belief that organically grown foodstuffs generally contain more major and trace elements than conventionally grown foodstuffs."" This study -- published in the latest edition of the Society of Chemical Industry's (SCI) ""Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture"" -- is the first to assess the nutritional value of organic fruit and vegetables. It should be noted that the study does not make conclusions about the comparative levels of pesticides or chemicals in conventionally and organically grown food or the health effects of consuming such chemicals. The study results could be seen to support the idea that shopping organically is a lifestyle choice. When the idea of organics being a lifestyle choice was floated in 2007 by then UK environment secretary David Miliband it drew fierce reaction from proponents of organic food, including the Soil Association, which represents organic producers. He told the UK's Sunday Times newspaper in January 2007 that organic food represented a lifestyle choice consumers could make and suggested that the use of chemicals and pesticides in non-organic foods didn't necessarily mean they were of inferior quality. So if organic foods aren't necessarily more nutritional, are they better for the environment? According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, traditional agriculture accounts for around 11 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, and the nitrous oxide found in fertilizers contributes most to these emissions. Even still, in 2006 the UK's Manchester Business School assessed the environmental impacts of food production and consumption and concluded that there isn't a clear cut answer to whether the environmental impact is greater on a trolley full of organic food compared to a trolley full of non-organic food. Not so, was the response from the Soil Association. Do you believe organic food is more nutritional? It countered that: ""Overall, organic farming is better for tackling climate change than industrial agricultural methods. As well as lower average energy use, organic farming also avoids the very large nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer manufacture."" ""Additionally, organic farming builds up soil carbon, removing it from the atmosphere. Organic farming also supports more local food marketing, reducing food miles."" While the jury might still be out about whether organic farming is, on the whole, better for the environment, there is little doubt that it's a booming industry which is starting to catch on in other parts of the world. The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that organic farming now accounts for around 4.1 million hectares in Asian countries like India, China and Russia. In India where the Green Revolution in the 1940s helped transform it into an agricultural hub, organic farming is slowly expanding in specialist areas like tea and spices. Perhaps an indication of the potential of the organics market there is that the Prince of Wales is looking to expand his organic food business to the sub-continent by the end of 2008. With a mandate of sustainability, The Energy and Research Institute (TERI) in India developed an organic farm in the small village of Supi in Uttarakhand in 2002. Here, local farmers are given the know-how and technical skills to develop their own organic enterprises. ""Local farmers are involved in cultivating oregano, parsley, thyme, peppermint, rosemary, rose geranium, artimisia, stevia, lemon grass, and several other herbal and medicinal plants,"" TERI's Madhu Singh Sirohi told CNN. The herbs are commercially available to hotels and restaurants in the area and Hilton Hotel executive chef Kuntal Kumar was so impressed with the quality, he's authored an organic cookbook which makes use of the herbs. Chef Kumar told CNN that organic fruit and vegetables only make up around 14,000 tons of the two million tons of food produced by India's agricultural industry, but that measures like the ""Original Organics Cookbook"" would help with wider awareness. ""Our approach is two pronged; firstly we are trying to build awareness about organic farming which is in its infancy in India and secondly we are trying to build awareness within the culinary industry in India."" Kumar is sold on the superior taste, color and texture of the organic foods he uses in his kitchen, and he says the response from diners has been overwhelming. ""The response has been very positive; they are overwhelmed that we are going so close to nature and that their food is fresh from the farmland to the table."" With increased consumer awareness perhaps it won't be long before the choice between the organic and non-organic apples will be played out in markets across India."

The state grand jury declined to vote an indictment in November, and news reports indicate that there will be no federal charges against him either. Whether these decisions are correct or not, they underline the difficulty of using criminal prosecutions as vehicles for large-scale reform. Criminal investigations are based on close analysis of what happened at a particular time and place. Brown's death at Wilson's hands is a classic example. At one level, the events of August 9 in Ferguson are undisputed. Brown robbed a convenience store. Moments later, he and Wilson had a confrontation at the window of Wilson's patrol car -- during which Wilson's gun fired. Brown, who was unarmed, walked away. Wilson pursued him and shot him dead. Outside of those facts, however, the details remain murky to this day. Who was the aggressor? What happened in the confrontation at the patrol car? Did Brown do anything to justify Wilson's decision to fire the fatal shots? Appropriately, these questions have been at the heart of the state and federal investigations. But these detailed questions about what happened between Brown and Wilson tell us little about the larger issues raised by the confrontation in Ferguson. What's it like for African-Americans who interact with the police? How do white police officers behave in largely minority communities? How can African-Americans receive dignified, equal treatment from the police -- and how can the police do their jobs in ways that keep themselves and their communities safe? How can better training of officers, more diversity in police forces and community policing make our communities safer? It's understandable to try to use cases such as those of Michael Brown and Eric Garner as metaphors for the larger issues we face as a society. We understand the world in stories, in narratives, and we use those stories to justify how we see the broader world. It's easier to try to figure out the nature of a confrontation between one civilian and one police officer than to parse the statistics that describe larger patterns of behavior. But these are two fundamentally different undertakings. Determining the distance between Wilson and Brown when the fatal shots were fired is a critical step in determining whether Wilson is guilty of a crime. But determining that distance will tell us very little about race relations in the United States. Symbols are important, but it's dangerous to think that symbolic criminal prosecutions are ever appropriate. The criminal law functions best when it is closely tethered to the facts of an individual case. Like defendants should always be treated in the same way; once a society starts singling out certain individuals as ""symbols"" of larger problems, that automatically distorts the system. Wilson deserves no worse (and no better) than to be treated like everyone else despite the symbolic importance his case has taken on. The same, of course, is true for the New York City police officers who caused the death of Garner, in Staten Island, on July 17. The failure to file criminal charges against Wilson, of course, should not be seen as a vindication of Wilson, the Ferguson police force or police officers generally. We live in a society where there are supposed to be substantial barriers to successful criminal prosecutions, like the highest standard of proof -- beyond a reasonable doubt. As a society, we care deeply, as we should, that innocent people are never convicted. But one individual's liberation should not be taken to mean that the whole society is free from scrutiny, or censure. There is much more work to do, regardless of what happens to Darren Wilson, or any other individual."

Court documents contend that the jet-setting, gun-obsessed multimillionaire was in possession of chemicals that, when combined, create pure TNT. The incident comes just days after a model accused Blizerian of kicking her in the face at a Miami Beach nightclub. The owner of the club LIV told TMZ Tuesday that Blizerian has been banned from the establishment. But that may be just the beginning of Blizerian's legal troubles, as the woman at the center of the incident, Vanessa Castano, filed a lawsuit against him Wednesday, calling the burly Internet bad boy a 'menacing trust fund recipient,' according to the gossip site.

But a closer inspection reveals a clever prosthetic in the place of the thumb. The silicone digit is the work of a German company, who specialise in individually-tailored prosthetics to meet the unique needs of people who lose fingers, hands, toes, feet or legs. The work is the brainchild of designers Alex Stamos and Christoph Braun, of Stamos and Braun Prosthesenwerk. At first glance, this picture appears to show a normal hand. But a closer inspection reveals there is a prosthetic digit in the place of the thumb, so life-like it is almost impossible to spot The silicone prosthesis is the work of German company Stamos Braun Prothesenwerk, who aim to create individual designs tailored to each patient Mr Braun said the ethos behind their designs is creating silicone prosthetic works of art. He said his partner started working with silicone 14 years ago, while he joined five years ago. Mr Braun, who has 18 years experience creating traditional prosthetics, told MailOnline: 'Individuality comes first. For every person and his or her needs are unique, and so are the restorations. 'Here each restoration is a small work of art. 'Alex does more of the individual silicone work while I build the prosthetic under the glove. 'We started our own business six months ago in Dresden, Germany with our special image and special prosthetics. 'We thought we need to make something special. We like to show people that a prosthetic doesn't need to look old and ugly. 'We like to give a good feeling to the patients. It is bad enough that they have lost something. 'So if we are able to make them happy with something cool, it feels good to everybody.' The prostheses vary in the time they take to craft, depending on the type of limb required and the level of customisation needed The company, which also creates artistic prosthetics, left, was started by Alex Stamos and Christoph Braun, right, six months ago in Dresden, Germany Christoph Braun, who has 18 years experience creating traditional prosthetics, said: 'Individuality comes first. For every person and his or her needs are unique, and so are the restorations' He said each prosthetic is individually designed and tailored to ensure the right skin colour is match and the prosthetic is as comfortable as possible. As a result the time it takes to create each prosthetic varies, case by case. 'If we only have a little thumb we can make it in one to two days,' he told MailOnline. 'But if we make an individual silicone cover for the whole arm or leg it will take us up to one week. 'And it also depends on the stump situation, sensitivity, the healing process and the wishes of the patient.' He said it is the finer details that make the difference, with finger and toenails crafted from acrylic, the same material used in beauty salons create fake nail extensions. Mr Braun admitted while the prosthetics they create are more realistic, they do not function as well as those with built-in bionics. But he said they allow people to live their day-to-day lives normally, and even allow musicians to continue playing their instruments. The prosthetics range in cost from £1,460 to £5,000 depending on the type of prosthetic and the time it takes to craft the false limb."

A memorial stone recalls the place of the Munich air disaster in Kirchtrudering near Munich. Eight players lost their lives on February 6, 1958, when Flight 609 ZU crashed on the third attempt to take off after re-fuelling in Germany as United returned from knocking Red Star Belgrade out of the European Cup. Sir Matt Busby's side, back-to-back English champions and well positioned for a hat-trick attempt, were arguably on course to become the best United team. The United players killed at Munich were Geoff Bent, aged 25, Roger Byrne(28), Eddie Colman (21),  Mark Jones (24), David Pegg (22), Tommy Taylor (26), Liam Whelan (22) and 21-year-old Duncan Edwards who died in hospital 15 days after the crash. They and the other 15 people who lost their lives will be remembered with a commemorative service at Old Trafford while a short ceremony, organised by supporters, will also take place at the memorial site in Kirchtrudering, on the outskirts of Munich. In keeping with tradition, United supporters will also gather under the memorial plaque at Old Trafford where the clock is fixed at the exact time of the final fateful take-off attempt. Later in the day, a minute's silence will take place ahead of England's friendly with Switzerland at Wembley as a further mark of respect. As he bows his head during this week's Munich commemorations, survivor  Harry Gregg's mind will understandably flash back to that snow-laden runway, but only briefly. The 75-year-old Ulsterman prefers not to remember the afternoon he lost so many friends among the victims, but instead the days when the dream of the 'Busby babes' was still vibrant and alive. Goalkeeper Gregg, hailed a hero in the wake of the crash after returning to the wreckage to pull out survivors, is adamant those are the times which always burn brightest in his memory. ""I was part of something that was a very, very beautiful thing at that time,"" said Gregg, who cost United a record 23,000 pounds sterling when he joined from Doncaster Rovers two months before the disaster. ""I'll always be proud of that.

David Ward tweeted on Tuesday night: ‘The big question is – if I lived in Gaza, would I fire a rocket? Probably, yes.’ Continuing his rant, he added: ‘Ich bin ein Palestinian – the West must make up its mind which side it is on.’ Amid a growing storm of controversy, Mr Ward issued a statement which Lib Dem HQ insisted amounted to a 'categorical apology'. He said: 'I utterly condemn the violence on both sides in Israel and Gaza. 'I condemn the actions of Hamas, and my comments were not in support of firing rockets into Israel. If they gave the opposite impression, I apologise.' He added: 'However, while I defend the right of Israel to exist and defend itself, I will continue to speak out for the rights of the Palestinian people who are facing untold suffering. More must be done by the world community to end this humanitarian crisis and protect the families living in Gaza. I can understand their plight and desperation. 'A ceasefire in this conflict is essential. If we are to end the suffering, and establish a safer society for people in Gaza, the first step must be an end to violence on both sides.' However, Mr Clegg has made no decision on whether to kick Mr Ward out of the party, despite him being carpeted last year for making comments seen as anti-Semitic. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps insisted Mr Ward’s ‘appalling’ comment was ‘essentially an incitement to violence’. Former defence secretary Liam Fox declared: ‘Firing missiles against a civilian population is unforgivable at best, and a war crime at worst. 'That a party politician and member of Parliament should say something so irresponsible demonstrates why he and his party are unfit for office. This is now a question of ethics for the party leadership.’ Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi has written to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, urging him to investigate Mr Ward for encouragement of terrorism. Mr Zahawi wrote in the letter: 'Freedom of speech is an important right but it is not an unqualified one. This is especially true for public figures who have the capacity to influence the actions of others. 'Mr Ward's tweets would appear to be prima facie evidence that he has committed the offence of encouragement of terrorism as defined by Section 1(2) of the Terrorism Act 2006. 'Mr Ward may or may not have intended this statement to encourage others to fire rockets from Gaza into Israel, but regrettably he would appear to at least have been reckless as to whether others would be encouraged to commit such acts.' His comments came as militants in Gaza fire rockets into Israel as the region again erupts into conflict Mr Ward’s comments were made late last night. Earlier in the day, he posted the message: ‘Sick of the mantra (that) 'Israel has the right to defend itself'. Palestinians have same right! Gaza rockets (are fired) because of failure in dealing with Israel.’ Mr Ward has a majority of just 365 in a constituency with a large Muslim population. Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, said: ‘It’s no surprise to see that David Ward would kill Israelis. And no surprise that he still has the Lib Dem whip.' And Charlotte Henry, a prominent Lib Dem activist and blogger, said his comments were ‘cowardly’, adding: ‘No human cannot be horrified by events in Israel and Gaza. David Ward debases them and shames his party.’ Labour simply described Mr Ward’s comments as ‘vile’. Mr Ward’s comments are reminiscent of those made by the former Lib Dem peer Jenny Tonge a decade ago. Baroness Tonge was forced to resign as the party’s children’s spokesman after saying of Palestinian suicide bombers: ‘If I had to live in that situation – and I say that advisedly – I might just consider becoming one myself.’ Conservative Grant Shapps (left) branded Mr Ward's comments 'appalling' and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg (right) launched an investigation which could see Mr Ward kicked out of the party Mr Ward's apology was issues after after the Board of Deputies of British Jews called on Mr Clegg to withdraw the party whip from the MP, whose membership was suspended for a period following previous controversial remarks about Israel and the Jews. The Board of Deputies said he had 'shamed Parliament, the Liberal Democrats and himself'. Last year he was disciplined by Nick Clegg for ‘unacceptable’ comments in which he accused ‘the Jews’ of atrocities against Palestinians in a message posted just before Holocaust Memorial Day.

The 32-year-old, who was a foreign national living in Ireland, underwent an abortion at a Marie Stopes clinic in west London in January 2012. She died in a taxi hours after the procedure. Marie Stopes International declined to comment because of client confidentiality. An inquest is yet to be held but the Metropolitan Police said a file on the woman's death had been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service in April this year. Investigation: A 32-year-old pregnant woman who flew from Ireland to Britain to undergo an abortion at a Marie Stopes clinic in west London, stock image pictured, died just hours after the procedure The Met continue to investigate the sudden death, a spokesman said. The woman's husband told The Irish Times that his wife had sought an abortion at a maternity hospital in Dublin but had been told that it was not legally possible to provide one. New legislation allowing for a termination in Irish hospitals when a woman's life is in danger are expected to be formally signed into laws in coming days. It is understood the woman's life was not considered to be at risk when she sought the procedure although she had a condition which raised the risk of miscarriage. The woman's husband, who wishes to remain anonymous, said he is frustrated at the lack of progress in the investigation. 'I think if this was an Irish or a British woman, we would know what happened to her. But I am still waiting for answers,' he said. Death: Savita Halappanavar died in hospital in Ireland last year from suspected septicaemia after doctors refused to terminate her pregnancy The woman had a child in Ireland in 2010. Her pregnancy was painful and complicated by extensive fibroids and treatment could have left her her infertile. 'We were worried about what would happen when she became pregnant again,' he said. 'She was sick, but we were told that nothing could be done in Ireland.' It is understood the woman was about 20 weeks pregnant when she travelled to Britain for an abortion. Her husband told the newspaper that she may have acted sooner but was examining options and raising money for the procedure. It is understood the woman was suddenly taken ill in the Slough area of Berkshire at about midnight on the day of the procedure while in a taxi. She was pronounced dead at Wexham Park Hospital after suffering a heart attack caused by extensive internal blood loss. The couple were in Ireland on student visas at the time of her death. Ireland has since amended the law to allow abortions in the country in certain circumstances after a backlash following the death of Indian dentist Savita Halappanavar, who died in an Irish hospital last year after being denied an abortion. She was miscarrying 17 weeks into her pregnancy in October but doctors would not terminate the pregnancy. Her widower Praveen claimed the couple had been told a termination was not allowed because 'Ireland is a Catholic country', prompting a worldwide outcry. The bill was passed earlier this month after it was revealed that 11 women travelled from Ireland to Britain every day for an abortion last year. Her husband Praveen Halappanavar (seen together on their wedding day) said they were told she could not have an abortion because 'Ireland is a Catholic country'"

Harry Burkhart, 24, may have been motivated to set the fires by his mother's arrest, according to officials and CNN affiliates. His mother, 53-year-old Dorothee Burkhart, was arrested by Los Angeles police during a traffic stop on December 28, a day before the first of 52 fires, mostly in parked cars, that investigators suspect were part of a series of arsons. The son, who was arrested Monday, was charged with one count of arson of an inhabited dwelling. He is likely to face additional charges as the investigation moves forward, said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Harry Burkhart remains jailed without bail and is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. ""What did you do to my son,"" Dorothee Burkhart, yelled at the judge during her hearing Tuesday. ""My son is disappeared since yesterday. Perhaps the German Nazis know of our address."" It did not appear that she knew her son had been arrested a day earlier on the arson charge. She turned down an offer of a court-appointed lawyer and was given until her next hearing Friday to hire a defense attorney. A federal extradition complaint said she is wanted in Germany on 19 counts of fraud, including an allegation that she defrauded the doctor who performed breast augmentation surgery on her in 2004. The other fraud charges center on rent and security deposits for apartments in Frankfurt, Germany, the complaint said. A website advertising ""sensual tantra massage"" and offering ""full body hot oil body to body sliding massage"" is registered to Dorothee Burkhart using a Hollywood address, according to a domain registry database. She lived with her son in a Hollywood apartment, according to the complaint. Investigators seized press clippings of arson attacks in Germany from the apartment, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Dorothee Burkhart last entered the United States lawfully in January 2007 and left the country four months later, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She currently has no lawful immigration status and ICE has lodged an immigration detainer against her, it said. A court document released earlier on Tuesday incorrectly stated that Dorothee Burkhart had most recently entered the United States in October, according to ICE. Harry Burkhart was in the United States lawfully at the time of his arrest on a non-immigrant visa, which expires on January 18, ICE said. The agency has similarly lodged an immigration detainer against him. Arson investigators counted 52 fires, most starting in parked cars, since Friday morning, but none since the suspect was detained at 3 a.m. Monday, according to officials. No one was hurt in the fires, but property damage is likely to reach $3 million, said Los Angeles Fire Chief Brian Cummings. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday that after Los Angeles police released a surveillance video of a man seen near the scene of one fire, agents in the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security field office recognized Burkhart. Multiple CNN affiliates reported the alleged arson spree could have stemmed from a deportation battle between the suspect and immigration officials involving Burkhart's mother. After his arrest, Burkhart told investigators, ""I hate America,"" according to CNN affiliate KABC. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said officials believe -- and hope -- the fires were set by one person. But they will proceed as though others may be involved until they know for sure, Beck said. ""I feel very good that we've got the right guy. (The suspect) had the right stuff in his van, and we are confident in the arrest,"" Beck said. Neighbor Galina Larimoda told KABC-TV through a Russian translator that Harry Burkhart knocked on her door Sunday and seemed angry and not ""completely normal."" Los Angeles County Reserve Sheriff's Deputy Shervin Lalezary, who draws a salary of $1 a year, was hailed as a hero for arresting Burkhart. Lalezary, an Iranian-born lawyer who moonlights as a deputy, pulled over a van in Hollywood driven by a man who resembled the person seen on the surveillance video. With the help of backup officers, he then arrested the driver, Burkhart. CNN's Chuck Conder, Alan Duke, Paul Vercammen, Mike Ahlers, Ashley Hayes, Lateef Mungin, and Irving Last contributed to this report."

Last weekend's box-office champ ""2012"" primarily uses an ancient Mayan prophecy to spin a tale of world destruction. ""The Road,"" due out November 25, showcases a father and son navigating a post-apocalyptic world of ash, cold and cannibals. And the indie documentary ""Collapse"" gives voice to one man's belief that, as we exhaust natural resources, civilization is ready to crumble. Such concerns have always been with us, says Alexander Riley, a sociology professor at Bucknell University who's incorporated eschatology (the study of the end times) into his courses. ""It's been a constant part of the landscape in the Western world for a long time,"" he says, though it's been particularly present in recent times, perhaps driven by ever-quickening social and technological change, he adds. Examples can be found through the centuries. At the end of the year 999, pilgrims made their way to Jerusalem, convinced that the Last Judgment was at hand. In 1843, thousands of followers of the religious leader William Miller gathered on New England hilltops, waiting for ascension. In 1982, some believed the ""Jupiter Effect"" -- the rough alignment of several celestial bodies -- would cause catastrophe. And the coming of the year 2000 led to fears about technological collapse -- in the form of the Y2K bug -- and rumblings about the return of Jesus. The fact that none of these events led to the end of the world hasn't calmed end-times fears. Indeed, many people are still trying to interpret alleged prophecies -- such as the biblical Book of Revelation, Nostradamus' verses and that 2012-focused Mayan Long Count calendar -- in hopes of figuring out exactly when the other shoe will drop, and humanity will be freed from its vale of tears. Riley observes that end-times passions find particularly fertile soil in the United States, which has a higher degree of religiosity compared to other developed nations, according to a 2008 Gallup survey. At the evangelical Friends Church in Yorba Linda, California -- one of the largest Quaker churches in the world -- Phil Hotsenpiller, the church's teaching pastor, gives a yearly series of lectures on end-times concepts and says interest has been high, with ""lines out the door."" He says that he tries to educate his audience about the sources of apocalyptic thought, and why biblical prophecy is such a draw for some. ""Biblical prophecy lays out a scenario that God says this is what's going to happen, and just watch for these signs,"" he says. The movie business has taken notice: The Weinstein Company, producers of ""The Road,"" asked Hotsenpiller to take his show on, well, the road to discuss themes of the film. But it's not just Christian groups that have an end-times fascination. Riley says that all the major monotheistic faiths -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- have variations on the belief that God interacts directly with humanity, and has made a promise ""to wrap things up, and then we'll get on with Act Two."" That idea of an Act Two -- or, better yet, a conclusion -- satisfies something innate in humans, he says. ""Lots of people have an interest in cultural narratives ... that have a closure that coincides to some degree with their own lives,"" Riley says. Science provides a story as well, he says, ""but it's very open-ended."" The eschatological narrative, on the other hand, says ""the world is going to come to an end, and it's likely going to come to an end in my lifetime. So conveniently, everything is going to wrap up when or before MY life wraps up."" Which is where Hollywood, longtime manufacturer of great stories and seeker of customer satisfaction, comes in. iReporter: See ""2012"" in theatres Movie history is replete with end-of-the-world scenarios, whether driven by religion (""The Seventh Sign""), alien invasion (""Mars Attacks!""), environmental disaster (""The Day After Tomorrow""), warfare (""Dr. Strangelove"") or much of the above (""Beneath the Planet of the Apes""). Wheeler Winston Dixon, Ryan Professor of Film Studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, points out that the topic is almost as old as film itself: The first sound film of Abel Gance, who made the groundbreaking 1927 silent ""Napoleon,"" was 1931's ""The End of the World,"" in which a comet slams into Earth. (It flopped.) Such films allow us to enjoy the present while watching a fantasy about the future, he says. ""I think it's a desire to sort of say ... 'We won't have to worry about the future, because there is no future,' "" he says. ""And so therefore, we can do what we want now, and all the debts are put off and all the responsibilities are avoided."" Besides, ""the complete destruction of the world has always been attractive, because ... by witnessing that act and staying outside of it, you've witnessed the apocalypse,"" he says. ""It's much like a horror movie. It allows you to participate without risk."" ""We love adrenaline,"" adds Peter Hankoff, a writer-producer of documentaries for the National Geographic Channel and the Discovery Channel, among others. ""We always have this need to be vigilant or hypervigilant. So when something like this comes on our radar of the possibility of the end, it peaks our adrenaline level. ... We love disaster, and we love to avert it."" But Hankoff, a pleasurably acerbic skeptic who has made documentaries about Nostradamus, says it's hard to persuade people invested in end-times theories to revise their views. ""The problem is, when you're faced with the facts, and faced with finding real concrete proof ... 2 plus 2 equals 4, no matter how many times you add it up."" Believing in the end offers power to the dispossessed, he adds: ""[If] there's this level of feeling of insignificance, what's the greatest equalizer in the world? The end of the world."" iReporter: ""2012"" good, not great Sometimes, the fixation can lead to tragedy. In 1995, members of the Japanese group Aum Shinrikyo released sarin nerve gas into the Tokyo subway system, killing 12 people. Two years later, members of the Heaven's Gate cult committed suicide in the belief that a spaceship was going to come and take them off earth. And many terrorists and agitators subscribe to end-times beliefs, with hope that their provocations can lead to apocalypse. Still, as optimists are fond of pointing out, ""apocalypse"" doesn't mean end, but is Greek for ""revelation"" -- an unveiling of truth. In that respect, says Hotsenpiller, a concern about the end can lead to a desire to fix things: hope that we, as humans, can make a positive impact. ""All of us deep down know that something's wrong with the world and with us as people,"" he says. ""There is something wired into us, or placed in there by God, that says, 'Every one of you is going to have to deal with the issues that ... aren't right in your life.' That doesn't have to be a negative. It can be a positive. It can be where I come to grips with who I am as a person, with who I am before God, and I make some changes."" And for those who are still convinced that 2012 means the collapse of civilization, Hankoff -- who doesn't buy it for a minute (though he can't wait to see the movie) -- is pleased to offer a solution. ""I want everybody that believes that 2012 is going to happen to send me their stuff,"" he says. ""And if you get mad at me for saying that 2012 is totally insane, you can send me an apology on December 22, 2012 -- which is a Saturday, by the way -- because I'm still going to be here."""

Surgeons are being increasingly called on to transplant hair from the heads of  women, to their pubic region. The latest figures show the number of pubic hair transplants in Asia has increased since 2006. Between 2010 and 2012 alone, there was 78 per cent increase in pubic hair transplants in this geographical area, according to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS). Rising numbers of Korean women are undergoing a procedure to have hair from their head transplanted into their pubic region, to combat a condition which leaves them with insufficient pubic hair The condition, called pubic atrichosis or hypotrichosis, causes otherwise healthy women to lack pubic hair. It is particularly common in Korean women of Mongolian origin, according to a report published in the journal of Dermatologic Surgery. Meanwhile one Korean clinic estimates that 10 per cent of women in the country have pubic atrichosis, according to the blog Refinery29. As pubic hair is seen as a sign of sexual health and fertility, many women suffer from psychological stress. Surgery is the only solution to the condition. ISHRS figures from 2011 show that Asia conducted the largest amount of eyelash, eyebrow and pubic area hair restorations worldwide. And yearly figures show that in 2012, there were 576 pubic hair transplant operations in Asia, up from 324 in 2010. The hair transplantation procedure starts at $2,000 and involves doctors taking hair from the head and inserting it into the pubic region, by inserting bulbs into the women's skin. The procedure takes two to four hours, but it may take a few sessions for the hair to take root. After the hair transplant, women can grow their hair into a new shape, such as a, fan or diamond. Writing on the website, a spokesperson from the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery said: 'While loss of scalp hair is more likely to concern East Asian men, some East Asian women and/or their husbands are concerned by the loss of female pubic hair. 'Loss of pubic hair, or failure to grow pubic hair, is somewhat more common in East Asian women than in women of other ancestry. 'Transplants of pubic hair may be considered as a procedure to help an East Asian woman recover satisfactory self-esteem.' Women who shave their bikini lines risk complications such as infections, burns, severe itching, rashes or cuts, a study has warned. U.S. researchers found that 87 per cent of women currently remove all or some of their pubic hair, with the majority using a razor, while the rest admitted to getting a bikini wax at least once in their life. Almost two thirds (60 per cent) of the women also reported experiencing at least one health-related complication, which also included invisible cuts to the skin called epidermal abrasions, ingrown hairs, bruises or allergies. Overweight and obese women were found to be twice as likely to experience a complication than their slimmer counterparts and three times more likely if they removed all of their pubic hair rather than just some of it."

The six-year-old was stunned when he received a letter from a girl called Millie, telling him that she had found his balloon in her back garden in New South Wales. The balloon had made it a staggering 10,545 miles from Derby to Millie's home in East Kurrajon, around 50 miles from Sydney. Airmail: Joshua Blackaby was amazed when he received a letter telling him that a balloon he released as part of a school project had been found in Australia Epic adventure: Joshua's balloon travelled 10,545 miles from Alvaston, Derby to East Kurrajon in New South Wales, Australia Pupils at the Wyndham Primary Academy in Alvaston, Derby, launched the 300 tagged balloons in December last year and although some of his friends' efforts made it to Denmark and The Netherlands - no one could match Joshua's efforts. 'We thought that was amazing,' said home school co-ordinator Suzannah Hemmings. 'However, on our return from the February half-term holiday, a letter arrived from Australia addressed to one of our pupils, Joshua Blackaby. 'With great excitement he opened it in front of his class to reveal the balloon tag and a letter from a little girl called Millie who had found the balloon and tag in a tree in her garden in East Kurrajong, about 50 miles from Sydney in New South Wales.' Safe return: Joshua's new penpal Millie wrote to say she had found the balloon and returned it along with his tag The school had been using the balloon's flight to give pupils a greater understanding of geography and the weather. Ms Hemmings said that the school was now considering asking a weather expert to work out how the balloon had made it so far. 'The children are looking into the possible flight the balloon would have taken and writing stories about the adventures and sights and sounds on its journey,' she said. 'We are looking at getting an expert in on weather patterns and wind direction to give an indication of how the balloon would have travelled to Sydney.' Millie's letter, which she signed, was written by an adult and said: 'Hi. My name is Millie and I found your balloon in a tree in my back garden. I am very excited and pleased to send it back.' Joshua said that he would be writing back to his new Australian friend. He said: 'I can't believe the balloon went all that way. I am looking forward to writing back to the girl.' Amazed: Joshua's mum Coleen said she was 'gobsmacked when she found out how far the balloon had travelled Joshua's mother Coleen Blackaby, 28, said: 'I was very amazed. I was just gobsmacked when I found out it had made it to Australia. 'Joshua was surprised when the letter came to school on Monday. It was just a normal helium balloon.' There have been cases of balloons from the UK being found in Hong Kong. Charlie Powell from the Met Office, was amazed that the balloon had travelled so far, but said that such events were not unheard of. 'There is no reason why the balloon shouldn't be swept up into a low part of the jet stream,' he said. 'There are two jet streams in each hemisphere and they wobble their way around the world, travelling at hundreds of miles an hour. 'It is possible that this could happen but the chances are very low.''"

I've tackled quite a few mountains in my life, but never have I hiked with as many solemn spirits as on Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka. Barefoot pilgrims are all around me. There are women, whose bangles can be heard rattling against tired ankles, and monks, pulling their maroon robes over their left shoulders to shield from the mountain chill. We're all going up silently toward the summit of what is a holy mountain for Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians in Sri Lanka. The 2,243-meter (7,359 feet) Adam's Peak lies among the island nation's southern Central Highlands, 150 kilometers (93 miles) east of the capital Colombo. It's one of Sri Lanka's highest mountains, rising like a green fang from a carpet of dense forest reserve where wild elephants and leopards still dwell. It isn't the scenery or wildlife that daily pulls in thousands of pilgrims though. All of them are here to see a 1.8-meter-long rock formation that juts out from the summit. Tough going To Buddhists, Sri Pada, or the sacred footprint, is an imprint left by the Buddha himself. Hindus say it belonged to Shiva while Christians and Muslims consider it a sign of Adam's passage. Local legend has it that Sri Lanka's King Valagambahu was the first to stumble upon Sri Pada during a reign that ended in about 76 BC. The peak gets another historic name check from none other than Marco Polo, who visited in the 14th century, reporting that his ascent was tough going. Today, a stone staircase helps almost every Sri Lankan tackle the peak several times during their lives. From December to May, the mountain glows nightly as torchlit pilgrims follow the trail to the top. Some climb in the afternoon to reach the shrine at sundown but the most popular and spiritual time to ascend is the middle of the night, summiting just in time to catch the first rays of dawn. Just getting to Adam's Peak is an act of devotion. Pure pilgrimage After traveling from the central city town of Kandy to Hatton on a slow train through the relentless greenery of the area's Ceylonese tea estates, I catch a rickety bus to continue my journey. My destination is Dalhousie, a cluster of chai stalls, home stays and informal restaurants that marks the starting point of the five-kilometer Nallathanni climbing route, the shortest way to the summit. The basic facilities on offer are attuned to the reasons for the climb. This isn't a leisure pursuit, but a pure pilgrimage. My ascent begins at a chilly 3 a.m. The climb can take between two and a half and four hours -- I'm aiming to summit at the break of dawn at 6.30 a.m. Groups of pilgrims dressed in white lead me through the dark and to the beginning of the incline. ""Each time feels like the first,"" says Saman, a slender man from a village near Bentota on Sri Lanka's southern coast. He and his wife are tackling their fifth climb, accompanying their six-year-old son for his first ascent. Before the path starts rising, a monk from the nearby Japanese temple comes forward and in exchange for an offering, ties a white string around my waist as a form of blessing. And so, with the eyes of one of Sri Pada's benevolent gods hopefully on me, I proceed upward as the incline slowly turns into a stone staircase. Spiritual awakening? Along the way, vendors cook pans of soothing chai over portable gas stoves. Prices, like the sacred mountain, are steep. The peak comes into view a couple hours into the climb. Many hikers greet it with determined expressions, their only goal to arrive at Sri Pada before sunrise. As we get nearer, the darkness disperses in tones of blue. Just before dawn throws shards of burning red across the sky, we sail into a sea of pilgrims surrounding the shrine's platform. It's quite a sight. Pilgrims walk in circles reciting mantras, queuing up to pray before the sacred footprint. On the edge of the slope, young monks in wool hats hold their robes tight under their chins with chilled fingers, waiting for the sun's rays to bring the new day. With the sound of tolling bells at my back, I join the line and watch first light over central Sri Lanka. The spectacle is enough to stop my legs from aching and make me forget that I must, at some point, return to Earth. Getting there Two daily trains leave from Kandy to Hatton. Number 1005 departs at 8:47 a.m. and arrives at 11:12 a.m. while number 1015 leaves at 11:10 a.m. and arrives at 13:26 p.m. Buses run to Dalhousie from Hatton's train station until early afternoon. During pilgrimage season (December to May), there are direct buses to Dalhousie from Colombo, Kandy and Nuwara Eliya. However, the scenic train route across the Hill Country is highly recommended."

Over the past week, security researchers have spotted at least two ‘tag campaigns’ that were able to infect around 55,000 users a day. The scams work by tagging no more than 20 friends of the victim in a malicious post designed to lure the friends into clicking a link or watching a video. Scroll down for video Over the past week, security researchers have spotted at least two ‘tag campaigns’ which have infected more than 115,000 users.The scam works by tagging no more than 20 friends of the victim in a malicious post designed to lure people into clicking a link or watching a video (pictured) Romania-based threat analyst Bogdan Botezatu, from security firm Bitdefender, reported on the first scam on 26 January. In a blog post, Mr Botezatu said: ‘The scam starts with an alleged video in which a number of friends are tagged in. 'The number of tagged friends is always 20 but the alleged video is always different.' The scam starts with an alleged video that is posted with 20 friends tagged. The number of tagged friends is always 20 but the alleged video is always different. Typically, the so-called video shows the goo.gl host underneath. This is a URL shortening service and not a video hosting site. After a victim clicks on this particular link, they are prompted to update Adobe Flash Player, at which point the hacker can take control of a device and install other malicious files and viruses designed to steal personal information. Once infected, the victim inadvertently posts the link to their own newsfeed, tagging another 20 people. Users are being warned to be wary of clicking on links they are tagged in, and are encouraged to check with friends who have posted the link to check its safety. Antivirus software will also detect malicious files and installations. The  video shows the goo.gl host underneath, which Mr Botezatu said should raise some flags with more experienced users, as it is a URL shortening service and not a video hosting site. After a victim clicks on this particular link, they are prompted to update Adobe Flash Player, at which point the hacker can take control of a device and install other malicious files and viruses designed to steal personal information. This could include accessing personal files to steal photos, or logging what keys are typed to steal login details and passwords. Once infected, the victim inadvertently posts the link to their own Facebook newsfeed, tagging another 20 people, and so on. Another scam, also spotted by Mr Botezatu targeted Spanish speakers specifically, but had the same outcome. In just one hour, this scam infected more than 5,000 users. At the weekend, security expert Mohammad Reza Faghani additionally posted details of a tagging Trojan. He wrote: ‘The trojan tags the infected user's friends in an enticing post. 'Upon opening the post, the user will get a preview of a porn video which eventually stops and asks for downloading a (fake) Flash Player to continue the preview.' During two days of monitoring, Mr Faghani found the malware infected more than 110,000 users and was rising. He said that by only tagging 20 people each time, the malware is able to keep a relatively low profile, but has the potential to reach more people because friends of friends can see tagged posts, depending on a person’s privacy settings. After a victim clicks on a particular link, they are prompted to update Adobe Flash Player, at which point the hacker can take control of a device and install other malicious files. Once infected, the victim inadvertently posts the link to their own Facebook newsfeed, tagging another 20 people, and so on This scam has been dubbed ‘Magnet’ because it attracts and lures people to it. Mr Faghani explained that the malware even has the potential to take over a person’s mouse and keyboard, in addition to their operating system. Users are being warned to be wary of clicking on links they are tagged in, and are encouraged to check with friends who have posted the link to check its safety. Antivirus software will also detect malicious files and installations."

But if they did, it’s not unreasonable to imagine that they might say ‘don’t poke with a stick’. One elderly crocodile farm owner in South Africa found out just what can happen when you do poke one of the prehistoric reptiles with a bit of wood – you put your toes, if not your life, in danger. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO The crocodile is clearly not happy with Mr Watson's attempts to move her with a big stick Now truly fed up, the crocodile lunges forward Earth Touch News ""Croc Attack"" Peter Watson, who runs Crocodile Creek in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, was lucky to survive after he used a stick to try and move a mother crocodile away from her eggs, which were about to hatch. The 73-year-olds' attempts to coax the three-metre-long animal to another part of her enclosure were caught on camera by Earth Touch News Network, who happened to be at the farm filming. Their dramatic footage shows him prodding the huge croc - and the croc snapping angrily back at him. Suddenly, the crocodile lunges forward and grabs his foot, sending Mr Watson tumbling to the ground and scrambling for his life. The angry mother crocodile snaps down on Mr Watson's foot and sends him sprawling to the ground Mr Watson was lucky to escape with his life and later explained that the beast had shaken him 'like a leaf' Miraculously, he escaped relatively unscathed. He did lose a toe nail, though. He told iOL News: ‘It shook me like a flippin leaf. It got a hold of my foot and started shaking me. I had already reasoned it would bite me again so I held out my arms. 'I had to protect my stomach and my throat… that could be fatal because it could tear my stomach out. I’m amazed my toe stayed on.’ He added: ‘My wife is bloody annoyed, if you get bitten around here, you get no sympathy.’ Crocodile Creek is home to around 7,000 crocodiles and snakes."

Another 12 homes had been damaged, and 300 homes and 60 business were threatened, according to a report from state emergency officials. The heavy winds -- sustained at about 40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph -- were making it hard for helicopters and other firefighting vehicles to battle the blaze, Kearney said. Further complicating matters were three other smaller fires, about 100 acres each, elsewhere in the state that had already stretched emergency resources.

But for these fearless surfers it provides the perfect destination for monster waves. The daredevils braved the chilly conditions in the crystal clear water as they enjoyed the powerful swells off the Lofoten Islands, in Norway. Surfers Dane Gudauskas, Alex Parker and Keith Malloy normally carve up the golden beaches of sunny California but made the trip to the Arctic, where temperatures as low as just 2-3C, after hearing about the smooth waves.

He's wearing a thick wetsuit, hood, gloves and shoes to prevent pneumonia After putting his wetsuit on, surfer Mr Gudauskas , 26, walked the ice-covered road to the beach through snow as high as his waist - all just to reach the water's edge. They wear full wetsuits with shoes and hoods covering as much of their skin as possible. But Mr Gudauskas said that once the water hit his face it felt 'like fire'. They have to warm up before entering the water - and they contend with the risk of catching pneumonia. Breathtaking: One of the surfers performs a grab after getting some air on one of the less threatening of the Arctic waves. Behind him the stunning scenery makes for an impressive picture Golden sun rays light up the sky, but the temperatures in the water and air are still dangerously low. The men had to take extra precautions to prevent them from catching pneumonia Mr Gudauskas said: 'When the water hit any exposed skin it would burn like fire until your body temperature warmed up from paddling. Only then could you get the mojo working. 'The region is pretty cold I'd imagine by any standard. The air was ranging from 2C to way lower depending on the day and wind chill. 'Winds were very strong through the valley and felt like they could cut you in half - it must have been minus degrees fairly often and the water was probably 2-3C.

They have to walk across rocky shores to reach the remote waves It's a bit fresh out there: The clean powerful swells are rarely surfed in winter, when most people consider the water too cold to venture in to 'It's a really strange sensation entering water that cold. We're wearing wetsuits between 5-7mm so the only parts that really feel the cold when you first enter is any exposed skin so mostly just your face. 'I remember it felt like fire - an insane sensation and very uncomfortable. If you had to duck under consecutive waves you would get a crazy headache and it felt like my eye sockets were physically swelling to the point I thought they might swell my eyes shut. 'I don't think it's too dangerous unless you don't warm up. Although pneumonia would be pretty easy to get if you don't know what you're doing and that can be serious.

We were there a week and a half and the weather spanned from full snow white-outs, to melting snow on the hills, then right as we were leaving we could barely drive from the house as a blizzard nearly snowed us in. 'I've been surfing relatively my whole life - I was always around the ocean and it has been a natural progression. 'But this was extremely different from what we're used to here in California, mainly just the harsh conditions but I loved it and every part of it.

The conditions looked 'punishing' said the photographer 'I've never done anything like it before, in fact I think it had been almost 10 years since I had seen snow but I relished the experience and the challenges that surfing in the snow presented.' Most surfers tackle the cool waves in spring - as the Arctic Circle emerges from its dark winter during the time the snow is melting and the ocean calms down. But Dane and the team went over during wild winter chaos most people would describe as unsurfable and conquered even the most powerful of waves. The trip was the brainchild of photographer Chris Burkard, 26, who had an aching desire to go somewhere that would be freezing in the winter time Should I go in?

Reaching the beach across the rocky shore was one of the biggest challenges He said: 'I've seen it in the summer but in the winter it looked punishing. We wanted to see if it could be done and the weather was worse than we ever imagined. 'It was so difficult with rain building up on my camera. I tried to go swimming but I could feel my vital organs shutting down and all my blood rushing to my heart to protect it. 'I swam a couple of days but they were in the water every day. Luckily they're on their boards above the water most of the time but I think they might have started to get used to it. 'I had to wear thinner gloves to handle the camera so it was almost unbearable. I would get back to the car and simply couldn't move. It was a cool but brutal experience.'"

For the first time, the US-style electronic tags – which have been worn by the likes of Lindsay Lohan – are to be handed out by UK courts to binge drinkers in lieu of jail. Those guilty of drunken offences such as assault, criminal damage, drink-driving or brawling in the street will be ordered to wear the ankle devices around the clock. Tagged: Actress Lindsay Lohan with an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet Every 30 minutes, they test the subject’s sweat to see if it contains alcohol. If a trace is found, an alert is sent to the offender’s probation officer. They can then be recalled to court, where they may be fined or even jailed. It builds on a similar scheme in the US that saw actress Miss Lohan forced to wear a tag after she failed to show up for a probation hearing relating to a 2007 drink-driving case. Yesterday a 24-year-old thug who provoked a fight outside a nightclub while drunk became the first in the UK to be issued with a bracelet. Augustine Apraku, of Sutton, South London, was ordered to wear the tag for 80 days after pleading guilty at Croydon Magistrates’ Court to using abusive language and provoking unlawful violence. He is the first of 150 offenders to be issued with bracelets in four London boroughs – Croydon, Lambeth, Southwark and Sutton – where the pilot scheme is running. Magistrates can order offenders to wear the tags for up to four months. If an offender manages 120 days without drinking, they will receive no further punishment for their original crime beyond a police caution. Boris Johnson launched the scheme yesterday, saying he wanted to target those ‘getting a bit too tanked up on a Friday night’ and causing problems. The London Mayor added: ‘Rather than lock them up we can help them to beat it by putting this ankle sniffing device on … I think it’s a cheaper, more effective way to help people to beat the booze and to beat violence.’ He said the scheme was aimed at those who have committed a crime while drunk, but who are not alcohol dependent. Offenders will be required to be at home at certain times of the day – usually twice – so a base station can get readings from the tag and transmit them to a monitoring centre. If no readings are received for two days, the supervising probation officer will be notified for further investigation. The policy has the backing of David Cameron, who first suggested the bracelets in 2012."

Manchester United's Ashley Young and Arsenal's Theo Walcott were taunted with monkey noises and Nazi salutes during England's victory in Sofia last night. The chants could be heard when Young was substituted and Walcott was targeted when he missed a chance late in the Euro qualifier. Vile: One Bulgarian supporter gives a Nazi salute during the game against England in Sofia Hateful message: Bulgarian fans unfurl an abusive banner as a supporter gives a Nazi salute FA officials reported the behaviour to the UEFA match delegate after the game which saw home supporters unfurl a banner which said 'F*** UEFA'. England's two-goal match winner Wayne Rooney slammed the Bulgarian fans' behaviour. He said: 'We could hear it on the pitch. It has been going on for years.and it's not right. 'It needs to stop and hopefully something will be done about it.' Walcott told Mail Sport: 'It was very clear. I ignored it. I think the FA will deal with that and I don't want to comment too much. The result was the important thing.' Fiery salute : Bulgarian soccer supporters light up a flare in Sofia Abused: England's Ashley Young in action last night in Sofia against Bulgaria England captain John Terry had not heard the abuse during the game, but told Sky TV:  'You don't expect that at all. It was a great spectacle for everyone to watch let's not let that spoil it.' Apology: Lothar Matthaus said sorry for the behaviour of Bulgarian fans Bulgaria boss Lothar Matthaus, a former German World Cup winner, apologised for the conduct of the minority of his team's fans. Like Terry before him, he admitted to being 'not very informed' about what had occurred, having been focused on the match. But he added: 'It is very pitiful for such things to happen. Because of that I would like to apologise on behalf of the Bulgarian Football Federation.' England have encountered racism problems on their travels before. Seven years ago Shaun Wright-Phillips and Ashley Cole were targeted by home spectators during a friendly played in Madrid. A spokesman for the FA confirmed: 'We've raised it with the Bulgarian FA and the UEFA delegate after the match. That's all we're saying about it.'"

Sources close to the review, carried out by the Crown Office and Police Scotland, have said there is 'not a shred of evidence' to support suggestions he was wrongly convicted. The Libyan intelligence officer was convicted in 2001 for killing 270 people in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, but more than two decades on, there are lingering suspicions he was a scapegoat used to cover up the involvement of other Middle Eastern countries. Scroll down for video Convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi pictured in bed in 2011 as he was dying of  cancer Here Megrahi is pictured being escorted by security officers through Tripoli in 1992. A new review of the case against him has found there is not a 'shred of evidence' to support conspiracy claims It's also been claimed his imprisonment was a price worth paying by Libya for the lifting of crippling sanctions, imposed for several years after Megrahi was identified in Scotland and the US as the likely bomber. However, sources close to the recent review have told The Times that pursuit of the case in Libya only confirmed the evidence against Megrahi  - and even further implicated Lamin Fhimah, who was originally accused but acquitted. Police claim any planting of evidence to frame Megrahi would needed to have been done within a very short space of time and furthermore, it would require knowledge of all the evidence in the case still to come, the paper reported. Megrahi died two years ago after being controversially released from a Scottish jail in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had terminal prostate cancer. His release, based on the understanding he had only three months to live, caused outrage in the U.S., which lost 189 citizens in the terrorist attack. Relatives in the US said they remained convinced that Megrahi had been freed to appease the Libyan government, smoothing the way for a string of lucrative deals.

I still believe that the Scottish government, perhaps with the participation of the British government, created a major injustice when they let him out.' A year after his death, it was revealed Megrahi's release was linked to a £400million arms deal with Libya. Documents showed 'reprehensible' connections between the Labour government boosting business and freeing the man convicted of Britain’s worst terrorist atrocity. An email sent by the then UK ambassador in Tripoli to former premier Tony Blair explained how a prisoner transfer agreement will be signed once Libya 'fulfils its promise' to buy an air defence system."

Hanna's path and strength remain uncertain, but the latest forecast map from the National Hurricane Center predicts it still could make landfall as a major hurricane on the southeastern U.S. coast by Friday evening. Hanna's path early Tuesday appeared to be a ""meandering"" loop across Turks and Caicos, but atmospheric changes over the western Atlantic are expected to steer the storm northwestward over the next two or three days, according to forecasters. As of 5 a.m. ET, Hanna was a Category 1 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with sustained winds of 80 mph (129 kph) and gusts of up to 100 mph. iReport.com: Watch Hanna lash Turks and Caicos Islands Three hours later, it was downgraded to a tropical storm as winds fell below the 74 mph threshold for hurricane status. It could return to hurricane status later Tuesday or on Wednesday, forecasters said. Hanna's line of fire could include the U.S. Atlantic coast from Miami, Florida, to Massachusetts, according to the hurricane center's long-range forecast map. Charleston, South Carolina, appears in the middle of this ""cone of uncertainty,"" with Hanna potentially making landfall there Friday. ""It appears that the center has been meandering,"" forecasters said. The history of hurricanes that have been where Hanna is now might argue against its heading toward the southeastern United States. None of the September storms that passed within 200 miles of Hanna's current location has gone there, with most heading into the Gulf of Mexico and others going to New England or Nova Scotia. Still, forecasters said, ""the model guidance is remarkably well clustered"" in support of its forecast path for Hanna.

The officers are accused of using the cruel game of chance while interrogating people thought to be drug traffickers. A photograph of the wheel obtained by the Commission on Human Rights shows a variety of punishments occupying different amounts of space on the wheel. 'Wheel of torture': This photograph shows a wheel allegedly used to decide cruel punishments for suspected criminals Victims claimed they have been beaten up, electrocuted and hit by steel bars and baseball bats in the course of the officers' abuse. One said police pointed a gun at him, while another accused them of threatening his relatives. One of the sections of the wheel is labelled '20 seconds Manny Pacman' - the nickname of Manny Pacquiao, a famous Filipino boxer. If the wheel landed there, detainees were punched by officers. Other spaces are marked with the words 'zombies' and 'duck walk', though it is unclear what the punishments entail. A police spokesman said that several officers have been suspended while the practice is investigated. But Amnesty international, which brought the existence of the wheel to light, has said the police's 'despicable' and 'abhorrent' actions require the officers to be tried as criminals. The Philippines has a history of torture and rights abuses left over from when it was ruled by brutal dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Thousands of his regime's victims won a law suit against the former leader's estate in 1992. Punching punishment: One section of the wheel is named in honour of Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao, right Current president Benigno Aquino III, son of leaders who fought Marcos, has pledged to prosecute violators of human rights, though campaigners say this has done nothing to stop abuses. The 'wheel of torture' is allegedly stationed at a police building in Binan town, in a province south of the capital Manila. According to the Human Rights Commission, the building is not an official detention centre, and was holding prisoners illegally. A spokesman for the commission said they investigated the claims investigated after being tipped off several weeks ago about alleged abuses against more than 40 prisoners. The comission has urged top police officials to pursue criminal complaints against about 10 officers who were implicated in the abuses. Accused: Filipino police officers have been suspended while the allegations and investigated A spokesman for Amnesty International said: 'For police officers to use torture ""for fun"" is despicable.' These are abhorrent acts. Suspending officers is not enough. Errant police personnel and their commanding officers should be held accountable in a court of law.' An anti-torture law in the Philippines was passed in 2009. In 2010, all 11 officers in a Manila police station were relieved of duties after footage emerged of them allegedly hitting a naked robbery suspect. The video showed the suspect screaming on the floor as a man pulled a string bound around his genitals."

In a press release on Friday, Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) claimed its analysis of world temperatures showed ‘2014 was the warmest year on record’. The claim made headlines around the world, but yesterday it emerged that GISS’s analysis – based on readings from more than 3,000 measuring stations worldwide – is subject to a margin of error. Nasa admits this means it is far from certain that 2014 set a record at all. Yet the Nasa press release failed to mention this, as well as the fact that the alleged ‘record’ amounted to an increase over 2010, the previous ‘warmest year’, of just two-hundredths of a degree – or 0.02C. The margin of error is said by scientists to be approximately 0.1C – several times as much. As a result, GISS’s director Gavin Schmidt has now admitted Nasa thinks the likelihood that 2014 was the warmest year since 1880 is just 38 per cent. However, when asked by this newspaper whether he regretted that the news release did not mention this, he did not respond. Another analysis, from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project, drawn from ten times as many measuring stations as GISS, concluded that if 2014 was a record year, it was by an even tinier amount. Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) claimed its analysis of world temperatures showed ‘2014 was the warmest year on record’ Its report said: ‘Numerically, our best estimate for the global temperature of 2014 puts it slightly above (by 0.01C) that of the next warmest year (2010) but by much less than the margin of uncertainty. ‘Therefore it is impossible to conclude from our analysis which of 2014, 2010, or 2005 was actually the warmest year… the Earth’s average temperature for the past decade has changed very little.’ Scientists disagree over its significance, but there is little doubt that the rapid warming of the 1980s and early 1990s has slowed – although greenhouse gas emissions have surged. Bob Ward, of the Grantham Institute on Climate Change, said the new figures showed the notion that global warming had ‘stopped’ was a ‘myth’, although it had ‘temporarily slowed’. Since 1951, he added, the long-term trend was for warming of 0.12C per decade, and in his view, it would ‘pick up again unabated’ if emissions continued to rise. However, if the long-term rate is 0.12C per decade, this would mean the world would be 1C or so warmer by the end of the century, not 4C-5C as some have claimed. Climate sceptics insisted that the new figures showed the warming ‘pause’ had continued. Dr David Whitehouse, of the Global Warming Policy Forum, said ‘there has been no statistically significant warming trend since 1997’ – because the entire increase over this period was smaller than the error margin. Dr Ed Hawkins, associate professor of climate science at the University of Reading, said the past 15 years had seen a slightly slower rate of warming. But he added: ‘You have to take a longer view, because 15 years is too short a period. We expect natural fluctuations, volcanic eruptions and changes in solar output to sometimes slow and sometimes increase warming rates.’ Since 1880, Earth’s average surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius), a trend that is largely driven by the increase in carbon dioxide and other human emissions into the planet’s atmosphere"

The disgraced officer, who works in the 114th Precinct, is currently in jail awaiting formal charges - something which could take state prosecutors up to 21 days. Bail was set at $250,000 and he was suspended by the NYPD early on Tuesday. Two years ago, LeRoy was picked from more than 100 officers in his precinct to win its 'Cop of the Year' award. 'As a member of the anti-crime unit, P.O. Leroy has made more than two dozen arrests so far this year for things like robbery and gun possession,' said then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly about LeRoy.

Dion, 46, must ""focus 100% of her attention on her husband Rene, their family, and associated health issues,"" the statement said. Rene Angelil, 72, underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his throat last December. He stepped aside as his wife's manager in June because of the illness. ""It's been a very difficult and stressful time for the couple as they deal with the day-to-day challenges of fighting this disease while trying to juggle a very active show business schedule, and raise their three young children,"" the statement said. Dion is suffering from ""an illness that has caused inflammation in her throat muscles, and has not been able to perform any of her scheduled shows in Las Vegas since her last show on July 29th,"" the statement said. Dion's shows at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace have been one of the hottest tickets in Las Vegas since she returned to the Strip three years ago. Her residency, which has included about 70 shows a year, is on hold ""until further notice,"" the statement said. ""I want to devote every ounce of my strength and energy to my husband's healing, and to do so, it's important for me to dedicate this time to him and to our children,"" Dion said. ""I also want to apologize to all my fans everywhere, for inconveniencing them, and I thank them so much for their love and support."" Dion and Angelil began a romantic relationship when she was 19 and he was 45. The couple, along with their three sons, live in Las Vegas, where Dion has been performing for three years.

They were called the Promettes and were on hand to give directions, offer medical advice, or just brighten up the day of tourists to the East Sussex seaside town. Now the marketing team at VisitBrighton are looking reinstate a 21st Century equivalent - but this time men can apply too. Scroll down for video Strict entry procedure: In the Fifties, Promettes had to be female and at least 5ft 7in tall The Promettes dressed in sharp-cut uniforms, with white gloves, and black suede shoes The new volunteers will welcome visitors, offering help and advice on where to stay and what to see. They will also provide maps and information on the latest events and attractions. However, the new volunteers will be slightly less elegant than their predecessors - wearing branded polo-shirts and cagoules instead of air hostess style suits and specially designed handbags. The entry standards will also be less stringent thanks to modern equality and employment laws. In the Fifties when sexism was rife, only attractive women could apply and had to be a minimum height of 5ft 7in. The girls posing on one of the rides at the Brighton Pier. They had a strict code of conduct, and although they carried lighters they were not allowed to smoke themselves The launch of the new scheme has been welcomed by former Promettes, who operated out of a caravan at weekends and carried cigarette lighters - but were not allowed to smoke themselves. Audrey Page, from Brighton, was a Promette for the 1956 tourism season having heard about the role while at Vogue Mannequin School. Hazel Legg, now 85, was chief Promette in 1956 and 1957 and said the job was a pleasure She said: 'I think it’s a very good idea to bring them back, although things are a lot different now from how they were then. 'We used to help people with their chairs, posting their cards or if somebody got sunburnt or was not feeling well, telling them where they needed to go. 'Anyone doing it now will have to be quite knowledgeable. I think it will be a more difficult job than it was before. 'They are going to have to be ready for just about anything and carry quite a bit of information with them.' Lorna Whitlock, who Brighton’s chief Promette in 1959, said: 'Every girl wanted to be a Promette. It was like being a mini celebrity. 'We were always being asked out. Guys used to dare each other to ask us out.' Mrs Whitlock said she was paid two guineas for a weekend’s work and combined that with working at the Royal Albion hotel. As well as giving out train times to tourists, the Promettes were also used as hostesses and guides for foreign guests. One of the highlights of her summer was meeting pop star Frankie Vaughan at the Hippodrome. Hazel Legg, 85, from Southwick, West Sussex, was chief Promette in 1956 and 1957. She said: 'It wasn’t hard work, it was pleasurable. We used to get a lot of queries, it was really quite something. 'People would ask us all sorts of things, like what's on at the cinema and we would be up to date with everything that was going on. 'We would also get silly sorts of things like how many pebbles on the beach or what we were doing that night. It is a brilliant idea and just a pity it has not been brought back sooner.' The new volunteer scheme is part of a major shake-up of tourist information in Brighton. The new recruits will be stationed at key locations throughout the city including the Royal Pavilion, the train station, and along the seafront. VisitBrighton said it is looking to 'harness some of London 2012’s sporting spirit' by introducing its own band of on-street volunteers. Recruits will need to commit to a minimum of six months, cover a variety of shifts including weekends, and be able to work for four hours at a time. In return, they will develop new skills with ongoing training, and at the end of their six-month stint will be given a certificate of recognition for their work. Other benefits include free admission to some of the city’s main tourism attractions and invitations to tourism-related openings and events. The Promettes, who operated out of a caravan at weekends, were on hand to give directions, offer medical advice, or just to cheer up visitors Geoffrey Bowden, chairman of the council’s economic development and culture committee, said: 'This is a great opportunity for people to get involved and share their passion for the city with visitors. 'The scheme runs successfully in other cities around the world and worked brilliantly in London during the 2012 Olympics. 'The role of the London Gamesmakers during the London Olympics shows how valuable volunteers can be. The volunteers will have the important role of welcoming visitors and responding to their enquiries.' Late comedian Harry Secombe looks rather pleased to pose between two Promettes. The new volunteers will include men for the first time However unions raised concerns about the use of unpaid volunteers to step in where previously skilled members at the now defunct Visitor Information Centre,  next to the Royal Pavilion, that was closed in September to save money. Alex Knutsen, of Brighton and Hove Unison, said: 'We do have concerns about people doing this on a voluntary basis with no real recompense. 'We wouldn’t want to run down volunteering but it’s better to have skilled paid people with good knowledge of what’s available in the city for all the millions of visitors we have each year. 'With most of that information centre team going, it is a case of cutting off our noses to spite our face. 'We would have preferred to see if the people who benefit from the service, such as hotels, could be asked whether they would contribute to the costs of the centre.' Successful applicants were trained at the Vogue Mannequin School in Hove, East Sussex. Were you a Promette in Brighton? Share your pictures and memories with us by emailing femail@dailymail.co.uk"

The Department of Energy's Blue Ribbon Commission has been given the task of finding an alternative to the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada, which President Obama has vowed to close. The government has spent nearly $10 billion studying the Yucca Mountain location, and the Obama administration estimates that ending the program will save $197 million in 2011. The Obama administration announced in January that the blue-ribbon panel would take a new look at the problem. The panel is headed by former Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton and former Republican National Security adviser Brent Scowcroft.  Read the commission's charter It is highly likely that the 15-member commission will abandon the option to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. It is expected to take 18 months for the commission to conclude its findings, and that isn't sitting well with several lawmakers from states with temporary nuclear waste storage sites. House members Tuesday introduced a bipartisan resolution to block the closure of Yucca Mountain, according to media reports. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Washington, said the resolution calls on the Department of Energy to follow the will of Congress. ""Keeping waste scattered across the country, or in the case of Washington State at Hanford, is no longer an option,"" Inslee said in a statement. ""We have a solution to this problem and we must move forward."" The Hanford facility is one of more than 100 nuclear sites across the country where about 70,000 tons of radioactive waste are stored. An estimated 2,000 tons are added every year.  How federal funds are being used to clean up Hanford After uranium has been used in a reactor, the spent fuel remains radioactive for thousands of years. It is taken out and put into a pool of water, or above ground in canisters made of concrete, steel and lead. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says the canisters are certified for up to 90 years of use, but that term may be extended. Both supporters and opponents of nuclear power largely agree that storing the material in casks at nuclear plants is no long-term solution. If the blue-ribbon commission decides to abandon Yucca Mountain as a nuclear storage facility, there are concerns in southern Nevada over what will be done with the site. ""For years, there's never been a fallback, there's never been a plan B,"" says Michael Voegele, who's been involved with the Yucca Mountain project for decades. Voegele, a consultant with Nevada's Nye County, says it was ""only recently"" that people began to discuss other possible uses for the site. The search for future uses of Yucca only came into question, according to Voegele and others, when the Department of Energy filed a petition to withdraw its Nuclear Regulatory Commission license application for Yucca Mountain earlier this month, effectively killing the project. The Department of Energy filed its petition to withdraw the license application with prejudice, which would prevent it from being refilled. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has fought hard to end the Yucca Mountain project, which is unpopular with many Nevadans.  He has asked the Government Accountability Office to consider alternative uses for the site. Those alternatives include national security activities and renewable energy research. But the closure of the project could have a major economic impact in the region. Gary Hollis, the chairman of the Nye County Board of Commissioners, says closing Yucca Mountain slams the door on 4,000 construction jobs and about 1,500 permanent jobs that would have been created if the site ever got up and running.

But an ambitious railway project is pulling the two continents even closer together with the construction of the world's deepest submerged tunnel. The 76-kilometer (47.2-mile) Marmaray Project will include the world's first submerged railway connection between Europe and Asia, ferrying passengers under a 1.4-km (0.9-m) section of the Bosphorus Strait. However, the massive infrastructure overhaul undertaken by Turkey's Ministry of Transportation has not been without problems. The project started in 2004 and has suffered multiple setbacks due to the region's rich heritage, as Turkey's transport minister Binali Yildirim explains. Infographic: Istanbul and the Bosphorus ""The tunnel is going under a very historical area, [a] historical peninsula where the Ottoman Empire settled ... so every piece of soil is examined by experts, archaeologists."" Yildirim said. At one point during construction, work had to be halted after the discovery of an ancient Byzantine port. ""If [the archaeologists] say you can go, we go. If they stay stop, we stop,"" Yildrim said. All of which has added five years onto the original construction deadline. Watch: Navigating the busy Bosphorus To complicate matters further, the tunnel -- which passes under one of the busiest waterways in the world -- lies in an active earthquake zone. ""There is a big, huge seismic activity risk so we have seismic joints in the tunnels, especially between the immersed tube tunnel and the bore tunnel,"" says deputy project manager, Mehmet Cilingir. The joints between the tunnels are flexible and will protect the structure from seismic movements, Cilingir says. Despite the setbacks, the project is scheduled for completion next year -- a target that will be met, Yildirim says. ""We are very comfortable that the project is going to be complete by the end of next year. 14 million people are just waiting [for this tunnel to open.""] When it does, the tunnel is expected to ease the congested road and ferry routes above carrying 75,000 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times. Train drivers, like Mustafa Berker, are already getting to grips with the new trains that will operate on the line. ""It will be a great joy for me if I too can add a bit to this big project,"" says Berker, a driver with almost four decades experience. ""I'm ready for my retirement but if I can see this through, it will be a great pleasure both for me, my children and grandchildren."""

This finding was based on the knowledge that an Ecuadorian dwarf community is immune to both cancer and diabetes. Researcher was undertaken since it was identified that their cells lack a receptor necessary for a growth hormone to enter. A group of Ecuadorians with Laron syndrome are completely free of diabetes and cancer. The research helped the recent discovery of ways to control cell growth by Australian scientists Professor Mike Waters has been working towards this for 20 years, when he started with the biotechnology company Genentech to clone the receptor. 'People without the receptor don't die from cancer or diabetes,' said the professor who's now the research leader at University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience. Since then Mr Waters has been trying to understand how it works and more importantly, how to switch it on and off. The finding could create a hormone-free method of farming larger seafood such as lobsters The professor and his team explained the process in an article in the journal Science published on Friday. 'We have discovered how growth hormone works at the molecular level,' he said. Research leader Professor Mike Waters of the University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience 'This means we can control the processes of growth. We can stop them. We can start them.' So far it's taken 45 years but the research could lead to a drug that stunts the spread of many forms of cancer. A by-product of the work is a potential hormone-free improvement to fish farming: 'We can put the active receptor into fish or lobster or prawns.' If the receptor is left in the 'on' position, the seafood will grow bigger faster. This is experimental work and has not yet been used commercially or on land animals. In medicine, it could be possible to emulate the cancer immunity of the dwarves, known as Laron dwarfs. This could be done by developing a drug to switch the growth receptor off or remove it completely. So in simple terms - stop the cancer growing and spreading, or kill it. This could also lead to a new class of fine-tuned treatments with limited side effects, according to study co-leader Dr Andrew Brooks said. The discovery could have implications for other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, blood disorders, osteoporosis and obesity. Controlling cell growth could lead to a drug that can cure cancer"

From Birmingham to Brighton, London to south Wales, annual salaries were outstripped by increases in average house prices, research by MailOnline reveals. The data comes as Chancellor George Osborne moves to tighten the amount buyers can borrow, adding to fears that many people will struggle to ever get on to the property ladder. Across England and Wales there were 33 areas where house prices rose by more in cash terms than annual local wages, MailOnline research reveals Across England and Wales, average house prices rose by 7 per cent in the year to April to £172,069, worth an extra £10,809, according to Land Registry figures. By comparison, median earnings in 2013 were £22,045. However, in some areas the buoyant market added thousands - and tens of thousands - to property prices. The biggest rise recorded was in Westminster, in central London, where prices rose by an astonishing £160,810 to £976,822 in a year. Even in the shadow of Big Ben, median average annual salaries in the borough last year were £34,092. The story was repeated across much of London, with prices up £125,788 in Hackney, where pay was only £27,895, and up £126,587 in Hammersmith where average wages were £33,082. Outside London, prices rose by £42,411 in Windsor and Maidenhead compared to average salaries of £29,501. In his Mansion House speech last week, Mr Osborne unveiled plans to give the Bank of England new powers to limit the amount people can borrow. New rules will cap the size of loans to a multiple of the borrower's earnings, meaning that in areas where prices are rising by more than locals earn in a year, it will become even harder to buy a home. In the year to March, property prices in London rose by 17 per cent, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics Nationwide, prices are rising by around 8 per cent, but in some areas the increase is worth more than the average person earns Chancellor George Osborne last week announced he was giving the Bank of England new powers to limit loans relative to earnings, while Bank governor Mark Carney hinted interest rates could rise before the end of this year On the south coast, average earnings in Brighton and Hove stood at £22,740 but house prices rose by £28,702. In Sandwell, on the outskirts of Birmingham, homes rose by £21,945 but average incomes stood at £18,934. In Wales two areas saw prices earn more than local workers. Powys recorded property price rises of £25,621 in a year, while annual earnings were just £17,725. In the Vale of Glamorgan, house prices were up £23,124, almost £1,300 more than the average worker in the area earned. The figures for earnings are pre-tax, so the gap between take-home pay and property price rises will be even greater. Emma Reynolds, Labour’s shadow housing minister, said: 'These figures show that the dream of home ownership is slipping further out of reach for working people. 'To tackle this crisis we need to build many more homes which is why Labour have repeatedly called for action on housing supply but this government has failed to act. Under David Cameron the number of homes built has fallen to the lowest level in peacetime since the 1920s. 'Labour is clear that you can’t deal with the cost-of-living crisis without building more homes. That’s why Labour has committed to getting 200,000 homes a year built by 2020.' Booming house prices have trigged warnings that Britain could be heading for a new bust. The International Monetary Fund warned action was needed around the world to prevent a global crash. Labour's shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said the research showed the dream of home ownership is slipping further out of reach Bank of England governor Mark Carney has hinted that interest rates could rise from their historic low before the end of the year, shattering hopes that any increase would be delayed until after the election in May next year. There have been fears that the taxpayer-backed mortgages offered through the Help to Buy scheme were increasing demand while the supply of new homes remained low. Business Secretary Vince Cable, a long-term critic of the scheme, warned banks must not ‘throw fuel on the fire’ of the overheating market by offering cheap loans to people who can barely afford them. Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said:'Mortgage lending and loan-to-value ratios on new lending remain below historic average – in fact relative to earnings, median house prices across England are around the same level as in 2005. 'Help to Buy has helped thousands of hardworking people buy a new home, with some of the highest sales figures in cities including Manchester Leeds and Durham. Leading developers are building more as a direct result of the scheme, with housebuilding up a third compared to last year and at its highest level since 2007.' Property prices across London rose by 17 per cent in the year to April, more than double the average for England and Wales. The highest rises outside London were in the South East and East, up 8 per cent, and the lowest in the North East and Wales, just 3 per cent. Flats rose by 10 per cent, while all house – terraced, semi- and detached – were up by 6 per cent. Some 20 areas saw values fall in the year to April, including Blaenau Gwent down 32 per cent, Torfaen 15 per cent and Blackburn 12 per cent. Prices in Tameside were down 4 per cent, Manchester 3 per cent and Lancashire 2 per cent. Former property developer and iProperty co-founder John Candia said: 'It is extraordinary to think that some London homeowners are on course to earn more from their properties in one year than the Prime Minister makes for running the country.' However, there have been signs that the market may be cooling. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors found demand for properties from prospective buyers slipped back last month for the first time since June 2012. This is being blamed in part on a mortgage lending clampdown which came into force at the end of April. Under the new Mortgage Market Review (MMR) rules, mortgage applicants face a tougher application process and questions about their spending habits to check they would be able to cope with a rise in interest rates in the future."

""I was just profiled,"" Eduardo Caraballo told CNN in a telephone interview. The incident began on May 18, when police showed up at the building housing the school in the suburban Chicago town of Berwyn. The school is owned by his mother. The building includes a storage area where police found a car that Caraballo said he was storing for a friend -- but which turned out to have been stolen. After 48 hours in police custody, Caraballo was interviewed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, he said. ""She did not believe I was Puerto Rican because of the way I look and the way I talk,"" he said. ""I guess I have a Mexican accent."" On May 20, he was taken to the Cook County Correctional Center. Authorities there told his mother, Patricia Caraballo, that she could not bail him out because immigration had a hold on him, he said. His mother, who is Mexican, then took her son's birth certificate to immigration authorities, her son said. But immigration officials asked the younger Caraballo to describe his life in Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth; scrutinized the papers brought by his mother; and came away unpersuaded. ""Last time I was in Puerto Rico, I was 18 years old,"" Caraballo said. ""I don't really like Puerto Rico -- or Mexico. I like Chicago. I was raised here."" Finally, on Monday, an ICE supervisor allowed him to leave. ""If it was that simple, why couldn't they do it Friday?"" Caraballo asked. The Rev. Walter L. Coleman, of Lincoln United Methodist Church in Chicago, has taken up Caraballo's cause. ""This was based on a clear case of racial profiling and a clear distrust that would not have been extended to a Caucasian or somebody who was Anglo-American,"" Coleman told reporters Thursday. ""We have an integral connection between racial profiling and discrimination and the prosecution of our broken racial laws,"" he added. ""It's everywhere in this country and it's going to intensify."" Chris Bergin, a lawyer for Familia Latina Unida Ministries and Centro Sin Fronteras, said he was considering taking legal action against the government on behalf of Caraballo. That is an example of what we're facing as we see a broken immigration system that is aimed really at Latinos and aimed at intimidation and aimed at persecution and aimed at discrimination and ultimately aimed at disempowering the entire community in this country,"" Bergin said. In a statement, ICE said it ""places 'detainers' or holds on individuals whom we have reason to believe are in the U.S. in violation of law. Based upon the evidence initially available on this individual, ICE agents placed a detainer on him. However, after ICE confirmed the individual's identity as a U.S. citizen, we immediately canceled the detainer. ""This individual was held in local law enforcement custody over the weekend on an ICE detainer based on initially available information that he was an alien subject to deportation. ICE took custody of him on Monday morning and released him within one hour, after his identity was verified, and the ICE detainer was canceled."" But that explanation didn't placate Bergin. ""They're supposed to be the experts in this and they didn't act like experts,"" he said. ""When it comes to Latinos, what has happened is they have flipped the coin on its head: The burden of proof now is on them to prove that they are legal, that they are citizens. ... That is not what America is about."" And ICE's defense raised eyebrows from Jacqueline Stevens, professor of political science at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, outside Chicago. ""Their defense is only valid if someone is foreign-born,"" she said. ""It's not a valid defense if someone is asserting that they're born in the United States. That's basically kidnapping and false imprisonment."" But such incidents are not unusual, said Stevens, who went through the files of an immigration and refugee rights project and found that 82 cases -- 1 percent of the total -- involved U.S. citizens, most of whom had been held for one to three months. That would translate to 4,000 of the 400,000 people detained last year by ICE, Stevens said. She also tracked 30 cases since 2003 where ICE went a step further and deported U.S. citizens, she said. In one case, it took a man wrongfully deported to Jamaica a decade to put together the paperwork to return to the United States, she said."

If true, that would represent a scientific advance, but not necessarily a treatment advance, said researchers familiar with the work. In the study, published last week online in the journal Blood, researchers at Charite-University Medicine Berlin treated an HIV-infected man who also had acute myeloid leukemia -- a cancer of the immune system -- by wiping out his own immune system with high-dose chemotherapy and radiation and giving him a stem-cell transplant. Stem cells are immature cells that can mature into blood cells. At the time of the transplant, which occurred in February 2007, he stopped taking anti-HIV medications. Why HIV advance isn't a universal cure Thirteen months later, after a relapse of the leukemia, he underwent a second round of treatment followed by another stem-cell transplant from the same donor. The donor's stem cells contained a rare, inherited gene mutation that made them naturally resistant to infection with HIV, according to the authors, led by Kristina Allers, who hypothesized that HIV would nevertheless rebound over time. But that has not happened. After three-and-a-half years off of anti-HIV drugs, the patient shows no sign of either leukemia or HIV replication and his immune system has been restored to normal health, the researchers reported, concluding, ""our results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient."" But AIDS researchers predicted the report will have little impact on practice. ""This probably is a cure, but it comes at a bit of a price,"" said Dr. Michael Saag, professor of medicine and director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham AIDS Center. ""For him to receive the donor cells, his body had to have all of his immune system wiped out"" and then receive a bone marrow transplant, Saag noted. ""The Catch-22 here is that the best candidates for a cure, ideally, are people who are healthy"" and don't have leukemia. The treatment associated with wiping out the immune system ""is very hazardous,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""Even if somebody doesn't die from a transplant, there are complications that make it very unpleasant for people to live with,"" he said, citing graft-versus-host disease, where the infused donor cells attack the body. In a number of cases, the transplant proves fatal. The study is a proof of the concept ""that our understanding of HIV biology is correct, and that if you eliminate -- not just in theory but in practice -- all of the cells in the body that are producing HIV and replace them with uninfected cells, you have a cure,"" Saag said. But remaining infected with HIV is not always associated with the same grim outcome that was the norm prior to the mid-1990s, when more effective anti-HIV drugs were developed, he said. ""We can keep people alive for a normal life span,"" he said. ""That means a 25-year-old diagnosed today with HIV has a reasonably good chance of living to 80, 85, 90."" Further limiting the treatment's potential appeal is the fact that it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for each patient who gets it, he said. ""It's not going to be applicable unless they develop leukemia or lymphoma and need a bone-marrow transplant,""Saag said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called it impractical. ""It's hard enough to get a good compatible match for a transplant like this,"" he said in a statement. ""But you also have to find (a) compatible donor that has this genetic defect, and this defect is only found in 1% of the Caucasian population and 0% of the black population. This is very rare."" But HIV itself is not. According to the World Health Organization, 33.4 million people worldwide have the virus that causes AIDS."

Amber Renea Williamson faces two counts of sexual misconduct with a minor after a six week investigation that led Indiana State Police to her. Despite being told she was under investigation, Williamson remained in contact with her teen lover by sending him messages on Facebook. A cell phone belonging to Williamson contained text messages she had sent the teenager, including one which read: 'I want you and only you in my life and heart.' Police in Columbus, Indiana, said the boyfriend of the teen's mother peered through a garage window and saw the youngster in bed with Williamson. The teen has told police he had sex with Williamson and her home and in a garage attached to his home. The investigation began in September after police received a tip off about the inappropriate relationship, she was arrested last Tuesday but released on a $10,000 bond. An investigation into the woman's relationship with the teen started in mid-September. Sheriff's officials said the teen's cell phone contained text messages to Williamson, and she sent a love letter to the boy saying, 'I want you and only you in my life and heart.' The boy told sheriff's deputies that he and the woman had had sexual relations several times since July, according to an affidavit. Williamson was not at home when police came to arrest here, but she was later found walking near her apartment. She faces two counts of sexual misconduct with a minor, both Class B felonies, and one Class A misdemeanor count of invasion of privacy. A Class B felony carries a sentence of six to 20 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine and a Class A misdemeanor can carry a maximum one-year prison sentence and a maximum $5,000 fine. Williamson was booked into custody at the Brown County Jail and released on $10,000 bond."

The boycott was sparked by Seattle-based blogger Dan Savage, who urged people to dump Russian vodka to 'draw international attention to the persecution of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, trans people and straight allies in Putin's increasingly fascistic Russia'.

That's not the only option, though, argue the experts at lingerie boutique Intimacy. In fact, one can wear a racy red bra under a white shirt or tee, and no-one will be any the wiser. Nicole Willis, bra fit stylist at the store on Madison Avenue in New York, tells MailOnline that the hue works well with many skin tones - but the darker one's skin, the better it works. Ladies in red: The staff at the Intimacy boutique on New York's Madison Avenue demonstrate how scarlet bras look invisible under white shirts 'It's really a fun way to get you out of the routine of wearing boring, nude bras and incorporate some colors back into your wardrobe to wear on a more regular basis,' she said. Staff at the chain, which is affiliated with the UK's venerable Rigby & Peller, swear by the idea - to the degree that they posed for a photo to prove it. As promised, the only glimpses of red seen are the straps the ladies chose to expose. Ms Willis also shared her words of wisdom on the bras that every woman should own. Of the four styles that she most recommends, she says that a plunge bra is vital for when one is wearing V-necks and wrap dresses. A lace bra, she continues, boasts form and function as it is best for centering and lifting the breasts under fitted garments like button-down shirts and tailored dresses. Other essentials include a perfectly-fitting strapless bra and the all-important sports bra. 'Women should have the most breast support while working out and should never have to wear two bras to get it,' Ms Willis said."

Police say they're trying to figure that out. University officers arrested Justin Miles Jasper, a 21-year-old Nevada man, on Wednesday night after finding him near the Seattle school in a truck that had been reported stolen recently from a Butte, Montana, residence, campus police Chief John Vinson said Thursday. Investigators found Molotov cocktails, a ballistic vest and two allegedly stolen guns -- a scoped rifle and a shotgun -- in the truck's bed after getting consent to search it, Vinson told reporters. Vinson said he believed no ammunition was found. Investigators were trying to get a warrant to search the truck's cab Thursday, university police said. ""We have no idea what his intentions were,"" Vinson said. ""... We don't have any information that would suggest any type of attack, but this is an active, ongoing investigation."" Prosecutors said Jasper also had detailed maps of three university campuses -- University of Washington, South Seattle Community College, and Seattle University -- in his possession, according to CNN affiliate KIRO. Bail has been set at $2 million for Jasper, CNN affiliate KING reported. Police said Jasper is not a University of Washington student and that they're trying to figure out whether he has any connections to the area, and why he was in Seattle. Police initially found him sleeping in the truck on campus on Tuesday, a day before the arrest, Vinson said. At the time, a check of the plate found nothing, so they sent him on his way. But on Wednesday, ""the vehicle was entered as stolen from Montana,"" so officers looked for the vehicle and stopped it not far from campus at about 10:30 p.m., Vinson said. Police arrested the man on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle. Vinson said he had no reason to believe the university -- which he said had few students or staff heading into the Fourth of July -- is under any threat. But police still have questions. ""Anytime that you have someone who has body armor ... long guns and also incendiary devices, that's a significant concern,"" said Jim Pugel, interim chief of the Seattle Police Department, which is helping university police in the case. The FBI also is assisting the probe, Vinson said. CNN's Amanda Watts and Jason Hanna contributed to this story."

According to federal prosecutors, 48-year-old Dr. Farid Fata, of Oakland Township, 'systematically defrauded Medicare by submitting false claims for services that were medically unnecessary.' According to the complaint, Fata defrauded the federally funded healthcare program out of roughly $35million over a two-year period. Scam: Dr. Farid Fata is accused of administering cancer treatment to people who didn't need it to scam Medicare On Tuesday, federal authorities took Fata - who owns and operates Michigan Hematology Oncology Centers - into custody and raided several of his offices in the Detroit area, seizing medical records they say will show that he was misdiagnosing patients in a scam to steal from the federal government. 'Violating a patient's trust and placing them at risk through fraudulent abuse of our nation's health care system is deplorable,' FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert D. Foley III said in a news release. At a bond hearing on Friday, Jeff Berz, whose father was one of Fata's patients, testified that Fata refused to stop administering drugs after his father didn't respond to chemotherapy. 'From the time that my father began getting the chemotherapy, his health deteriorated,' he said. Angela Swantek, an oncology nurse who spent time at one of Fata's clinics, told ABC News that she first complained to investigators about Fata's alleged wrongdoings as far back as 2010. Raid: Federal agents seized medical records from several of Fata's Detroit-area offices on Tuesday 'I don't know how he's gotten away with it for this long,' she told ABC News. 'I was disgusted. I got in the car, I was still sitting in the parking lot and I was truly almost in tears just because of what I saw and how patients were getting their chemotherapy.' Fata's attorney, Christopher Andreoff, says the government is wrong and that his clients was not guilty of anything. 'The government has not retained an expert to give an opinion that there was a mistreatment, or misdiagnosis, or unnecessary tests given to any patient,' he said. History: Oncology nurse Angela Swantek says she complained to investigators about Fata in 2010 Fata is due back in court on Tuesday for a bond hearing, as federal prosecutors try to keep him behind bars while he awaits trial. For now, Fata's bond has been set at $170,000. Under his current bond conditions, Fata would be subject to home confinement and be required to wear an electronic monitoring anklet 24 hours a day. Additionally, he would not be allowed to practice medicine or prescribe medications. If convicted, Fata faces up to 20 years in jail."

'Everybody knows Condoleezza Rice was President Bush’s Secretary of State but I'm very pleased to announce she has a new job as of today,' host Bob Schieffer said in introducing Rice as a guest on his round-table panel discussion on Sunday. 'As of today, she's joining CBS News as a contributor,' Scheiffer added. 'We're honored to have you.' Rice, who wore a red dress on the show, smiled broadly as Schieffer introduced her new role, and then seemed to chuckle as he turned the conversation over to her. Undefined: Rice will reportedly be a 'contributor' for the network, but her duties at CBS were not specifically explained in a widely-circulated statement 'Well, frankly, the first one is a lot more exciting than the second,' Rice said of George W. Bush's first versus his second presidential inauguration. 'I remember being completely taken with the moment (during the first one, but) by the second one, I thought, 'Ya' know I really need to get to work.' Rice served as National Security Adviser during Bush's first term, and then succeeded Colin Powel as Secretary of State during the 43rd president's final four years in office. Rice then joked on 'Face the Nation' about the redundancy of officials performing not one - but two - background checks on her at the beginning of both the first and second Bush terms in the White House. Mixing it up: Rice seemed well at ease on 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, smiling often and broadly and even joking about the redundancy of the background checks performed on her before both Bush's first and second terms 'I remember thinking - because they were actually going out and talking to my neighbors again - and I remember thinking, didn't we just do this four years ago?' she told Schieffer on the show. 'You know what I've been doing for the last four years.' In March of 2009, Rice reportedly returned to Stanford University -  where she taught prior to joining Bush's White House - as a political science professor. As of late 2010, she had become a full faculty member of Stanford's business school. WATCH VIDEO HERE"

Egyptians take part in the funeral of Marwa Sherbini, who was murdered in Germany last week. Sherbini, 33, was stabbed to death Wednesday in a courtroom as she prepared to give testimony against a German man of Russian descent whom she had sued for insult and abuse. The man, identified in German media as Alex A., 28, was convicted of calling Sherbini, who wore a headscarf, ""terrorist,"" ""bitch"" and ""Islamist"" when she asked him him to leave a swing for her 3-year-old son Mustafa during an August 2008 visit to a children's park. He was fined and appealed the ruling. The two were in court Wednesday for that appeal when Alex A. attacked, pulling out a knife and stabbing Sherbini 18 times. He also stabbed her husband three times and attacked another person. According to Arab media, police officers tried to intervene to end the fight, and a number of shots were fired. One hit the husband, who fell unconscious and is currently in intensive care in the hospital of Dresden University. Sherbini was three months pregnant at the time of her death. Hundreds attended Sherbini's funeral in Alexandria, Egypt, her hometown, among them government officials, including Egyptian Manpower Minister Aisha Abdel Hadi and Telecommunications Minister Tariq Kamel, Egyptian media reported. Many shouted hostile slogans against Germany and called for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to take a firm stand on the incident. Egypt's grand mufti, Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi, demanded the severest punishment to be issued against Alex A. Berlin witnessed angry protests on Saturday, when hundreds of Arabs and Muslims demonstrated after a funeral prayer that called her killing an outrageous racist murder against Muslims. In a phone call with Al Arabiya, Marwa's brother, Tariq Sherbini, said, ""Extremism has no religion. My sister was killed simply because she wore the veil. This incident clearly shows that extremism is not limited to one religion or another and it is not exclusively carried out by Muslims."" ""We are only asking for a fair punishment,"" he said, adding that his sister was not a radical. ""She was a religious woman who prayed and wore her headscarf, but she was killed because of her belief."" Anger about Sherbini's death smoldered online, as Twitterers and bloggers pushed the cause. ""She is a victim of hatred and racism,"" tweeted Ghada Essawy, among many other Arab twitters and bloggers. Essawy called Sherbini ""the martyr of the veil."" Various videos circulated on YouTube calling on Egypt to take action and urging Germany to address what their makers saw as a new wave of hatred against Arabs and Muslims in its community. One video showed various pictures of a young happy Marwa saying that ""The woman stood up for her rights and she was killed. May God bless her."" The English font in the video presentation asked ""when will Egypt cares for its citizens' rights inside Egypt and abroad."" Sherbini and her husband moved to Dresden in 2003, after the husband received a grant to study genetic engineering in the renowned Max Planck Institute. He was scheduled to present his Ph.D. thesis in the coming days. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report."

The 24-year-old could be in trouble with golf's authorities after a foul-mouthed reaction to a missed putt during the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai. Reed, who starred for America during its recent Ryder Cup defeat to Europe, was caught on camera swearing and using a term which could be deemed homophobic. After making a bogey on the 10th hole at the Sheshan International, Reed was heard to say: ""Nice f****** three-putt you f****** f****t."" Reed, who finished the opening round five shots behind leader Graeme McDowell -- his playing partner -- was quick to apologize on Twitter, but could now face sanctions. The PGA Tour has rules that govern against poor language on the course, and it said in a statement they were aware of the situation. ""The PGA Tour's Conduct Unbecoming regulations prohibit the use of obscene language on the golf course,"" it said. ""The PGA Tour will deal with this matter internally in accordance with its regulations."" Reed has enjoyed a breakthrough year in 2014, winning two events, including the WGC Cadillac Championship back in March. After that victory -- the biggest of his career to date -- Reed compared himself to 14-time major champion Tiger Woods and declared himself to be ""one of the top five players in the world."" He also caused controversy during his first appearance for the United States in its biennial team battle against Europe at the Ryder Cup, held in Scotland back in September. Reed, who was unbeaten in his four matches at the competition, shushed the galleries during one of his matches, which earned him a chorus of boos from the home supporters. Reed fully embraced his pantomime villain status and was lauded for his passion to the cause as Team USA slumped to a sixth defeat in the last seven tournaments. ""This is the best event I've ever played in my life,"" Reed told reporters after his debut appearance. ""Just to get to know these guys and to be out here means a lot to me. ""I definitely want to be back and I'll definitely be trying even harder just to come back."" Northern Ireland's McDowell shot an opening round of 67 after recording seven birdies in 12 holes on Thursday at the the $8.5 million showpiece. The 2010 U.S. Open champion leads by two shots from a clutch of players on three-under, including Rickie Fowler and reigning U.S. Open champion Martin Kaymer, from Germany. ""A big key to this golf course is driving the ball well. I drove it very well today,"" McDowell told reporters. ""And the greens are in fantastic shape, and I actually putted very well. Dropped a couple coming in, but all in all, very pleased with five-under par on what I thought was a reasonably tricky day."""

The protesting students allegedly stormed the colleges of trade, engineering and science at Azhar University and set fire to its cafeteria, according to the official MENA news agency. Authorities arrested 60 students, the Ministry of the Interior told state-run Nile TV. The protesters were armed with Molotov cocktails and other weapons, the ministry said. One student was killed in the violence, the Muslim Brotherhood said in a statement. The Brotherhood said security forces, ""in an attempt to silence any voice of opposition,"" fired tear gas, live bullets and birdshot at the protesting students. Students at the university have been on strike following the killings of students and professors by security forces, the Muslim Brotherhood said. The clash at the university was the latest in a string of incidents between security forces and backers of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian government last week declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization, an Islamist group which helped propel ousted President Mohamed Morsy to power. Morsy, the nation's first democratically elected president, was forced out of office in July by the nation's military and arrested following widespread protests and petitions calling for his removal. Opponents said he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values. Supporters called his removal a coup and a blow to the democratic movement that toppled former Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011. In clashes in Cairo on Friday, at least three people died and 265 were arrested. CNN's Ian Lee contributed to this report."

Again. If that wasn't clear enough already, it became abundantly so at the end of Newt Gingrich's victory speech in South Carolina last weekend. As Gingrich left the stage, his campaign staff played a song through the speaker system. The song was ""Only in America,"" by the country duo Brooks & Dunn. Of course. That song has become a bipartisan standard in recent presidential campaigns. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney used it at their rallies; Barack Obama used it at his rallies; John McCain used it at his rallies; and now Gingrich is using it. Mitt Romney, too. Politicians have long utilized campaign songs, but it is unusual for Republicans and Democrats to share the same song. After Bill Clinton used Fleetwood Mac's ""Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow)"" in his 1992 campaign, it would have been inconceivable for a Republican opponent to use it at GOP rallies that year, or for Republicans four years later to use it. It would have reminded potential voters of the other guy. But ""Only in America"" has managed to transcend party lines; its lyrics, about the U.S. ideal of opportunity for all, seem to speak to a deeply held national belief, even a yearning, and the insistent opening guitar chords rivet an audience. ""Only in America,"" Ronnie Dunn's voice sings, ""Dreaming in red, white and blue; Only in America, Where we dream as big as we want to. ..."" When Obama, late in the summer of 2008, finished his speech accepting his party's nomination for president in that packed Invesco Field football stadium in Denver, there was the Brooks & Dunn song booming out of the speakers, becoming the soundtrack of the historic moment. That four years earlier the song had been playing at Bush/Cheney events didn't seem to matter. ""We all get a chance, Everybody gets to dance. ..."" Brooks & Dunn, after a 20-year career of platinum albums and No. 1 hits, have broken up and no longer perform together. But last week I was able to get in touch with both Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn, and in separate conversations we talked about what having their song become the go-to anthem for presidential candidates means. ""The song was never intended to be partisan, and it isn't,"" said Dunn. He was in rehearsals for a solo tour in support of his new single, ""Let the Cowboy Rock,"" and even though the Brooks & Dunn duo is no more, he said he often thinks about the political life that song of theirs has taken on. ""It's about the opportunity, in America, to try to attain anything you want,"" he said. When, in 2008, the song began to be heard at rallies for both sides (neither candidate had asked for their permission), he and Brooks made the decision not to say anything publicly about their private political preferences: ""We kind of laid low. We did that on purpose."" Which made all kinds of sense. Some singers and bands, when their songs are played by candidates they don't favor, loudly demand that the candidate stop immediately. Dunn and his partner instinctively realized that if both parties had adopted ""Only in America,"" they should just sit back and let their work be constantly heard by citizens of every political persuasion. When good fortune unexpectedly comes raining down on you, the last thing you want to do is reach for an umbrella. ""I'm moved by the whole thing,"" Dunn said. ""Of all the voices in America, to have my voice be the one that sings those words . . . ."" Kix Brooks, who is completing his own solo album and also hosts the syndicated radio show ""American Country Countdown,"" told me, ""The song was never Republican or Democrat. I think that politicians of both parties get that."" Brooks wrote the song, in collaboration with Nashville songwriters Don Cook and Ronnie Rogers, as simply ""an appreciation of our freedoms in America."" When Brooks & Dunn were filling arenas and stadiums night after night, there would come a moment, midway through ""Only in America,"" when local members of the military invited by the band -- usually four or five of them, from the different branches, always in uniform -- would march in crisp formation onto the stage, and would face the audience, then salute.

It might be the one and only time in the lives of the young men and women from the Army, the Marines, the Navy and the Air Force when they would have a moment like this: when they would be onstage in front of tens of thousand of people, and be applauded with gratitude for the sacrifice they were making. ""After the song,"" Brooks said, ""the soldiers would leave the stage, and I would look at them, and they would just be glowing."" Campaign songs have always been a tradition with presidential candidates -- ""Marching with McKinley"" for William McKinley, ""He's All Right"" for Benjamin Harrison, ""Get On a Raft with Taft"" for William Howard Taft, ""Keep Cool and Keep Coolidge"" for Calvin Coolidge -- but only in recent years have songs that are already big hits, and that were not written for a candidate, been made a regular part of campaign playlists. With the Brooks & Dunn song, neither political party seems to want to be the one not to play it. It has, without any push from the men who sang it, managed to become a part of the presidential process. ""If the candidates want our song to come out of their speakers, it's fine with me,"" said Brooks, who was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, during Dwight D. Eisenhower's first term.

Stiviano, who was denied entry last night. The Hollywood nightclub is one of LA’s most popular destinations for celebrities, boasting visits from the likes of Bono, Sean Combs - aka Puffy Daddy - and Robert Pattinson. Stiviano, 31, was pictured outside the club last night in a low-cut red dress and managed a smile for the paparazzi, despite not being allowed to go in. Scroll down for video V. Stiviano was reportedly denied entry to trendy Los Angeles night-spot 1 Oak - but still managed a grin for the waiting paparazzi Stiviano gained national notoriety earlier this year due to her alleged sexual relationship with Donald Sterling A burly bouncer refused to grant her access, so Stiviano resorted to pacing up and down the sidewalk while photographers snapped away. At one point she phoned a friend, but that didn't help, with security politely asking her to step away from the entrance. Last week there was speculation that the model was back with her ex, the disgraced former NBA owner Donald Sterling. It surfaced after his ex wife Shelly reportedly called the police when she learned that Stiviano was at his Beverly Hills mansion. The tryst prompted her to claim to the police that Stiviano had broken into the property. However, police were told by Donald that the model was an ‘invited guest’, according to TMZ and she stayed in the property after they left. In August Stiviano claimed that the former L.A. Clippers owner is gay and that she spent three years acting as his 'beard' so no one would suspect his true sexuality. Stiviano, who gained national notoriety earlier this year due to her alleged sexual relationship with Sterling, made the bombshell allegation in documents filed at the Los Angeles Superior Court in answer to a prior lawsuit filed by Sterling’s wife, Shelly. In her original lawsuit, Shelly had accused Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling Family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8 million house on the outskirts of Beverly Hills in exchange for sexual favors. Donald Sterling’s wife Shelly reportedly called the police when she learned that V.Stiviano (right, with Sterling) was at his Beverly Hills mansion Shelly (left) had accused Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8 million house on the outskirts of Beverly Hills Stiviano denies those allegations and even claims that Shelly Sterling was well aware of the exact nature of the relationship between Donald Sterling and Stiviano. ‘V.S. was D.T.S’s beard for three years prior to the filing of suit,’ the answer claimed. ‘V.S. is informed and believes that (Sterling) is a homosexual and enjoys sexual acts and or sexual congress with males.’ The answer said that Shelly Sterling was ‘acutely aware of his orientation and condoned’ his behavior, including his decision to give ‘gifts, money and other properties’ to Stiviano for her public companionship, reports the Daily News. Stiviano also says that she ‘was not ever a sexual partner’ of Donald Sterling. She also states that the gifts are considered separate property, not 'marital or community property,' because they were purchased with funds earned by Donald after separation or 'estrangement' from her wife. Stiviano also filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit against the Sterlings on Thursday. She claims they slandered her in the media by calling her a thief and saying she embezzled money and property from Donald. 'She’s delusional,’ Sterling’s lawyer, Max Blecher, told The Daily News. The drama began in April when a recording surfaced of Donald Sterling berating Stiviano for bringing black men to Clippers games. The audio spurred the NBA to ban Sterling for life and fine him $2.5 million. Shelly, his wife of 58 years, then took control of a family trust and negotiated a record $2 billion sale of the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Shelly Sterling said she was initially given her husband's blessing to sell the team and he praised the deal she reached. When it came time to sign it at the end of May, however, Sterling said he would not sell and would sue the league. Ballmer officially became the new owner of the Los Angeles Clippers at the end of August."

The Queen warned last night that focusing too much attention on the Ebola outbreak could lead to an upsurge in other deadly diseases such as malaria. She was speaking at an event at London’s Chatham House Speaking to one of the world’s top epidemiologists, Professor David Heymann, she told him she worried that those with feverish symptoms which could be malaria are being turned away from hospitals because they were too busy dealing with Ebola patients. Professor Heymann said he was impressed at her at her level of knowledge on the subject and described her as ‘very perceptive.’ He said: ‘She felt very strongly about it. ‘She was very interested in Ebola because she said her doctor told her that there are more people dying from malaria every week than are dying from Ebola - and he was right. ‘Ebola is getting all the attention and malaria is not. ‘She is afraid that malaria will have a comeback because people are not paying enough attention to it.’ Professor Heymann is a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and was the former assistant director-general for infectious diseases at the World Health Organisation. He investigated the first Ebola outbreak in 1976 and has worked on three subsequent outbreaks since then. The monarch said she worried that Ebola, which has claimed 5,000 lives already, risked overshadowing the risk from other deadlier diseases like malaria, which kills the same number every week After meeting the Queen at the event at London’s Chatham House, he added he believed that she was absolutely right in her concerns. He added: ‘There is a great fear that there will be an increase in deaths from common childhood diseases like malaria and diarrhoeal diseases. ‘She is very perceptive. Unfortunately this should not detract attention from Ebola, which must be stopped. It is a terrible disease. Queen Elizabeth II and Dr Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, remove the first brick in a new extension, during a visit to launch The Queen Elizabeth II Academy for Leadership in International Affairs at Chatham House in London ‘What the Queen has done is call attention to other infectious diseases which are with us every day and cause much greater misery, but not in such a spectacular way. ‘She asked a very piercing and important question which means at she has analysed clearly the world situation of disease and she’s come to this conclusion which is the right conclusion.’ Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen was visiting foreign affairs think tank Chatham House to launch a new leadership academy. The Queen Elizabeth II Academy for Leadership in International Affairs will offer leaders the chance to develop skills to deal with major policy challenges and the critical issues facing the world. During her visit, she removed a brick from the wall between Chatham House - the Royal Institute of International Affairs - and neighbouring Ames House to symbolise the expansion next door, where the leadership academy will be based."

Dias Kadyrbayev will be changing his plea in a federal courtroom Thursday, his lawyer, Robert Stahl, told CNN, adding that he'll have more to say after the hearing. The charges stem from actions after bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. Three people were killed and more than 200 were injured. Kadyrbayev is charged with four counts including obstructing justice and conspiracy for allegedly throwing Tsarnaev's backpack into a dumpster after discovering it contained fireworks with gunpowder, and removing a jar of Vaseline and a computer thumb drive. The backpack was later recovered at a landfill by investigators. Kadrybayev, a Kazakh national, also allegedly took Tsarnaev's computer to his off-campus apartment, where the FBI later seized it. In July, Kadyrbayev's roommate Azamat Tazhayakov was convicted of conspiracy and obstruction charges in the same case and has filed an appeal. He faces up to 25 years in prison at his sentencing in October. In that case, prosecutors told jurors Tazhayakov knew the identity of the suspected bombers -- Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- before the public found out, allegedly texting Kadyrbayev: ""i think they got his brother,"" hours before the public knew their names or their relationship to one another. The friends recognized the Tsarnaev brothers after authorities released video and still photos asking for the public's helping finding the two men in the aftermath of the bombings, prosecutors said. Kadyrbayev told his friends that he believed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ""used the Vaseline 'to make bombs,' or words to that effect,"" an indictment against him reads. The government said Tsarnaev texted Kadyrbayev after the bombings and told him he could go to his dorm room and take what he wanted. Kadyrbayev showed that text to Tazhayakov, the government alleged.

China's official Xinhua News Agency said protesters attacked passersby, burned public buses and blocked traffic. The report did not say how many people took part in the protest or what their grievances were. But a witness in Urumqi told CNN that, soon after the protest started around 5 p.m., ""hundreds [of protesters] grew into easily over a thousand -- men, women and children, all ethnic Uyghurs, screaming and chanting."" Local police arrived quickly and tried to control the swelling crowd by erecting barriers in the street, but ""people pushed them over,"" the witness said. ""They were throwing rocks at passing cars and buses."" As the violence escalated, hundreds of anti-riot police arrived on the scene, the witness said. ""They used tear gas and fire hoses to disperse the crowd. I saw fire trucks, ambulances, armed personnel carriers, and what looked like tanks. I heard random gunshots."" Late Sunday, the witness said Urumqi was in a lockdown, with hundreds of People's Liberation Army soldiers in the streets. He reported seeing riot police chasing protesters into alleyways and rounding up ""many"" of them. The witness speculated that the protest, which took place in the predominantly Uyghur-populated Bazaar district, may have been a reaction to racial violence in southern Guangdong province. The racial violence reportedly happened at a toy factory in Guangdong Province, where many migrants, including Uyghurs, have moved in search of work. A massive brawl reportedly broke out between workers of Uyghur and Han nationalities. Two Uyghurs reportedly died in the violent clash. Xinjiang is home to many Uyghurs. China's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy. However, ethnic tensions run deep. Minority groups like the Uyghurs complain that they are treated as second-class citizens and are subjected to discrimination by the majority Han nationalities. ""What was clear was the Uyghur protesters were not happy,"" the witness in Urumqi said. ""They broke windows of public buses, threw bottles and rocks at the police and harassed what looked like Chinese of Han or Hui nationalities. I saw a Uyghur man kick a Han woman in the behind as she tried to get away from the crowds."" It was not clear, from official reports or the witness' account, if there were any casualties. A spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, a dissident Uyghur group based in Munich, Germany, told CNN that local Uyghur people in Urumqi and Xinjiang had told him by telephone that they had seen bodies thrown into military vehicles. Dilxat Raxit added that tens of thousands of demonstrators had gathered in every Uyghur neighborhood in Urumqi to protest peacefully against what he described as the government's ethnic cleansing in Guangdong Shaoguan. After about 40 minutes during which the crowd shouted slogans, calling the incident in Guangdong Shaoguan a planned ethnic cleansing, the Chinese military began to crack down by sending more than 50 military vehicles -- including tanks -- carrying troops into Urumqi. All Uyghurs were ordered off the street, he said. Sources in Kashgar said a ""massive number"" of Chinese PLA forces entered that city as well, and that students were ordered to remain inside. People were also arrested along roads leading to Urumqi, he said. ""According to the Chinese law, people have the right to protest peacefully,"" the World Uyghur Congress said in an appeal. ""We call for attention to this kind of ethnic discrimination."""

Sadar Ahmad feared he would be blinded after Simon Southern approached him in a public park, took out a bottle of the caustic chemical and aimed it at his face, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Southern, 26, then drew a 10-inch dagger from his walking stick and tried to goad Mr Ahmad and his friends into fighting him. Deadly: Simon Southern (left) concealed a 10-inch dagger inside his walking stick (right) and wielded it in an attack in which he sprayed ammonia at two men The court was told that he had adapted the crutch to protect himself because he felt threatened over the break-up of a relationship. Shortly before the attack in Newcastle's Leazes Park, Mr Ahmad and his friends had heard a group of white men, including Southern, shouting racist slurs. Prosecutor Stephen Duffield told the court: 'The defendant had a squeezy bottle which had ammonia in it and he sprayed that into Mr Ahmad’s face. 'Mr Ahmad immediately felt his eyes burning.' Southern, who at the time was on bail for another offence, then sprayed the ammonia at one of Mr Ahmad's friends. Fortunately, the second man was able to cover his face with his hands and protect himself. Moments later, Southern pulled out the dagger. Mr Duffield said: 'The weapon was concealed in the walking aid. It was produced and he used it to threaten the group shouting ""come on, come on"".' In a victim statement read out in court, Mr Ahmad said that he had been left with badly blurred vision in his left eye, but a consultant at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary was confident that he would make a good recovery. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Southern adapted the crutch to protect himself because he felt threatened over the break-up of a relationship Southern, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, admitted grievous bodily harm with intent and possessing an offensive weapon. The court heard that, at the time of the attack in September last year, Southern was already on bail for an affray incident in which he was caught with an axe in Wallsend. Kieran O’Neil, defending, told the hearing that Southern had only recently been released from hospital after five weeks of treatment for a blood clot. On the day of the attack he had mixed alcohol and drugs with a ‘cocktail’ of prescribed medication. Sentencing Southern to six years in prison, plus an extended four-year licence period for public protection, Recorder William Lowe said the crime had a number of 'aggravating features'. The recorder said: 'There was the use of weapons, there was an intention in my judgement to cause more serious harm than actually resulted, and the location was a public park where people of all ages spend their leisure time.'"

This was not the first time that Shoaib Mughal, Humbal Akhtar and Muahammed Shahid have been the targets of Pakistani police operations. The three were arrested in May in connection with the same plot, but they appear not to have been charged and were released. The three were arrested as they traveled in a car on the outskirts of Islamabad, police said. They appeared before a judge where they confessed, Islamabad Deputy Police Chief Bin Yamin said. A 23-page confession statement was submitted for each defendant, he said. Police also said they found Pakistani Taliban literature and maps of the parliament building and the houses of the president and prime minister. Police say Shahzad stayed with Mughal during a visit to Pakistan last year. The three confessed to having received training from the Pakistani Taliban and to having had contact with senior members of that organization, including Hakimullah Mehsud and Qari Hussain, police said. According to their confessions, they took Shahzad to northwest Pakistan to meet with the Taliban leadership and to take part in training at least four or five times, Yamin said. Police said the men had wired $13,500 to Shahzad from Pakistan to the United States, and that they also helped him in the preparation of explosive materials. Prosecutors will present their case in court in 15 days, Yamin said. The three ""preached jihad and had strong hatred against normal people, including Americans,"" he said. Shahzad is accused of attempting to set off a vehicle bomb in Times Square on May 1. The device failed to detonate. He was arrested two days later while trying to leave the country on a flight from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Shahzad's arrest heightened concerns about the Pakistani Taliban, who authorities believe directed the Times Square plot. U.S. intelligence officials fear that the Taliban are plotting to strike within the United States and are targeting American interests overseas."

She said her boss had previously only allowed her to refile the barbecues with a more experienced employee present.

It has been pegged as less popular than lice, cockroaches, the IRS and eating vegetables. A new round of derision surfaced as the House and Senate began their August recess, leaving mounds of unfinished business in their wake. Arguably the most pressing thing is stalled legislation to address the surge of migrant youth, many of them unaccompanied, across the southern border this year. (Congress did get some things done in the final days before its summer break. It agreed to keep road construction projects funded through next May, provide more money for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, and overhaul the Veterans Affairs medical system). But fresh polls confirm that Congress is not doing a whole lot of legislating and the public doesn't like it. A new poll Monday by NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist College found that only 3% of registered voters surveyed thought Congress has been ""productive."" And the Pew Research Center found that this Congress has been the least productive one since 1997-98. Finally, a July Gallup poll found that Congress had a 15% approval rating. Polls convey public opinion scientifically, but the freewheeling nature of social media produced similar sentiment. An executive at the libertarian Cato Institute pointed out that Congress and President Barack Obama are less popular than the most disliked Star Wars characters. But everyone loves Internet news.

David Villa leads the race for the Golden Boot after his fourth tournament goal saw Spain defeat Sweden 2-1. The match had looked set to end in a draw after Zlatan Ibrahimovic had equalized following Fernando Torres' 15th-minute goal. However, a long ball out of defense dropped kindly for Villa and the striker slipped the ball to the left of goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson for his fourth goal of the tournament. The result leaves Spain with six points in Group D, three more than Sweden and Russia and certain of top spot after beating both those teams. Torres had put Spain in front when he lunged at a pass from David Silva, with his right foot outstretched, to touch the ball past Isaksson. Sweden veteran Henrik Larsson had shot over the bar and Johan Elmander, who scored against Spain in a qualifying match for Euro 2008, missed two chances before Fredrik Stoor curled a pass from the right to Ibrahimovic in the area in the 34th minute. The Inter Milan striker turned away from marker Sergio Ramos and hit a low shot that just made it under goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Spain controlled early on and it was no surprise when Torres put them ahead with his first goal of the tournament. Silva chipped a diagonal pass into the area toward Joan Capdevila, but Torres stuck out his right foot to intercept and touch it in for his 16th goal in 51 appearances for Spain. Larsson and Johan Elmander both had their chances before Stoor found Ibrahimovic at the far post. Ibrahimovic initially tried to volley Stoor's cross from the right and regained control before shrugging Ramos to the ground. He then swerved to score with a low right-footed shot that Casillas got a hand to but could not keep out. It was the second straight match in which Ibrahimovic had scored, after he ended a near three-year scoring drought in a 2-0 victory against Greece. Villa was in the team despite sustaining a hairline fracture of his right index finger while celebrating the first of his hat-trick goals against Russia, and the Sweden defense kept him under wraps until the 38th minute, when Isaksson had to stop a low shot. Elmander, who started in place of the injured Christian Wilhelmsson, was troubling Spain down the flank but was lucky not to concede a penalty for a nudge on David Silva just before halftime. Markus Rosenberg came on for Ibrahimovic to start the second half, with Sweden not wanting to risk their star player's swollen left knee. There were few clear chances in the second half, and those that came went to Spain. Sweden's attack sorely lacked the physical presence of Ibrahimovic, and Larsson just failed to meet Petter Hansson's cross at the far post in the 79th minute for his team's best opportunity. At the other end, Villa jumped on Silva's rebound in the 63rd minute and fired straight at Isaksson from close range. Villa then recovered the loose ball and centered to find Torres, whose shot was blocked. The teams seemed content with a draw that would have helped both, but Sweden was caught out when Capdevila sent a 40-meter pass over the head of Torres and into the path of Sweden defender Hansson. However, Hansson lost the ball under pressure from Villa, who calmly scored with an angled shot from just inside the area. ""We're happy. We had many chances in both halves and we managed to score right at the end,"" said Spain coach Luis Aragones. ""In the second half, we went out looking for the goal and things finally worked out."""

The cut will affect just 328,000 people and is expected to cost the government somewhere in the region of £400million. It means top earners will now pay 45p in tax for each pound they earn over £150,000. When Labour introduced the tax it was expected to raise £3bn for the Treasury but it has in fact raised just one-third of the forecast figure. Outlining the Budget for the next year, Mr Osborne said the cut would be financed by changes in stamp duty, the general anti-avoidance tax rule and a 'tycoon tax'. Mr Osborne said: 'No Chancellor can justify a tax rate that damages our economy and raises next to nothing. It is as simple as that. 'And thanks to the other new taxes on the rich I've announced today, we'll be getting five times more money each and every year from the wealthiest in our society. 'So the richest pay more. The economy benefits. Britain is competitive again.' Mr Miliband told Mr Osborne that voters would wonder which planet he and Prime Minister David Cameron are on. The Labour leader also challenged Cabinet ministers to raise their hands if they would personally benefit from cutting the 50p tax rate. Quoting back one of the Government's favourite mantras to promote transparency, he urged them: 'Sunlight is the best disinfectant. 'Just nod if you're going to benefit from it, or shake your head if you're not. Come on, we've got plenty of time.' How much higher rate earners will pay under the 45p rate compared with the 50p rate He said the Chancellor's 'driving ambitions' for the Budget were 'to deliver a tax cut for people earning over £150,000'. Mr Miliband added: 'How can the priority for our country be an income tax cut for the richest 1 per cent at a time when the squeezed middle are facing rising petrol prices, higher energy bills and tax credits and child benefit being cut? 'Think of what you could have done with the money.' Mr Miliband said Mr Osborne's growth plan had failed, adding: 'Unemployment is rising month upon month upon month. You promised us last year the deficit would be gone by the end of the Parliament, but today you admit you're borrowing over £150billion more than you said you would.' Dominic Swords from Henley Business School said: 'Unwinding that 50p down to 45p will have a bigger cost to total tax than he is expecting. Clearly it's a political decision that he's taken to be seen as the champion of enterprise. 'The net effect of the economics of it is a Robin Hood who is taking from the very wealthy to give to the quite wealthy.' The changes to stamp duty, which is a new 7per cent rate on homes worth more than £2m, will raise something like £500m alone. The government has insisted that it was essential to slash the top rate in order to build an enterprising economy, attract foreign investment and generate growth. Ahead of today's Budget, insiders said he believes there is a brief ‘window of opportunity’ to ditch the tax before the election run-in. George Osborne outlined changes to the 50p tax rate today which had met with some resistance from Lib Dem coalition colleagues such as Simon Hughes who said the issue was not one of his party's priorities The 50p tax, brought in by Labour, raised just a few hundred million pounds rather than the £2.5billion initially estimated. According to an ITV News-ComRes poll before today's Budget, 46 per cent of people were against the cutting of the 50p top tax rate while 31 per cent were in favour. The coalition have in recent days comes to an agreement over slashing to top rate, with the Lib Dems supporting it, as long as it came hand-in-hand with other measures to ensure the rich paid more tax. Simon Hughes, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, told the BBC on Monday that the issue was not one of the his party's priorities. 'We have our priority to make sure people at the top end of the income scale pay more and our priority is not to take tax rates down from the top,' he said. 'Our manifesto promise with which we went to the country was to lift people out of tax at the bottom by closing loopholes at the top. 'We did not say hang on to the 50p tax rate, or have a top tax rate at anything else.' Tax take: The chart above shows how individuals tax bills rise with their income. The bottom line is on current tax bands, while the top is inflation-adjusted with late 1970s tax bands The Chancellor had faced continued unease from his own benches over the cut in the tax rate which they believe is an inefficient means of generating revenue. Backbencher Jesse Norman said: 'I do think that the possibility of cutting the top rate is a concern. I don't think people will understand that this is being done in order to raise more money. 'The idea I don't think is going to get across without an enormous amount of communication,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One yesterday. Labour described the cut in the 50p rate as a 'wrong priority' that demonstrated 'just how out of touch this Government is'."

Leslie Sabo Jr., before he shipped out to fight in Vietnam. But from that month together in 1969 grew a lifetime of love. ""We got married in September, he got to come home that weekend, and we spent the night together, and he had to go back to Georgia the next day,"" Rose told CNN. After that, Sabo was off to training before returning home for 30 days that fall. ""We only had that one month together as a married couple,"" she told CNN. ""He left for Vietnam, and I never saw him again."" Obama awards Medal of Honor posthumously to Vietnam hero About seven months after the wedding, two soldiers knocked on the door of her home in western Pennsylvania to say he was missing in action. ""They came back to me five days later and told me that he was killed in action by enemy fire, and that was it. That's all I knew for 32 years."" There was a lot more to know, and now the nation is honoring what he did those decades ago. On Wednesday President Barack Obama will award Spec. Leslie Sabo Jr. the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor: What is it? Brown said her husband was fun-loving. ""The Leslie I knew was always goofing around, having fun. We had a ball together, my family adored him. Oh my gosh, my mother keeps saying, 'You couldn't have found anybody better than him to marry my daughter.'"" The people he fought with in the 101st Airborne Division told Rose that he knew when to put aside the goofing and focus on fighting. ""When he was over there, he wore a red bandanna,"" she said. ""And (his fellow soldiers) said when he put that red bandanna around his forehead, he meant business. He was a soldier. And they have a picture of him with that red bandanna on, and the title of it is 'The Soldier.'"" The Soldier's last stand, near the Se San River in Cambodia on May 10, 1970, is documented by the Department of Defense: ""Even though his platoon was ambushed from all sides by a large enemy force, Sabo charged the enemy position, killing several enemy Soldiers. He then assaulted an enemy flanking force, successfully drawing their fire away from friendly Soldiers and ultimately forcing the enemy to retreat. While securing a re-supply of ammunition, an enemy grenade landed nearby. Specialist Sabo picked it up, threw it, and shielded a wounded comrade with his own body -- absorbing the brunt of the blast and saving his comrade's life. ""Although wounded by the grenade blast, Sabo continued to charge the enemy's bunker. After receiving several serious wounds from automatic weapons fire, he crawled toward the enemy emplacement and, when in position, threw a grenade into the bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy fire, but also ended Specialist Sabo's life."" Comments: Who deserves a Medal of Honor? When Obama presents Rose Mary Sabo Brown with the medal on the pale blue ribbon, it will complete a circle that began 42 years ago right after her husband's death. His unit had recommended him for the Medal of Honor, but somehow it didn't happen. A researcher discovered files about Sabo, and now the earlier oversight has been corrected. Transcript: Obama's remarks at Medal of Honor ceremony For now, Brown is focused on her late husband and the medal he earned more than four decades ago. ""I've never stopped thinking about him,"" she said. ""My heart is filled with pride that you can't even imagine. It will be an honor to share this with anyone who wants to see it.""

Before what is now the traditional Saturday Royal Box audience of sporting aristocrats she went down 6-3 6-0 to the No 5 seed, who will be fancying her chances of another Wimbledon title on the 10th anniversary of her first. Although Sharapova admitted she was unaware who Sachin Tendulkar was in the privileged seats above her on Centre Court, Beckham is very familiar. They have much in common, being among the most commercially savvy high profile athletes of the modern age. Winner: Maria Sharapova beat Alison Riske in straight sets to reach the Wimbledon fourth round Determined look: Sharapova was in impressive form beating Riske 6-3 6-0 on Centre Court ‘I’ve actually met him a couple times at different events in L.A. and in London,’ she said. ‘He’s a great guy. Besides being an incredible football player, there is so much that he’s done in his career, having a family, maintaining so many things off the court. Really nice person to chat to. 'We’re not best buddies or anything, but it’s nice to be able to say hello and congratulate each other on achievements we’ve had in our careers and so on.’ Beckham would doubtless admire Sharapova’s idea of opening a sweet shop in Wimbledon Village for the duration of the tournament, and he shares with her an ability to compartmentalise the different aspects of sporting and business life. She enjoyed competing in front of others who have achieved in sport, even if she did not recognise many of them: ‘I always feel like I really understand them and actually get star struck more when I’m around athletes that have done incredible things in their careers, rather than maybe musicians.’ More on her mind is facing her next opponent, either Germany’s number nine seed Angelique Kerber and last year’s surprise semi-finalist, Kirsten Flipkens of Holland. It is one of tennis’s stranger facts of recent times that, having won it as a 17 year-old, Sharapova has never added to her tally of SW19 triumphs while managing two Grand Slams at the French Open on what used to be her weakest surface of clay. She is now looking to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2002 to pulling off the French Open and Wimbledon double in the same year. Hit and hope: American Riske was powerless to stop Sharapova who reeled off eleven games in a row Golden girl: Sharapova is bidding to win back-to-back grand slams following her French Open triumph in May The chances of her pulling that off rose slightly as she enjoyed a straightforward progression into the last 16 while her rivals had the tedium of sitting it out in the locker room waiting for the rain to subside. The Russian had the roof to thank for that, and she will not have been unhappy to have been in the temporarily sealed bubble anyway. Shutting out the elements is good for her game as there is less to interfere with her sometimes unreliable serve, which was in good working order. It will need to stay that way, as she is in what is very much the most difficult portion of the draw, full of potential threats. Faced with world number 44 Riske she got off to a slow start and was broken in the very first game, reviving memories of 12 months ago when she was bundled out of the second round here. ‘She has had some good results on grass, so I knew it was going to be a challenge,’ reflected Sharapova afterwards. Ultimately, though, it was a procession, as from 1-3 down she reeled off the next 11 games, accompanied by her trademark shriek that echoed around thanks to the roof. Riske was overmatched against this 2014 version of Sharapova that moves much better than the old one used to do. Coupled with the determination that has not been curtailed by so many millions in the bank, you could even see her going all the way next week.

However companies in the UAE have recently been positioning camel products as the stuff of luxury. Upscale department stores like London's Selfridge's now stock camel milk chocolate and it might not be long before camel milk ice cream, cheese, hot dogs -- and even camel leather handbags -- follow suit. ""Currently, we are exporting our camel milk to Kuwait, Jordan, Malaysia, Austria and the UK, with quite positive outcomes,"" says Mustasher Al Badry, the deputy general manager at Camelicious, one of the UAE's camel milk producers, and a brand owned by the Emirates Industry for Camel Milk & Products (EICMP). In the last few years, Camelicious' product line has exploded. They recently launched the world's first camel milk cheese, and their herd of camels has grown from a few hundred in 2006 to 4,200 as of today. Their sister company, Al Nassma, Dubai's own luxury brand of camel milk chocolate, recently developed camel milk gelato. ""We are pioneers in our field and pretty much anything we do is a 'first-time-ever,'"" says Al Badry. Other brands have started to capitalize on local camel-mania. Dubai coffee shop Cafe2Go made international headlines with its ""camelccinos"" and camel lattes, Italian style drinks made with camel milk. Camel meat also features prominently on the menu, which serves up camel fajitas, hot dogs, burgers and salami. Cafe2Go founder Jassim Al Bastaki also created a sub-brand called Camellos, which will stock Dubai's supermarkets with camel retail products, including meat (an industry first). ""I said, OK, let's go global with a camel revolution, and we'll enter as a pioneer of the camel cafÃ©,"" says Al Bastaki, who has franchised versions of Cafe2Go in Pakistan, Libya, Kenya, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Over the hump Camel is not the easiest product to work with. As a meat, it tends to be lean and tough -- not the most amenable for hot dogs and burgers. The milk is also half the fat of cow's milk -- a quality that makes it ideal for the health conscious but less so when you're concocting a recipe for chocolate. ""It's not easy for chocolate producers, because the fat does affect the taste,"" admits Martin Van Almsick, Al Nassma's general manager. ""We did a lot of trial and error in product development. We have really good, very experienced chocolate makers and without them we wouldn't have been able to overcome it, but we're over that hurdle."" Al Bastaki noted he had similar obstacles when crafting recipes from camel meat. In the end, he decided to mix the meat with fat from the hump to even out the consistency. Advocates of camel milk tend to cite its many health properties. Al Badry points out that camel milk is not only lower in fat than cow's milk, it's three- to five-times higher in vitamin C and easier to digest -- making it a suitable replacement for the lactose intolerant. This, he notes, is one reason the product has soared in popularity. The advent of camel products was given a boost last year when the European Union agreed to accept camel milk imports from the UAE (meat is still pending). Since then, Cameliscious has expanded its reach considerably. ""Camel milk is a product that is widely unknown in the markets we are aiming to enter, but awareness is steadily increasing,"" says Al Badry. ""We are very optimistic that our milk will convince through quality and health benefits. We are paving the way."""

The case is horrifying, maddening, grotesque. And -- perhaps worst of all -- there may be nothing Florida law enforcement can do about it. As the world now knows, the 17-year-old Martin walked to a store in Orlando to buy some snacks on the night of February 26. George Zimmerman, a volunteer Neighborhood Watch captain, thought the boy looked suspicious and called 911. The 911 operator told Zimmerman to keep his distance -- police would be sent -- but there was a confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin. Martin was killed with a single shot to the chest. Florida authorities have not arrested Zimmerman, and federal authorities recently joined the investigation. The legal question at the heart of the case involves Florida's so-called ""stand your ground"" law, which the legislature passed, at the behest of the National Rifle Association, in 2005. Before that time, Florida law resembled that of most other states; during confrontations, individuals had a duty to retreat rather than to respond to provocations. Under the new law, a person is allowed to use deadly force if he is in a place he has a right to be and feels reasonably threatened with serious harm. Weigh in on the Trayvon Martin case, share your thoughts on iReport In this case, then, the question is whether Zimmerman was in such a place and felt reasonably threatened. The 911 operator told Zimmerman to keep his distance from Martin, but Zimmerman had a right to be on the street. That's where neighborhood watch volunteers work. Clearly, the question at the heart of the case is whether Zimmerman reasonably felt threatened. On this issue, the evidence currently seems murky. There appears to have been some sort of confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin. Police found Zimmerman with an injury to his head. Most important -- and most tragic -- the police will hear only one side of the story about this confrontation. Trayvon is not around to tell his story. The continuing investigation will surely focus on finding other witnesses. The facts of this case show why the ""stand your ground"" law is so important. The law focuses on the subjective understanding of the shooter. Was his understanding of the situation ""reasonable""? Ultimately, that would be a question for the jury to decide, but it still gives a lot of deference to the perpetrator of a violent act. The new law even allows a disproportionate response; if someone comes at you with a fist, you can reply with a gun. In light of the shift in the law, it's not surprising that since the law went into effect, reports of justifiable homicides have tripled, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Another case under litigation in Florida highlights the effect of the law. In September 2010, David James was playing basketball with his 8-year-old daughter on an outdoor court in Valrico. A boy was skateboarding on the court at the same time, and Trevor Dooley, a man who lived in the area, told the boy he shouldn't be skateboarding there. James stood up for the boy, and he and Dooley had a confrontation. Dooley was carrying a gun and wound up shooting James dead. Dooley asserted that he felt threatened by James, and has asked that the case be dismissed before trial under the ""stand your ground"" law. (The judge will soon make a ruling.) In both of these cases -- in the deaths of both James and Martin -- the legal defense for the shooters appears to rely almost completely on the ""stand your ground"" law. In the death of David James, prosecutors are doing their best against tough odds. In the death of Trayvon Martin, it's prosecutors who are taking the heat for failing, thus far, to bring any charges against George Zimmerman. But this outrage, understandable though it is, might be directed somewhere else as well. The Florida legislators who voted for the ""stand your ground"" law -- and Gov. Jeb Bush, who signed it -- have something to answer for as well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Toobin."

And one of the unexpected benefits of sticking to a rations' diet has been the cost of Louise's shopping - which has dropped to just £10 a week. She said: 'I have always wanted to do it. 'I am obsessed with the 1940s and 1950s.  I decided to do it after seeing how much food everyone buys at Christmas. Louise admits she used to 'buy everything going' but realised the huge difference in lifestyles when she watched a wartime programme on TV. 'I watched the BBC Wartime Farm Christmas special and saw how they came together as a community. It is so different how we used to do Christmas,' she said. 'It has made me realise how much money I waste on food. I have hardly spent anything. 'I am so used to convenience and just grabbing something out of the freezer or ringing for a takeaway. 'I feel 10 times better for it. I don't think I want to go back to eating as much as I used to, but I am looking forward to having something stodgy and a glass of wine. Forgotten dishes such as Woolton pie, mince slices and corn beef pie, feature heavily in her meals The occupational therapist prepares wartime meals like bean medley (left) and corn beef hash (right) Louise got 2015 off to a good start by using her 16-point monthly allowance to buy a tin of corned beef and ditching the alcohol - which was hard to come by in those days. The challenge has meant that she must concentrate her allowances - a tin of Spam would cost eight points - although that hasn't seen her lacking for food. Rations for the month have included meat, butter, cheese, margarine, cooking fat, milk, sugar, preserves, tea, eggs and sweets. And while at first glance the list might not look that bad, Ms Rhucroft's 50 grams of cheese and three pints of milk have to last her a week. Ms Rhucroft says she 'decided to do it after seeing how much food everyone buys at Christmas' Ms Rhucroft said: 'I have had the good, old corned beef, but I have avoided the Spam so far. 'I have also eaten a lot of vegetables and a lot of soup.' So far, her favourite meal has been fish cakes in which she uses  cod, mashed potato a carrot and half a rasher of bacon to make. The bean medley - made up mainly of 84 grams haricot beans, a teaspoon of treacle, 141 grams of mixed vegetables and 14 grams of chopped bacon - is her worst meal. 'I hate baked beans, so I don't know why I thought I would give it a try,' she said. 'But in those days you would not have been able to waste it, so I have fought my way through, even if I hated eating it.' Louise will be continuing with her challenge until 29 January.To donate, visit www.justgiving.com/Louise-Rhucroft1.

The Frenchman finished five clear of compatriot Jérôme Lando Casanova on 12 under par thanks to a three under closing 69 on Saturday, a feat which ensured he became the first player in Challenge Tour history to win three titles in one season on two separate occasions. Few could question the serene way in which Hebert went about his business on the final day, as he built an unassailable lead thanks to five birdies and just two dropped shots, meaning attention soon turned to the battle for a place in an increasingly fluid top 15 on the Rankings. Benjamin Hebert (centre) is congratulated by his fellow players after his third Challenge Tour win of the season Andrew Johnston (above) secured his place as Challenge Tour number one, earning his European Tour card The Challenge Tour's closing event of the season was held at the picturesque Al Badia golf club in Dubai While Andrew Johnston rubber-stamped his title as the 2014 Challenge Tour Number One with a top ten finish after a level par final round of 72, it was all happening further down the list as dreams were made and hearts were broken. For much of the day it had looked like Dane Lasse Jensen had done enough to earn his place amongst the graduating class, but five dropped shots in as many holes around the turn put paid to his chances and left the way clear for the charging Lando Casanova, who hit light speed on the final day in Dubai. The Frenchman started the week with a six over par 78 in the opening round, but a fantastic run over the closing three rounds culminated in a final round 69, which meant he climbed 25 places in the Rankings to 13th place. It was not all plain sailing for the 29 year old though, thanks to a bogey at the 17th which had seen him drop out of the reckoning for promotion, but a birdie at the last saw him vault back in. He would have to wait anxiously by as Oliver Farr played the last, but when the Welshman hit his tee shot in the water, Lando Casanova's graduation was all but secure. As for his compatriot Hebert, he was just pleased to sign off the season in such a positive manner, as he prepares for a second crack at the big time next year. Oliver Farr (centre) of Wales finished third in the tournament, also earning his European Tour playing rights As The Challenge Tour drew to a close for 2014 in Dubai, here are the top 15 players who have earned a playing card and promotion to the illustrious European Tour: 1st: Andrew Johnston (England) 2nd: Benjamin Hebert (France) 3rd: Byeong-hun An (South Korea) 4th: Moritz Lampert (Germany) 5th: Mark Tullo (Chile) 6th: Sam Hutsby (England) 7th: Jordi Garcia Pinto (Spain) 8th: Jason Palmer (England) 9th: Michael Lorenzo-Vera (France) 10th: Oliver Farr (Wales) 11th: Edouard Espana (France) 12th: Florian Fritsch (Germany) 13th: Jerome Lando Casanova (France) 14th: Jake Roos (South Africa) 15th: Jason Barnes (England) 'It is a perfect end to the season for sure,' said the 27 year old. 'I played very well the last three months, but this is a great feeling. I always practice hard and keep myself positive in the bad times, but now everything is OK, and we will have a lot of fun over the next week before I start practicing to improve my game for The European Tour. 'My game is much better than the last time I graduated, but sometimes I still feel so-so on the course, and I have a few bad stretches which I want to fix. If I can sort that out then I feel I can perform well next season. 'It was a hard day, with the wind getting up at the end of the round, but I stayed focused with my caddie and played it shot-by-shot. I had some good birdies on the 14th and 15th which gave me a good advantage, and over the last two holes I was just patient up until the end. 'My goal will be to keep my card next year. I have won six times on the Challenge Tour, but now I want to win on The European Tour. Winning three times in two different seasons has never been done before, which is a great achievement, but I would exchange all of those for one win on The European Tour. 'I'm going to keep it the same for next year, stay focused and play my game, and we'll see what happens. I had a good winter last year, and I want the same this time around, so if I can do that then it will be OK for next year.' Alessandro Tadini (centre) of Italy finished fifth in Dubai, but it was not enough to earn a European Tour card Mortiz Lampert (centre) on his way to finishing fourth in the tournament and fifth in the overall rankings Lando Casanova may sound like a fictional villain from a Disney movie, but the man with one of the best names in golf proved he is more than just an impressive moniker. His form over the final 54 holes was nothing short of miraculous, and in every way deserving of a starting berth in The Race to Dubai for 2015. 'It hasn't sunk in yet, but it is the first time in my career I am happy to be second,' said the Cannes resident. 'On the 18th, watching (Oliver) Farr was the longest time of my life, and really, I don't know what to say as I can't quite believe it. Maybe when I put my tee in the ground on the first hole on The European Tour, then I will believe it. 'It feels great, but we'll see how it goes next year. I'm so excited to get out there as soon as I can, and I can't wait to get home and rest with my family and friends and stop golf for a while. For the moment I don't care about the schedule for next year, I just want to rest.' Farr might not have realised the effect his play on the final hole would have had on so many players' careers, but regardless of his crucial bogey at the last to card a closing 73 and finish six adrift of Hebert, the Welshman will be elated with a third place finish that guarantees a maiden sojourn on The European Tour at the end of an impressive rookie season. In fourth was the ever-consistent Byeong-hun An (68) who has long been assured of a place on The Race to Dubai in 2015, while Hugues Joannes (70) and Alessandro Tadini (71) rounded out the top five. The players who earned their European Tour playing rights for 2015 celebrate at the end of the tournament In the Rankings, Antonio Hortal was the unfortunate one to miss out in the dreaded 16th spot on the season-long list, after he fell to a 78 on Saturday. Ben Evans (72) had briefly climbed into the top 15 at the end of his round after Lando Casanova's bogey at the penultimate hole, but the Frenchman's crucial four at the last knocked the Englishman back down to 17th. There was also disappointment for Jensen (77), who had entered the final day inside the top 15 on the provisional list, but eventually missed out. As for top spot, Johnston always looked like he had it under control having entered the week with a substantial lead, and his tie for ninth at the end of 72 holes in Dubai ensured a return to The European Tour in 2015 thanks to earnings of €190,856 this season, the highest winning total since Edoardo Molinari in 2009."

Dozens of potential buyers attended the auction at the Grand Palais (Great Palace) in Paris, all of them hoping to get their hands on the 1,585cc Dyna Super Glide. It was given to Pope Francis last June as a gift from Harley-Davidson to mark the American company's 110th anniversary. Pope Francis announced he was selling one of his two Harley Davidson motorbikes and hopes to raise £12,000 for charity. But it fetched more than £200,000 at auction The pontiff was given two bikes and a leather jacket by Harley Davidson to celebrate their 110th anniversary The Pontiff later donated the motorbike to the Caritas Roma charity, which works on behalf of the Catholic Church to support the poor. Now all the money raised will go on renovating a hostel and a soup kitchen in the Italian capital. The superbike, which has the signature 'Francis' on its petrol tank, was expected to fetch between around £10,000 and £12,000, but an anonymous phone buyer was successful with a 241,500 euro bid - the equivalent of just over £200,000. At the time the Pope laid his hands on a disabled Angel during the open blessing in the Vatican City A 'Pope' leather biker jacket which accompanied the motorbike also sold for £41,000. Numerous potential buyers were turned away because there were too many for the auction house to cope. Before the bike went on the hammer, Ben Walker, of British auction house Bonhams said: 'We are incredibly honoured to be selling this item on behalf of Caritas Roma. 'We hope to be able to do both Pope Francis and Harley-Davidson proud by raising a significant amount of money for a very worthy cause.' Pope Francis, 77, is not thought to have ridden the Harley - a brand more commonly associated with Hell's Angel gangs."

As the former England captain prepares to pack his bags and head for Major League Soccer, an astonishing stat has emerged: Gerrard has played Chelsea 39 times in his Liverpool career, but has managed just one goal against them. It came in the Premier League in 2005, when a 25-year-old Gerrard, fresh from lifting a Champions League trophy five months earlier, netted to level the match at 1-1. Steven Gerrard has played against Chelsea 39 times in his Liverpool career, but has only scored one goal Gerrard led Liverpool to the Capital One Cup semi-final this season, but they were knocked out on Tuesday Frank Lampard had put Jose Mourinho's side 1-0 up from the penalty spot before Gerrard's leveller, but even his one goal against them did not end in success as Damien Duff, Joe Cole and substitute Geremi made it a day to forget for Liverpool as they crashed 4-1. The previous February, Gerrard had scored a goal for Chelsea in the League Cup final in Cardiff. After John Arne Riise's early strike, the captain's unfortunate deflection from a Paulo Ferreira free-kick saw him on the scoresheet for all the wrong reasons, and his day was made worse by Chelsea's eventual extra-time win. Gerrard scored an own goal against Chelsea in the Carling Cup final at Cardiff in February 2005 The Liverpool captain diverted a Paulo Ferreira free-kick into his own net as Chelsea won the match 3-2 No goals against the Blues in the following decade have resulted in a rather unfortunate record that is likely to stay with Gerrard for the rest of his career. Tuesday night saw him take to the field against Chelsea for the 39th time, but he was unable to stop an extra-time winner from Branislav Ivanovic, ending his hopes of lifting the Capital One Cup at Wembley in March. Now, the FA Cup represents Gerrard's final chance to lift a trophy in Liverpool colours.

Cease-fires between Hamas-ruled Gaza and Israel have brought security for months on end and there is ample evidence to show that Israel is largely responsible for truce breakdowns. Israel decided to escalate the conflict last Wednesday with its assassination of Hamas leader Ahmed al-Ja'abari despite a truce that had been observed by all Palestinian factions during the previous two days. Read more on CNNArabic And even though they knew that al-Ja'abari had just received a proposal for a permanent truce agreement with Israel, as revealed in Haaretz. Some analysts have tied Israel's latest operation to the forthcoming elections, a way of cementing victory for Benjamin Netanyahu. Previous prime ministers have tried it, and failed. Netanyahu had previously avoided such operations but he seems to have succumbed, although events can spiral out of his control, as Hamas hits near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem have shown. But at the end of the day, the loss of Palestinian lives will far exceed that of Israelis. During Israel's last major operation against Gaza, the devastating three-week assault it launched on December 27, 2008 despite a cease-fire that had held for months, nearly 1,400 Palestinians were killed and thousands injured, compared to 13 Israelis (four from friendly fire.) In the present attacks, more than 100 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed so far. CNN Poll: 57% of Americans say Israeli attacks in Gaza are justified The loss of life in armed conflict is always tragic, and much more so when those lives could have been spared by a cease-fire. What is particularly heartbreaking about the population in Gaza, against the backdrop of broader Palestinian dispossession, is that they have nowhere to run. CNN iReport: Share your images but stay safe. Israel's blockade is now into its seventh year, while the new Egyptian government has not yet significantly opened Gaza's only non-Israeli border crossing at Rafah. There are arguably two other factors behind Israel's new operation. One is deterrence, as Gabi Siboni, an Israeli colonel emphasized in The New York Times: ""Deterrence has to be maintained. It was only a question of time until this moment arrived."" Put differently, Israel will ignore any cease-fire at will. Blogger Jerry Haber recalls his conversation with an Israeli military expert shortly after Operation Cast Lead who said that Israel deliberately provoked Hamas rocket fire so it could do a little ""spring cleaning"" and deplete Hamas's weapons. He said this happened every few years. And here we are, four years on. The second reason for the attacks on Gaza is that Israel may be testing the boundaries of the changes brought about by the Arab uprisings to see just how far it can push the U.S., Egypt, and the Palestinian leadership. Read related: How Middle East has changed since last Gaza conflict There is clearly no change from the U.S., whose spokespersons unquestioningly supported Israel's right to ""self-defense."" By contrast, Egypt's Mohammed Morsi unreservedly condemned the attack, sending his prime minister and other officials to Gaza to effectively serve as human shields: An Israeli attack on the officials would have meant a real rupture with Egypt. The signals from the Palestinian Authority (PA) have been mixed. PA security forces have brutally cracked down on some of the demonstrations protesting Israel's assault on Gaza as part of their security coordination with Israel. At the same time, PA head Mahmoud Abbas has been urging Arab and international action to bring about an end to the fighting and speaking of reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas. With the impending bid to upgrade the status of the Palestinian territories at the United Nations to that of non-member observer state, the PA and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) cannot abandon Gaza to its fate. This is a sharp reversal of PLO behavior during Operation Cast Lead in 2009, when it resisted attempts to bring about an immediate cease-fire so as to please the U.S. -- so much so that the then-president of the U.N. General Assembly, the Nicaraguan priest Father Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, effectively accused them of complicity though without naming names. Read latest: Reports from CNN on the ground in the Gaza-Israel conflict Four years on, the PLO/PA has little faith in the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution and none in Israel's. In any case, the PLO/PA cannot afford to be seen to be less pro-Palestinian than Egypt. Even the U.S. may not be able to completely ignore Arab sentiments in an era of disappearing dictatorships. What is needed now is an immediate cease-fire, pushed by Palestinian and Arab leaders and supported by the international community, whether Israel wants it or not. It is imperative to end the bloodshed now, and then work for a just peace that will end it for all time."

Former England player Phil Neville has been criticised for his co-commentary by fans and celebrities on Twitter South Warwickshire police joined others on Twitter mocking BBC co-commentator Phil Neville The force tweeted jokes about him as part of its safety campaign during the late-night match Saturday was Neville’s first appearance as the Corporation’s new star pundit, and could prove to be his last after a brisk Twitter backlash. While England’s players ran Italy close on the pitch, Neville appeared to be out of his depth in the commentary box. Fans made fun of his robotic voice and dull insights, with some asking if he could be hauled off at half-time. He will be absent from England’s next two group games, which will be broadcast on ITV. However, the BBC has refused to say whether Neville would return if the team makes the knock-out rounds. The former England player, providing co-commentary alongside BBC regular Guy Mowbray, was compared by one viewer to the computer HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Another suggested he would be better off presenting the Shipping Forecast. Former Liverpool and Germany star Didi Hamann was among the stars criticising Neville's commentary Despite also working for the BBC, comedian Danny Baker joined the backlash against the former player Jokes about Neville lightened the evening for England fans, as the team slipped to a 2-1 defeat Broadcaster Mary Ann Sieghart branded the former Everton midfielder's voice 'talking Temazepam' He was even mocked by the police, with the South Warwickshire force’s official Twitter feed providing a string of safety advice based on his disastrous performance. ‘At least we know Phil Neville won’t stir the crowds in the pubs into a frenzy. Drink sensibly,’ read one message, while another claimed officers ‘will be playing recordings of Phil Neville all night to keep the streets all calm and sleepy’. Some fans asked whether it was possible to fire a commentator at half-time, while former Liverpool midfielder Didier Hamann wrote: ‘If Phil Neville reads his Twitter feed he may not come out for the second half.’ More than 13million viewers stayed up until the final whistle, just before 1am yesterday morning. The Corporation could not yet say how many viewers complained about Neville’s commentary, as weekend figures only become available on Mondays. Some fans linked physio Gary Lewin's injury to Neville's dull performance in the commentary box Tottenham MP David Lammy joked that, with such a dull voice, Neville may have a future in politics Neville was signed up by the BBC after retiring from Everton last year and regularly appears on Match of the Day Part of the team: Neville is part of the BBC team of pundits and co-commentators for the World Cup It stressed that Neville had received training before being allowed on-air but, when asked whether he would return for the BBC’s next live England game, a spokesman said: ‘Everything for the final 16 will be decided much closer to the time.’ Critics suggested Neville’s appointment showed the folly of the BBC favouring ‘big names’ over seasoned professionals for its punditry team. Luckily, Neville – the brother of England assistant coach Gary – seems to have taken the comments in good spirits. He tweeted last night: ‘Sometimes you have to take the criticism – it will only make me better. Thanks for the feedback (ahhahaha)!’ The BBC gave England’s fans false hope after just a few minutes, when its on-screen graphic incorrectly put England 1-0 up. The blunder came after Raheem Sterling thumped a shot at goal from 30 yards that appeared to fly into the top corner. ‘Goal’ flashed up on the BBC’s coverage, and the score in the corner of the screen was changed to ‘ENG 1-0 ITA’ – but viewers were bemused to see Sterling fail to celebrate after such an excellent strike. In truth, Sterling’s shot was off-target, with the net only bulging because the ball had hit the side netting. The BBC swiftly rectified their error."

The wife of disgraced former Governor, Bob McDonnell, is due to be sentenced later this month for her part in illegally accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans. He has already been handed a two-year prison term but remains free during his appeal. In it together: A jury found Bob and Maureen McDonnell guilty of public corruption after they illegally accepted $165,000 in gifts and loans from vitamin entrepreneur Jonnie Williams Prosecutors and defense lawyers filed memos arguing their positions ahead of McDonnell's sentencing on February 20. Her lawyers have argued she should be sentenced to probation and 4,000 hours of community service, while prosecutors said she was a 'full participant' in the crime. 'Because Mrs McDonnell was a full participant in a bribery scheme that sold the Governor's office in exchange for luxury goods and sweetheart loans, many of which she solicited personally, and because she repeatedly attempted to thwart the investigation through false representations, it would be unjust for her not to serve a period of incarceration for her crimes,' documents said. Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell was sentenced to two years after his conviction for public corruption. Prosecutors want his wife Maureen to be given 18-months while her lawyers call for probation Last year, a jury found McDonnell and his wife guilty of illegally accepting high-value gifts including a Rolex watch, designer clothing, vacations and loans from wealthy vitamin entrepreneur Jonnie Williams, in exchange for promoting his products. Williams testified under immunity as the prosecution's star witness in a case that exposed the details of the McDonnells' shaky finances and troubled marriage. McDonnell testified in his own defense during the six-week trial, acknowledging that he accepted Williams' handouts but did nothing for him in return other than extend routine political courtesies. He was convicted of 11 counts. U.S. District Judge James R. Spencer surprised many legal experts last month when he sentenced former Gov. Bob McDonnell to only two years, well below the 10 sought by prosecutors."

The club have estimated revenues will fall this season by between £38million and £48m - a drop of between 8.77 per cent and 11 per cent on last season's overall revenue figure of £433m - as a result of not being in Europe.

Wayne Rooney and Co's failure to qualify for the Champions League will hit the club's revenue Both the income streams from broadcasting revenue and matchday revenue - which were both £19.3m for the first quarter of the 2013-14 financial year - can expect to take a hit. Broadcasting revenue will suffer due to no money at all coming in from UEFA - it was worth €44.7million (£35.7m) to United in 2013-14 - while matchday income will be affected because there will be no European matches compared to 10 last season which were worth around £20m combined.

""It was a difficult decision for some countries, but it was necessary and right to reinforce international efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Syria,"" he said in a written statement. The violence continued in the war-torn nation as bloody children were rushed into a dirty makeshift clinic in the Syrian city of Qusayr. Qusayr, near the border with Lebanon, is a strategic area where food, medicine and other supplies are hustled along routes used by government fighters and those trying to oust the government. CNN talked via Skype on Monday with a citizen journalist who described a desperate and horrid situation. The main hospital in Qusayr has been obliterated by fighting, the source said, not wishing to be named out of concern for security. The wounded are being crammed into homes. And, as one YouTube video shows, they apparently being treated at a makeshift clinic. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video. It's hard to watch. A boy wearing a purple shirt comes in screaming, his head bloody. The camera closes in on a baby. The child wails as people holding a steel instrument trying to dislodge something from the child's ear. The walls are smeared with blood. Catherine Ashton, EU High representative, announced the end of the embargo, reading a declaration from the organization's Foreign Affairs Council. Part of it states: ""With regard to the possible export of arms to Syria, the Council took note of the commitment by Member States to proceed in their national policies as follows: The sale, supply, transfer or export of military equipment or of equipment which might be used for internal repression will be for the Syrian National Coalition for Opposition and Revolutionary Forces and intended for the protection of civilians."" In Geneva, the United Nations' human rights commissioner spoke as she has several times before during the two-year war in Syria. Navi Pillay, in opening remarks at the first session of the U.N. Human Rights Council's three-week conference, said the situation has deteriorated to an ""intolerable affront to the human conscience,"" and the International Criminal Court must mete out justice to those who've violated the rights of Syrians. ""I feel utter dismay,"" she said. Read Navi Pillay's full remarks to the rights council Pillay reminded listeners that the war in Syria began in March 2011 as a peaceful demonstration against President Bashar al-Assad and has devolved into a complicated bloodbath of sect battles and terrorist fighters. ""Whenever their governments cannot or will not protect them, frightened human beings are dependent on the international community for protection and assistance,"" she said. ""We cannot -- we must not -- continue to ignore their plea."" Amid the backdrop of the Geneva conference came word that Sen. John McCain was inside Syria on Monday and met with rebels, making him the highest ranking U.S. official to visit during the war. The senator's communications director, Brian Rogers, confirmed the trip. Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director for the Washington-based Syrian Emergency Task Force, said McCain met with 18 commanders of the Free Syrian Army about 1 kilometer from the border with Turkey in northern Syria. ""Their main message was that we are desperate for ammunition, we are desperate for weapons,"" Moustafa said. ""They are confident that if the weapons are given to the supreme military council, that it will not fall in the wrong hands."" McCain met with the commanders, which included the top leader of the rebel force, for about an hour. It's often difficult to discern exactly what is happening Syria because al-Assad has made it difficult if not deadly for foreign journalists to enter the nation. A state TV reporter, Yara Abbas, was killed in Qusayr on Monday, according to Syria state television. She died after ""terrorists targeted"" a state TV crew near al-Dabaa airport north of the strategic city near Lebanon, where rebels and government forces run supply routes. In Geneva, Pillay talked about Qusayr. ""I am extremely concerned at current reports suggesting that hundreds of civilians have been killed or injured, and thousands may remain trapped, by indiscriminate shelling and aerial attacks by government forces in Al Qusayr,"" Pillay said. Safe passage must be given to any civilians wishing to leave."" Outside reports indicate rebels continue to fight for the cause that began the unrest: ousting al-Assad and allowing Syrians greater freedom, something akin to the goals of the wider Arab Spring movement. Those who want al-Assad gone claim that the president has ordered his forces to slay families and indiscriminately shell neighborhoods across the country, which is about the size of Washington state. Al-Assad says his forces are trying to save the country from ""terrorists."" ""These war crimes and crimes against humanity cannot be allowed to go unpunished,"" Pillay told delegates from around the world. ""We must make it clear to both (the Assad government) and the armed opposition groups that there will be consequences for those responsible. And the world must take action to end this terrible conflict."" Pillay's remarks came as U.S. Secretary John Kerry met in Paris with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The two diplomats spoke briefly to reporters Monday before heading off to a private dinner with the French foreign minister. Kerry expressed concern about any possible use of chemical weapons and the need to determine what is happening on the ground, while Lavrov stressed the situation in Syria isn't getting any better and that he wants to do everything in his power to stop the bloodshed. For months during the Syrian war, Russia appeared to be supporting al-Assad. But that tide may be turning, at least gaining some wiggle room for the Russians to help broker an end to the violence. CNN's Security Clearance: Russia blasts Obama's recognition of rebels U.S. officials want to start talks between the government and groups that want al-Assad gone. But not everyone involved in Syria wants to engage. The Syrian National Council, based in Istanbul, is part of the main opposition umbrella group and is considered to be composed of hardliners who've said they'll never talk or negotiate with anyone representing the Assad regime. The group was having meetings over the weekend in Istanbul to consider attending the Geneva conference. Syrian National Coalition spokesman Louay Safi said the group wants to hear ""more clarity about the purpose and the intentions of the Syrian regime. ""So far,"" he said, ""the signals have been not positive."" At the start of May, the U.N.'s point man on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, called Lavrov and Kerry's cooperation to forge a solution to the Syrian conflict ""the first hopeful news concerning that unhappy country in a very long time."" Lavrov told Foreign Policy recently that the United States and Russia have a lot in common. Asked about his ""famously contentious relationship"" with Bush administration Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Lavrov laughed. ""Well, I don't engage in comparing my partners,"" he said. ""John Kerry is a professional. He is pragmatic. And this is a very important quality for a diplomat and especially for a secretary of state. ""He has very good knowledge of things around the world. He has keen interest in moving some of the old problems out of the deadlock."" Lavrov also was asked about Kerry's criticism that Russia is still selling weapons to Syria. ""Well, you know on the arms sales, we never, we never tried to hide that we are implementing the contracts which have been signed quite some time ago, long before all this started,"" he answered, saying his country has provided Syria with defensive weapons. ""We have been consistent,"" he told Foreign Policy. ""We have been saying that for us priority No. 1 is to stop the bloodshed and to save lives, and therefore cessation of hostilities and dialogue without any preconditions is the best way to achieve this desired goal."" While diplomats talked, on Monday at least 35 people were killed in Syria, including two women and two children, according to the opposition group Local Coordination Committees in Syria.

Father-of-four Dr Mohammad Tariquezzaman - known as Dr Zaman - performed an 'unnecessary' internal examination when the 20-year-old woman arrived at University College Hospital, London, complaining of stomach pains. The 51-year-old 'smirked' as he watched her undress, pulled her knickers down to her thighs and commented on her appearance during the 20-minute appointment. When the woman, known only as Patient A, told him she felt uncomfortable, he laughed and said: ‘This isn’t the first time this has been done to you.’ Zaman, who has worked in Britain for 18 years, also took her phone number, asked whether she had a boyfriend and invited her out for an Indian meal. The patient's mother, a nurse, contacted police after her daughter told her about the examination at the hands of Zaman. The doctor, who also worked at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in Putney, south west London, was cleared of sexual assault by penetration after a trial at Blackfriars Crown Court in December 2011. But he was struck by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel after they found him guilty of sexual misconduct. The panel told Zaman that the examination was 'unnecessary' and his actions were sexually motivated. The devout Muslim had asked the MPTS panel to suspend him for a year. But  chairman Dr Vicki Harris told him: ‘The panel could not be confident that you had no attitudinal problems in light of your smirking, laughter and inappropriate comments to your patient during the internal vaginal examination. ‘Your actions were clearly deplorable and your breaches of Good Medical Practice [professional guidelines] were particularly serious. ‘They eroded the trust that patients are entitled to have in doctors. Notwithstanding the testimonials and the mitigation that you advanced, in particular that relating to the financial and personal consequences of erasure, the panel has concluded that your misconduct is so serious that it is fundamentally incompatible with continued registration.’ She added: ‘The panel concluded that your extensive and material breaches of professional standards were so serious that it is necessary to erase your name from the medical register. ‘It considered this to be the only means by which it could meet its obligation to protect patients and satisfy the wider public interest.’ Zaman had denied the allegations, insisting he was not attracted to black girls, but the fitness the panel preferred the evidence of his victim. The accounting and finance student said she had gone to hospital suffering abdominal pain after falling ill during while working part-time in a clothes shop. She attended the accident and emergency department and was seen by Zaman, who was working as a locum senior house officer at the time. He also suggested she should go to his private practice in Putney for free, even though there was no clinical reason for her to do so, the tribunal found. Sexual misconduct: The victim, referred to as Patient A, arrived at University College Hospital in south London complaining of stomach pains and was subjected to an 'unnecessary' internal examination by Zaman Zaman told her to get undressed, but failed to offer her a chaperone or provide her with any privacy, it was found. Giving evidence, Patient A said: ‘He examined around my navel, the left side and the other parts of my abdomen. That was what he examined before the internal examination.’ She continued: ‘When he was doing the internal exam my eyes were closed because I thought it was uncomfortable. ‘It was kind of embarrassing so my eyes were closed and I opened my eyes whilst it was going on and that’s when I saw he was looking at me.’ She told the panel that Zaman smirked and laughed when she told him she felt uncomfortable and, referring to her boyfriend, said: ‘This isn’t the first time this has been done to you.’ Patient A added: ‘I did tell him I felt uncomfortable at the time and I was in a lot of pain and up until he said a certain comment and I realised where the consultation was going I honestly did think he was examining me. Delporable: The father-of-four also invited the female patient for a free consultation at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in Putney, south west London ‘From what he was saying and the way he was talking I realised that he was not examining me and by then it was too late for me to do anything. It’s not in my character to make a big scene or scream.’ When he had finished the procedure he joked: ‘Everything’s fine, you’re clean.’ She said: ‘He said he would contact me and he also mentioned something about an Indian restaurant and trying to find out if I was available the next day or the day afterwards.’ Zaman continues to deny the panel’s findings and says he is being ‘crucified for a sin I have not done at all’ He had been subject to a string of conditions since March 2010, one of which prevented him from conducting intimate examinations without a chaperone, except in life-threatening situations. Zaman now has 28 days to appeal the decision. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."

Beijing resident Chen Xiao decided to put her life up for sale after an unhappy 2008. ""It's your right to arrange Chen Xiao's life, and it's my obligation to serve you,"" read her online shop. Since December, Chen has been allowing others to decide what she will do each day, because, for the most part, last year was awful, she said. Her hometown was hit by blizzards, her country rocked by a devastating earthquake, friends divorced and her clothing shop went bankrupt. ""Every time I had a plan for what I wanted my life to be like, nothing would come of it. It was very disappointing. I figured if other people came up with things for me to do, I might stumble upon something new and better,"" she told CNN. What she stumbled upon was not only a new life but a new way to make a living. She charges about $3 an hour, and she's been asked to do almost everything from delivering pet food to caring for stray cats to taking a hot lunch to a homeless man. What surprised her the most was not so much the varied requests but being able to find happiness in the process. ""If somebody asks you to do something, something simple, and you do it, it can make you very happy. You can change from a gloomy person to a very bright one. It can help give you a new sense of self-esteem,"" she said. So far, the most meaningful assignment she was given was attending a child's birth -- the father was a complete stranger who just wanted someone to take pictures and share the moment. There are limits to what she will agree to do. She will not do anything illegal, immoral or violent, but she said that has not stopped some from asking. ""When I first started there was this man who would send me these really disgusting text messages. His words were over the top... nauseating,"" she said. There was also a man who wanted to meet her for a few private hours at a ski chalet. When she turned up with a friend to take photographs, he backed out and then demanded a refund, but Chen refused. In many ways she is just a glorified errand girl, but with a unique China twist. Chen is another example here of how in China the Internet is crossing over from cyberspace to the real world. Chen does not know how much longer she will keep taking cyberrequests. For now it is a good way to survive the financial crisis when many others are losing their jobs and businesses are going broke. ""When people stop needing me, I'll go back to my original life. But I don't know what will come,"" she said. China's netizens will most likely make that decision for her as well."

The threat of accidental incest was all-too real for three Icelandic software designers who have created a smartphone app that aims to prevent exactly such sticky situations by informing people precisely how closely related they really are. The online Iselandingabok database - which helps Icelanders to trace their family history - had already been set up by anti-virus software developer Friðrik Skúlason.

""We announce that we have signed Fabio Cannavaro for two years,"" Abdullah Al Nabooda, chairman of Al Ahli's board of directors said. ""This deal with a player like Cannavaro is one of the most important deals for us because he's a player with great experience and talent, while he's also a leader on the field."" Cannavaro -- who has 132 caps for his country and led the Italians to victory over France in the 2006 World Cup final -- is planning to retire from international football after the South African tournament, which will be his fourth. He played at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before moving to Juventus in 2009, and had hoped to earn a deal with his hometown club Napoli, where he began his career. ""The option to extend my deal with Juventus has expired. I want Napoli, but they don't want me,"" he told Italian sports paper Tuttosport last week. However, Cannavaro said he was now happy to make the move to the Middle-East. ""I am happy to sign for Al Ahli for the next season. I was already planning to go and live in Dubai, I love that city. It's a dream come true,"" he told Italian newspaper La Gazetta dello Sport. Meanwhile, British media have speculated that Al Ahli is also interested in signing manager Harry Redknapp, 63, from London-based English Premier League side Tottenham next season."

Blisse Mellens, two, suffers from a rare medical condition where any sudden noise could trigger an epileptic fit. Her mother Laura and father Ashley watch their every movement, sneeze or cough to make sure their daughter isn’t startled by noise. Blisse Mellens with her mother Laura, father Ashley, and elder sister Nevaeh. Mrs Mellens says Blisse communicates with her eyes Laura, 27, said: 'We have to think about every noise we make in the house every day. If you sneeze or cough you can make her fit. You have got to be absolutely quiet. 'It is a startle reflex. If someone gets up suddenly or she hears your shoe on the floor it startles her. 'I’ve even had to put my house phone put it on the low setting, because the ring can make her fit.' Placed house phone on the lowest setting Told eldest daughter Neveah, 8, to play 'as quietly as she can' Make sure they don't sneeze or cough near Blisse Family also don't make sudden movements, like getting up quickly by her Only one alarm in house, which rings when Blisse has a fit. Parent's then take turns of check on her overnight The youngster suffers from two rare brain conditions called polymicrogyria and Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia - and these trigger her epilepsy. The couple only discovered something was wrong after they took their daughter to a doctor when she began twitching at four months. Blisse has a sister Neveah, eight, who knows she has to play 'as quietly as she can' to keep her safe. One of the fits could be fatal - but most see Blisse slip into a trance like state that lasts about 20 seconds. The worst fits are called tonic-clonic seizures when Blisse turns blue and stops breathing. Laura, of Barry, South Wales, treated her with emergency medicine to save her life during the worst attacks. She said: 'We have learned to be able to manage at home without ringing the ambulance. But it is devastating. The doctors have told us she is probably never going to speak or sit or walk. 'We would love to hear what her voice is like and things like that but we have come to terms that that is not going to happen. 'I communicate with her with her eyes. I can tell by the expressions on her face whether she is happy or sad.' Blisse, pictured with her mother, cannot walk or talk, but can express emotions Blisse is not expected to live past 40, but her mother says her smile gets them through each day There is one alarm which rings out in the house - it is triggered if Blisse fits in her sleep. Ashley and Laura then take turns to look after her while the other sleeps. 'We have a nurse who comes one night a week so we have a full night sleep a week,' said Laura. 'It’s lovely. You just shut your eyes and when you wake up about 10 hours are gone. I don’t think we would cope without that.' Doctors say she may live to adulthood, but is not likely to survive past 40. But Laura said: 'As long as she smiles, that is what gets us through the day. Her smile lights up her face.'"

Images of the animal lying at the side of a dirt track in the Kweneng region of the African country spread online earlier this week. This lead to complaints and accusations of a Google hit-and-run from concerned members of the public. As the Street View car approaches, the donkey is shown lying at the side of the road. Concerned members of the public complained to Google and some accused it of hit-and run The donkey is then shown getting up and moving out of the way of the Street View car. Google said the animal was 'perhaps enjoying a dust bath' In its official blog, the Californian-based company denied the accusations saying the donkey was ‘alive and well’. Kei Kawai, Group Product Manager at Google Maps added, ‘Because of the way our 360-degree imagery is put together, it looked to some that our car had been involved in an unseemly hit and run, leaving the humble beast stranded in the road.’ He then went on to say the donkey ‘was perhaps enjoying a dust bath’. A shot taken from the back of the Street View car shows the donkey looking back inquisitively at the passing vehicle Google also released a series of images to prove its innocence. The pictures show the Street View car approaching the donkey while it’s laid out on the road. And another two of the donkey stood up after the car has passed it."

It is the first time a biofuel will be used on a regular schedule on trans-Atlantic flights, although KLM has been using cooking-oil-based fuel on passenger flights in Europe since September 2011. Although the fuel maybe greener, reducing carbon emissions by up to 80 percent, it's also more expensive - costing around three times the price of regular aviation fuel at $10 per gallon. Fatty flier: It's the first time biofuels will be used on this wide-bodied Boeing 777 on a regular trans-Atlantic schedule It might be some time before the fuel is used to run more planes on long-haul routes such as this.

Kyra Sedgwick and her husband, Kevin Bacon, at the 66th annual Golden Globe Awards this month. But she may be getting more approval from her peers, too. Sedgwick will walk the red carpet again Sunday night at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, where she is nominated for a fourth consecutive year for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series for her role as Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. She's also won a Golden Globe for her performance, in 2007. The TNT series resumes Monday night where it left off in September with what Sedgwick called ""a fantastic five episodes.""

""I feel like there's some of those personal quiet moments with her alone, is something that I've been missing as an actor, and I feel like the audience has been missing, too. ""She is such a complicated, fascinating character, and watching her growth and lack of growth is something that is really interesting,"" she said. When CNN asked whether the new episodes might include a wedding for her character, Sedgwick laughed. ""That might very well happen,"" she said. ""That's pretty insightful of you. I'm just going to just say that."" A marriage for Brenda Johnson would be ""a complicated, difficult situation,"" she said, because ""she's basically married to her work."" Sedgwick's job also complicates her real-life marriage to Bacon, since the show is produced in Los Angeles and the couple lives in Connecticut with their two children. That's where the approval -- whether on the street from fans or at award shows -- has ""been a wonderful phenomenon for me,"" she said. ""On a personal level, that's really good for me, because I really miss my family when I'm working on the show six months in L.A.,"" she said. ""As much as I try to get my kids to move to L.A. and my husband, they just wouldn't have it. ""It's challenging, and I'm glad that people are watching, because otherwise it would be kind of hard to go to work,"" Sedgwick said. Sedgwick has moved into an executive producer's role on the show, which she said she expects to continue for at least two more years.

Sarah Msika admitted leaving the couple on the floor when she visited them, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. She has now been cleared of a number of other charges including allegations she failed to document her visit, did not tell another nurse about the situation and neglected to adequately clean one of the patients. An ambulance crew found Patient A, 79, on the kitchen floor covered in her own faeces propped up against a kitchen table. Medics then discovered her husband, Patient B, lying on his back with a broken leg in the lounge at their home on the outskirts of Norwich, Norfolk. He died of a blood clot to the lung two days later while his wife passed away six months later. Giving evidence, Msika insisted the couple had told her they were 'okay' when she visited them on August 4, 2011. She said: 'If a patient is quite dismissive of help or you are asking them and they are saying they are okay, I am not sure - I wasn't quite sure - of the steps to take.' David Clark, for the NMC, asked why the nurse had not informed colleagues about Patient B, who was lying on his back. Msika, who worked as an Agency Nurse for Mayday Healthcare Plc, said: 'I did, I know I did. I said I have got two patients or I left two patients on the floor that need assistance. 'I did tell them that there were two patients that needed assistance.' Mr Clark asked, 'Why did you not call the emergency services?' Msika said: 'I have been asked that question so many times. I have asked myself the question so many times. 'I did not at the time think I needed to call an ambulance. The concern that I had was they were on the floor. 'Patient B didn't look distressed or anything and was actually refusing any help. 'I knew nothing about Patient B. He was not my patient, I did not have any background information about him. I had no idea why he was on the floor. 'I think it is quite evident that they were a couple who were quite reluctant to receive any help.' Msika described the situation as 'challenging' but said she had never intended 'to cause harm to anyone'. The nurse referred to the NMC code of conduct, which 'states that I should respect and support people's rights to accept or decline care'. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (pictured) cleared Msika of allegations she failed to document her visit, did not tell another nurse about the situation and neglected to adequately clean one of the patients A 'relatively brief' police investigation was mounted into the incident, but Msika faced no criminal charges, the hearing was told. Msika admitted leaving Patients A and B on the floor of their home, failing to call for emergency assistance and failing to carry out a proper assessment of Patient B. She also admitted failing to notice that Patient B had fractured his leg and failing to escalate the situation. 'I think it is quite evident that they were a couple who were quite reluctant to receive any help' - Sarah Msika Allegations that she failed to document her visit, did not tell another nurse about the situation and neglected to adequately clean Patient A were found not proved. In relation to the allegation that Msika left Patient A sitting in faeces, panel chairman Dr Andy Thomson said: 'The panel concluded that Mrs Msika would not have been expected to clean Patient A on her own. 'The panel finds that Mrs Msika did not adequately clean Patient A. 'However, as Mrs Msika would not have been expected to clean Patient A on her own, she should have sought assistance in a timelier manner in order to have Patient A cleaned. 'The panel considered that she failed to adequately escalate this matter or seek assistance to clean Patient A 'Therefore, the panel found this charge not proved.' The allegation that Msika had not told other nurses about the situation was dismissed as it was based on 'mutiple hearsay evidence'. A charge that she failed to make appropriate records was dismissed due to 'insufficient evidence'. Msika now faces an anxious wait over her fate as the panel ran out of time before deciding whether she was guilty of misconduct. The hearing was adjourned until December 9."

When her husband failed to check in with her on Friday, Mrs Blake feared that he may have died. But she said knowing Buddy would be protecting him helped ease her mind during the rescue. Companion: Robert often took his four-year-old retriever with him on skiing trips 'I knew Buddy was with him, and would not leave him, I knew that, you know just from my heart,' she said. After keeping a vigil over Mr Blake, the four-year-old dog is now providing companionship for the skier's grieving widow, who said she couldn't 'make it without him'.

This makes temperatures rise, prompting plants and trees to flower—and release pollen—earlier each spring; in the fall, they delay the death of ragweed plants from frost, extending the pollen season, Levetin explains. End result: ""Fall"" allergies may go practically into winter. Health.com: The worst plants for your allergies There's more pollen than ever Higher amounts of carbon dioxide not only kick-start pollen production, they also boost the amount of pollen each plant generates, too -- especially in urban areas, where the gas is more plentiful. To add insult to injury, CO2 is making pollen more potent, too. ""There's more allergen now in each grain than there used to be,"" Demain says. And pollen isn't the only allergen on the rise. Increasingly balmy temperatures mean more moisture in the air, which creates mold. ""The higher temperatures and gas may increase not just the growth of mold but also its spore production—which is how it distributes allergens—both indoors and out,"" Demain says. Health.com: Protect your home and family from dangerous mold and mildew More people are developing allergies The number of Americans with allergies is two to five times higher now than it was about 30 years ago, according to surveys from the National Institutes of Health. Genes play a role in your susceptibility, but the blooming allergy boom is most likely due to the longer, more intense pollen seasons — plus these expert-supported theories: We're too clean. Now that we're exposed to less dirt and bacteria (thanks in part to our obsession with antibacterial everything), and have fewer scourges like polio and parasites to fight, our immune systems are quicker to overreact to otherwise harmless substances like pollen, says Levetin. At the same time, our environment is too dirty: Studies show that pollution (such as exhaust fumes) can trigger allergic flare-ups. Our modern diet is hurting us. Today's processed, preserved foods lack the tough fibers of the plants and grains our ancestors feasted on, throwing off the delicate balance of bacteria in our guts and setting us up for allergic sensitivity, says University of Michigan professor of internal medicine Gary Huffnagle, Ph.D.. Studies suggest, too, that as use of antibiotics — which also disrupt bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract — has surged, so have allergies. Health.com: Your secret allergy triggers revealed The good news: Even if we're now more prone to sniffling, sneezing, and itchy eyes, ""there are many more treatment options on the market now,"" says Levetin. ""The current medications are so much better than they used to be."" A potent mix of non-sedating antihistamines, steroid sprays, and eyedrops help target today's stepped-up symptoms. And in the end, simply getting back to nature—by skipping the hand sanitizer from time to time and eating whole, fresh foods—may just be a crucial defense against, well, nature.

Ospina moved to the Emirates in July after shining for Colombia as they reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil. Szczesny says that after Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea when his contract expired it was inevitable that Arsene Wenger would strengthen in that position during the current transfer window.

'I was expecting someone to come because Lukasz has left for Swansea and I wish him all the best. I knew someone would come in. I'm just going to do the same thing over again, I'm going to try my best in every game and every week in training. Hopefully that will be enough.' Szczesny, who played in Sunday's Emirates Cup defeat to Monaco, thinks the first-team squad are reaching the right level of fitness ahead of the new Premier League campaign. 'It would have been nice to win a cup that we play at home, but that's not what we talk about in pre-season,' he said. 'We want to prepare and make sure we are at our very best at the weekend [in the Community Shield] and then against Crystal Palace in [the Premier League]. 'Last year we had a long pre-season and we played a lot of games in Asia. This year is completely different but I think everyone is looking sharper every single day.'

The yob - believed to be from Derby - drank the fish from a pint glass containing a disgusting concoction of cider, raw eggs, engine oil and his own urine. The RSPCA has spoken out against the 'horrible craze' after receiving numerous reports of people drinking live fish and posting the footage online. Sick: A man has filmed himself drinking a pint of filthy liquids with three live goldfish in it Preparations: The man poured a pint of cider mixed with raw eggs and engine oil NekNominate is a new trend which sees web users filming themselves drinking large amounts of alcohol and performing other outlandish stunts. It came under fire this week after two young men died in Ireland while participating in the craze. In the video of the man downing the goldfish, he can be seen smiling at the camera dressed in just a satin thong and a bow tie. Viewers praised the stunt, egging on the man in his quest to be deliberately outrageous. One wrote: 'Smashed it, knew you would come good, the fishes are your secret weapon.' Foul: The man urinated into the glass before putting three live goldfish in too Another said, 'That should go viral, hats off mate, that's class,' while a third added: 'That's by far the sickest I've seen. Gagged watching it.' The RSPCA is investigating more than a dozen reports of animal cruelty from people who have watched video footage of goldfish being drunk by NekNominate participants. 'We are extremely concerned about this shocking new trend,' said wildlife scientist Nicola White. 'We have had quite a few similar cases reported to us in a very short space of time - but this could be just the tip of the iceberg as there's probably many more we have not been told about. 'Eating a live animal and posting of a film of it on the internet is not some light-hearted joke - it is unacceptable. It sends out a clear message that animal cruelty is OK as long as it is in the guise of entertainment. 'We urge people not to take part in this horrible craze and to report to us anyone who is taking part.' Praise: Other web users spoke in support of the man's antics, with one saying 'hats off' The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global. The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world. The concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink Responsible'. The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet. One popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain bowl to lap it up. Superintendent Gary Parkin of Derbyshire Police said: 'Drinking large amounts of alcohol in a short space of time can have very serious consequences. 'Social media is used for many different things, both good and bad, and clearly this is at the wrong end of the scale. Challenging each other to drink more and more, often different and stronger alcoholic drinks, will cause harm and damage. 'It is obvious from recent stories and incidents that people have lost control trying to better people they know either as friends or through social media and have ended up in A&E or, more tragically, have died. 'I would urge people to act with responsibility when drinking alcohol and avoid putting themselves in unnecessary danger.' Other NekNominate-related incidents to hit the headlines include a woman apparently riding into Tesco on a horse before downing a fizzy drink. However, some people have attempted to turn the trend on its head by using it to spread positive behaviour such as donating blood, rather than binge drinking."

The 57-year-old man was fishing with his wife on the bank of the Adelaide River Monday when his line apparently became snagged, Northern Territory Police said. ""It appears he has entered the water and tragically was taken by a crocodile while retrieving fishing equipment,"" they said in a statement on Facebook. Parks and Wildlife Rangers and members of the Water Police Section subsequently shot and killed the 4.5 meter (14.7 foot) crocodile, they said. The man's body was found nearby. The incident is believed to have occurred about 5.30 p.m. local time Monday (4 a.m ET, 8 a.m. GMT), police said. Peter Saltmarsh, from Spectacular Jumping Crocodile Cruise, told CNN it was the first time in his 20 years working as a guide on the river that such an incident had occurred. ""There are plenty of crocodiles up here and we don't have many problems as a rule. There are lots of signs, there are lots of cruises, there are lots of warnings and there's lots of knowledge,"" he said. Five companies operate crocodile cruises in the area with the giant reptiles distributed about one every 100 meters along the river, on the banks of which they could sometimes be spotted, Saltmarsh said. ""They normally eat fish and kangaroos and other things -- they're not after us. They're very timid and elusive animals, they're very lazy and very rarely seen."" He said crocodiles could stay underwater for up to four hours. ""Michael Jackson"" was recognizable for its pale head and had been known to locals for about 10 years, Saltmarsh said. The late pop singer Michael Jackson had suffered from the skin condition vitiligo, which caused parts of his skin to lighten. Saltmarsh said it was unfortunate that the victim had apparently entered water inhabited by big crocodiles at dusk to retrieve his lure. ""The crocodile could have thought he was any sort of an animal. It's just really, really unfortunate. This person's made a tragic error of judgment."" Recognizable crocodile Dr. Adam Britton has been researching crocodiles in the Northern Territory for about 18 years and was familiar with ""Michael Jackson."" ""What made that particular animal special was that it had a very light colored head, so it was very recognizable,"" he said. ""It was missing part of its tail, two limbs and had a big scar on its belly. ""He was an old, beaten up, battle-scarred crocodile that everyone knew,"" Britton said. ""When this report of someone being killed came in, people knew he was pretty much the only crocodile that lived in that territory,"" he said. ""A lot of people didn't want to see him shot."" But Britton said that it was a legal requirement that the crocodile be killed so that the coroner could confirm the cause of death by, for example, matching bite marks and examining the reptile's stomach contents. Evidence also suggested that if a crocodile successfully took a human it would be more likely to do so again in the future, he said. ""Crocodiles learn patterns and routines and we know from their wild behavior that they'll actually come back to the same spot to catch a prey animal."" Britton said that he had heard of other people previously fishing from the same area where the man was taken. It had better access than most of the Adelaide River, which is mainly edged by muddy mangroves, he said. The fact that others may have fished there without incident could have created a mistaken sense of safety, Britton said. ""One of the things that makes crocodiles so dangerous is that you can do things like that and get away with it. Because crocodiles don't always attack,"" he said. ""That leads people into a false sense of security about how risky it actually it is."" In the wrong place at the wrong time, tragedies like this could then happen, he said. ""Often crocodiles will hone in on people who are actually fishing,"" Britton said. ""There have been examples of crocodiles sneaking up and stealing fish. Likely when [the victim] stepped in to get his lure back, it was right there under the water -- probably expecting a fish. As far as the crocodile was concerned that was potential food for it."" Worldwide attacks ""It's just a tragedy on every level, there are no positives that can possibly come out of this,"" Britton said, adding that someone shouldn't have to lose their life to drive the safety message home. While ""Michael Jackson"" was not actually an Albino -- a genetic mutation -- it was rare to see crocodiles with its coloring, which likely resulted from temperature changes during its incubation, he said. ""It doesn't happen very often. But if you hatch out thousands of eggs you'll see a few examples every few years,"" he said. Britton said Michael Jackson was probably 40 to 50 years-old, meaning he would have hatched at a time when the number of crocodiles in Australia was low. Declining numbers led to their protection in Australia in 1971, but the population is now regarded as being almost fully recovered, he said. The species was found throughout South East Asia, Britton said and a database -- Crocbite -- had been created to record confirmed attacks across the world going back to the 1800s. Prior to Monday's fatal attack, the most recent suspected attack in the Northern Territory was on Melville Island, where Australian Broadcaster ABC reported that ""biological remains"" had been found inside a crocodile after a man had gone missing earlier this month."

The American achieved fame and fortune through his tennis exploits and befriended Hollywood stars such as Charlie Chaplin, but he spent over a year in jail in the 1940s on a morals charge, which ruined his reputation before his untimely death in 1953. Tilden won his six straight U.S. Open titles from 1920-1925, a record since the tournament abolished the challenge system -- where the champion automatically qualified for the final -- in 1911. Under that system, Richard Sears won the first seven editions of the U.S. Open (then the U.S. National Tennis Championships) in the 1880s. Last year, world No. 1 Roger Federer failed in his bid to match Tilden's record when he was beaten in the final by Juan Martin Del Potro. Tilden, who claimed his seventh U.S. Open title in 1929 as well as being twice a losing finalist, goes down in the history books as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. A relatively late starter, Tilden struggled to get into his college tennis team in Pennsylvania, but years of dedicated practice started to bear fruit after the First World War as he reached the U.S. Open finals of 1918 and 1919. He reached his peak in the 1920s, winning his first U.S. Open title and holding the world number one spot for seven straight years. Tilden also led the United States to a record seven straight Davis Cup titles as well as claiming three Wimbledon titles. His famed ""cannonball"" serves worked particularly well on the fast grass surfaces on which the U.S. Open and Wimbledon were staged. Tilden never won the French Open, being losing finalist in the last year it was held on grass courts, in 1927, and 1930 on clay. He won the last of his 10 grand slam titles at Wimbledon in 1930 before deserting the amateur ranks for the fledging professional circuit Eventually joined by the likes of Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry and Don Budge, Tilden remained a star attraction until well into his 40s, filling arenas such as Madison Square Garden in big-money matches. But off the court, Tilden was a controversial figure, battling with tennis officials as his amateur status was called into question, and he was accused of being arrogant and inconsiderate. Tilden, who never married, saw his reputation destroyed in the 1940s when he was found guilty of a morals charge in connection with a minor. He served seven-and-a-half months of a year's jail term, but was arrested again in 1949 after picking up a 16-year-old male hitchhiker. Tilden served a further 10 months for his probation violation and was shunned by the tennis community. His friendship with Hollywood stars such as Chaplin and a love of the theatrical world saw Tilden pour much of his riches into less-than-successful Broadway productions. He died a tragic figure in 1953, having a stroke in Los Angeles as he prepared for a trip to play in the U.S. Pro Championships despite his 60 years of age. Tilden was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1959, and in any polls of all-time great tennis players he always features in the top order."

Maj. Rick Jenkins added that, at this point in this investigation, ""we cannot say definitively"" that the second victim had fired the shots that killed Officer Deriek W. Crouse. But the man does appear on video footage from moments before that officer was killed, and he also matches the description first put out by police of the suspect. In addition, Jenkins said authorities ""have recovered clothing items that lead us to believe that"" the second victim and the man on the video ""are one and the same."" The incident began about 12:15 p.m., when Crouse, a four-year Virginia Tech police veteran, pulled over someone during a routine traffic stop in the Cassell Coliseum parking lot near McComas Hall. The Cassell Coliseum at Virginia Tech houses athletic facilities. McComas Hall houses exercise facilities. Soon thereafter, police ""dispatch was unable to make contact with the officer,"" Virginia Tech Deputy Police Chief Gene Deisinger said. Then, before 12:30 p.m., police received their first call from a witness who said he'd seen the suspect -- who state police Sgt. Bob Carpentieri said authorities ""do not believe ... was in the vehicle that was stopped"" -- approach the officer's car and open fire. A few minutes later, at 12:36 p.m., the first of six alerts was issued to the campus community about the shooting. A visibly upset Julie Fleming described to CNN affiliate WDBJ how she'd been walking nearby and saw police pull up around the vehicle of the officer who had been shot. ""When they opened (the car door), he just fell out toward the ground, and they immediately started reviving him,"" she said, adding that two officers then took off with weapons after the gunman. Brian Walls, an employee in the school's athletic department, told CNN he also saw first-responders trying to resuscitate someone in the same area, which is also near the university's football stadium. The shooter had fled on foot toward a parking lot known as ""the Cage,"" school spokesman Mark Owczarski said. This suspect was ""described as white male, gray sweat pants, gray hat w/ neon green brim, maroon hoodie and backpack,"" Virginia Tech said in posts on its website and Twitter feed. About a quarter-mile from the first shooting, in what's described as the ""I-Lot,"" a law enforcement officer saw a suspicious man and tried to contact him, Virginia Tech Police Department Deputy Chief Gene Deisinger said. ""By the time they turned around and located the subject, that subject was deceased,"" the deputy chief said. Gov. Bob McDonnell said Thursday night that ""another gunshot"" had been heard between 15 to 30 minutes after the first shooting. The clothes tied to the initial suspect description were recovered later. Jenkins, though, did not state they were found on the second dead man, where he was found. While several updates were sent out, it wasn't until 4:30 p.m. that the school announced on its Twitter feed that ""law enforcement agencies have determined there is no longer an active threat or need to secure in place. Resume normal activities."" On Thursday afternoon, authorities similarly did not explicitly state that the second person shot dead had earlier killed the police officer. Carpentieri said only that ""investigators feel confident that they have located"" the officer's shooter. ""When the university lifted the alert, they consulted with several people and they felt that it was safe for students and faculty to go about their day,"" Carpentieri said. ""We like to think that things are safe."" Crouse, 39, joined the Virginia Tech police force six months after the 2007 mass shooting, according to a release on the school's website. A U.S. Army veteran who had worked at the New River Valley jail and with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department, the Christiansburg resident is survived by his wife as well as five children and stepchildren. The second slain man has not been identified by name. And police also have not given a possible motive for the shootings. The Virginia State Police are taking the lead in the investigation, Deisinger said. Federal agents are involved as well, including six agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who responded to the scene, ATF spokesman Scot Thomasson said. In addition to reviewing the video from Crouse's car, investigators are sorting through ballistic and DNA evidence and interviewing witnesses, said Jenkins of the state police The episode rattled a campus where 33 people were killed on April 16, 2007, when student Seung-Hui Cho went on a shooting rampage. Two of those deaths occurred at West Ambler Johnston Hall, across the street from the Coliseum lot. ""In light of the turmoil and the trauma and the tragedy suffered by this campus by guns, I can only say that words don't describe our feelings and they are most elusive at this point in time,"" Virginia Tech President Charles Steger told reporters Thursday. On Thursday, law enforcement and school officials said the alert system put in place in recent years worked well, both from technological and communications standpoints. ""What I observed and experienced was significant cooperation from everybody I encountered,"" Deisinger said of what he saw, on campus, after the alerts went out. ""I think the community received the notification and responded to that, as we asked them to."" Kiersten Todt Coon, a risk management consultant who has worked with other universities on campus management, said it appears that accurate information was communicated quickly and methodically -- in contrast to what happened four years ago. That said, she said school administrators should now review whether that information got out to everyone who needed to get it. ""Did the messages work across the board?"" Coon asked rhetorically. One school administrator said he and other staffers locked rooms and laboratories in Shanks Hall within three minutes of getting the first alert around 12:36 p.m. In the subsequent hours, he said faculty and employees got ""regular and updated information"" that he described as ""very helpful"" and calming. ""We've practiced this over time,"" said Robert E. Denton Jr., head of Virginia Tech's department of communication, told CNN affiliate WSLS during the lockdown. ""This is kind of scary to go through ... It brings back so much."" McDonnell lauded the communications effort not just as governor, but also as a parent: His daughter is a Virginia Tech master's student who was confined to a basement classroom during the four-hour episode. ""Like so many parents who had children on the Virginia Tech campus, I felt a lot of that angst and uncertainty,"" he said. ""Again, I want to express my gratitude to law enforcement for making sure that they kept the faculty (and) parents regularly informed."" Classes for the semester ended Wednesday. Students were preparing Thursday for final exams for the fall semester, though the university announced on its website that Friday's exams had been postponed to Saturday. A small vigil was held Thursday night on the Blacksburg campus, and a similar event is scheduled for for 6:30 p.m. Friday, according to a posting on the student government association's Twitter account. Beyond Virginia Tech, Thursday's incident had ripple effects elsewhere in western Virginia. All public schools in Montgomery County -- where Blacksburg is located -- were also placed on lockdown, county school Superintendent Brenda Blackburn said. Dismissal eventually began at 3:30 p.m., after a delay of more than an hour. In addition, a western Virginia rest area along Interstate 81 was shut down Thursday afternoon, Virginia Department of Transportation spokesman Jason Bond said. The stop, on the highway's northbound side, is about nine miles from the Virginia Tech exit. He did not know whether that move -- which was ordered by state police -- was related to the Blacksburg shooting. Carpentieri noted there was ""some suspicious activity at that location,"" though he also declined to say whether it was related to the Virginia Tech incident. Several Virginia Tech administrators -- including the head of campus police, Wendell Flinchum, and the emergency management director, Michael Mulhare -- were in Washington on Thursday at a federal court hearing on the 2007 shooting on the school's campus, according to U.S. Department of Education officials. Flinchum and the school were criticized after that incident for not notifying students quickly enough that there was a danger on campus. The hearing was an appeal of the Department of Education's fine of $55,000 on Virginia Tech under the Clery Act, a federal law related to campus safety. In April, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli called the 2007 case against Virginia Tech ""Monday-morning quarterbacking at its very worst."" As to Thursday's incident, Carpentieri stressed that there were ""two crime scenes"" -- where the two bodies were found -- and that the probe is ongoing, with many questions still unanswered. At the same time, he voiced confidence that ""things are safe for people to be out again."" ""These are large crime scenes and it takes several hours to put the puzzle together,"" the state police sergeant said. ""We still don't have a lot of the puzzle pieces connected.""

By colonising the peninsula it was hoped that Anzacs would open up to the waters up to the allied naval forces. From there, troops aimed to conquer Constantinople, now Istanbul. But from the time the first boats landed before dawn on April 25, it was clear the campaign would be a catastrophic failure.

The Metropolitan Police are still investigating the incident Monday night in which at least one man scaled a security fence to gain entry to the palace. One man was arrested for burglary, trespass and criminal damage, police said. The man was found inside the palace in an area open to the public during the day, police said. The second man was arrested for alleged conspiracy to commit burglary. No members of the royal family were at the London residence during the incident, police said. The incident has prompted a review of security at Buckingham Palace, the best known of Queen Elizabeth II's palaces. It's not the first time an intruder has managed to get into the central London palace. In 1982, Michael Fagan was arrested in the queen's bedroom after gaining access to the building via a drainpipe. According to news reports from the time, the queen woke to find him by her bed and talked with him until she was able to raise the alarm. That incident led to promises of tighter security at the palace. Other incidents have occurred since, but none has involved anyone getting as close to the queen as Fagan did. However, in 2004, a fathers' rights campaigner dressed as Batman evaded security to stage a protest on a Buckingham Palace balcony. Jason Hatch, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner, used a ladder to scale the perimeter fence before climbing onto the balcony, where the royals appear on ceremonial occasions such as the wedding of Prince William and Catherine in 2011. Concerns escalated after a Daily Mirror reporter got a job at Buckingham Palace as a servant before U.S. President George W. Bush stayed there during a state visit in November 2003. Stand-up comedian Aaron Barschak had highlighted lax security by gate-crashing Prince William's 21st birthday party at Windsor less than six months earlier. Buckingham Palace's 19 State Rooms, filled with magnificent paintings, sculpture and antique furniture, are open to paying visitors in summer, when the royal family is elsewhere. The palace is the administrative center for the royal household, as well as the queen's London residence. Laura Smith-Spark reported from London and Nicky Robertson reported from Atlanta."

The former Everton, Manchester City and Oldham boss joins a new look set-up at Carrow Road following relegation from the Premier League. Last month, Neil Adams was confirmed as the club's full-time manager and the club have also appointed Falkirk boss Gary Holt and former Under-21 boss Mark Robson as first team coaches. Experienced head: Joe Royle appointed football consultant at Norwich Adams said: 'Mark and Gary are two people I've worked with closely and both will bring enthusiasm, hunger and experience to the coaching team. They have also played at the highest levels in this country. 'Joe is someone who I have played for at both Championship and Premier League level, and he has amassed a vast amount of knowledge during his time in the game. He has been there, seen it and done it so to speak, and has also been very successful during his time as both a player and a manager.' Royle will support and advise Adams' football management team having initially worked with the new boss when he was manager of Oldham Athletic during Adams' playing days. Norwich plan to announce a new technical director shortly and are currently interviewing a number of candidates for the position of director of recruitment. Moving on: Gary Holt is returning to his old club Norwich with his family Early on Monday afternoon Falkirk released a statement on their website explaining to supporters that Holt was moving to Carrow Road. But just two hours later they were forced to remove that statement as they admitted no deal had been agreed and that Holt was still in charge at the Falkirk Stadium. When Norwich then announced on their website at around 5pm that an agreement had been reached, the original Falkirk statement was then reposted and the apology taken down. Former Scotland international Holt - an ex-Canaries player - will now link up again with boss Adams, who he worked alongside in the Norwich academy set-up before moving back to Scotland last year when he was handed the Falkirk job. After clearing up their earlier mistake, Falkirk wished Holt luck on his new venture. New team: Gary Holt will work with Norwich boss Neil Adams Their statement read: 'The club can confirm that Head Coach Gary Holt has accepted a coaching role at Norwich City after Falkirk granted the Carrow Road side permission to speak to him over the weekend.' Bairns chairman Martin Ritchie added: 'The Club fully understands Gary's wishes to return with his family to Norwich. We would like to wish him every success in the future and to thank him for all his work at Falkirk over the last year.' Holt led Falkirk to third in the Scottish Championship this season but lost out on promotion when they were beaten by Hamilton in the play-off semi-finals. But his employers had even started the search for his replacement, adding in a further statement: 'Following today's announcement that Gary Holt is leaving the club to take up the post of assistant manager at Norwich City, the search starts immediately for a new head coach. 'The club aims to have a new head coach in position by the time the team come back for pre-season training on Thursday, June 26. To meet this very tight timescale, the club will draw up a shortlist of potential candidates by the end of this week.'"

""Styrofoam increases the cost of recycling by as much as $20 per ton because it has to be removed,"" the mayor said. ""Something we know is environmentally destructive, that is costing taxpayers money, and that is easily replaceable, I think, is something we can do without."" Specifically, the ban will target certain polystyrene foam products, not necessarily Styrofoam, a trademarked product of Dow Chemical Co. used in foam insulation and construction products. ""With Speaker (Christine) Quinn and the City Council, we'll work to adopt a law banning Styrofoam food packaging from our stores and restaurants,"" Bloomberg added. ""And don't worry, the doggy bag and the coffee cup will survive just fine."" It was not immediately clear how the majority of businesses that use polystyrene foam products would react to a ban. One early response from the Dunkin' Donuts chain was not positive. Instead of an outright ban, it said in a written statement, the company has ""reviewed or tested nearly every type of single-use hot cup on the market, but a viable alternative does not yet exist. This is a process, and we will continue to test and try new things until we find a cup that keeps drinks hot, hands cool and is better for the planet. ""A polystyrene ban will not eliminate waste or increase recycling; it will simply replace one type of trash with another,"" it said. Until a solution is found, Dunkin' Donuts has cut the weight of its foam and plastic cups and ""offered our franchisees a reusable mug program."" Plastic foam product limitations have already been ordered in several other cities, including Seattle, Washington, and Brookline, Massachusetts. Throughout his tenure, Bloomberg has garnered a reputation for bold and sometimes controversial initiatives. Despite public outcry, he pushed to regulate trans fat in food preparation in 2007, signed into law a ban on smoking in most public spaces in 2011, and last March prohibited sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in certain venues. The mayor has also advocated for, and sometimes financially supported, same-sex marriage, gun control, and several new public health proposals. ""Now we are working on obesity and hopefully the courts won't stop us,"" Bloomberg said of his health policy efforts during a January press conference. ""These small public health things that we do really make a difference in people's lives."""

The plan is aimed at ""folks who are playing by the rules,"" Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan says. President Barack Obama announced the plan Wednesday, saying it will help up to 9 million people keep their homes in a housing market ravaged by foreclosures. But critics, including several leading Republicans and some commentators, said the $75 billion proposal will unfairly help some people at the expense of others. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs acknowledged Friday that some people who made ""bad decisions"" might end up getting help under the proposal. But Donovan, Obama's secretary of housing and urban development, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that ""there are no 'flippers,' investor-owners or scammers that are eligible for this program."" ""We're going check everybody's income when they come into this program. We're going to make sure that people are paying their bills. And more than anything, we're targeting the folks who are playing by the rules,"" Donovan said. The administration's proposal would make it easier for homeowners to afford their monthly payments either by refinancing the mortgages or having their loans modified. And it would vastly broaden the scope of the government rescue by focusing on homeowners who are still current in their payments but at risk of default. Read more about the plan South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican who also has criticized the administration's stimulus package, called the mortgage plan ""a horrible idea."" ""About 95 percent of folks are playing by the rules and struggling, but still paying their mortgages. The idea that somebody down the street gets a different system, I think, is ultimately something that's going to undermine a whole lot of other folks with regard to paying their mortgage,"" Sanford told ""Fox News Sunday."" In particular, he singled out a provision that would allow judges to modify or reduce the principal of loans for borrowers in bankruptcy -- an idea Sanford called ""incredibly dangerous for the precedent it sets."" But Donovan told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that judges already have that power for second homes or vacation homes. ""It's only for people who have one home and are living in it or are in trouble where you can't have a modification of that loan in bankruptcy,"" he said. But he said the administration would limit the plan to existing loans, not future ones, and considered it a ""last resort."" ""There seems to be growing consensus that this is an important part of the solution,"" he said. About $50 billion of the money would come from the $700 billion financial industry bailout package, a senior administration official said Friday. Nationalized mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will contribute more than $20 billion to the loan modification program, mainly to subsidize interest rates so troubled borrowers' monthly payments can be lowered to affordable levels. But those companies are on shaky financial ground themselves and are expected to report billions in losses in the next week or two. To stabilize them, the foreclosure prevention program calls for doubling their lines of credit with the federal government to $200 billion each. Donovan said 45 percent of home sales in December were ""distressed,"" meaning either sellers were facing foreclosure or the homes were already seized by the bank, driving down home prices further in an already-battered market. ""We've got to make clear, here, that a foreclosure hurts every American,"" he told CNN. In releasing his proposal Wednesday, Obama said it would help both responsible homeowners suffering from falling home prices and borrowers either at risk of or already in default. But it does virtually nothing for the unemployed, who often don't have enough income to make any reasonable monthly payment affordable. And since it relies more heavily on lowering interest rates than on reducing principal, it does little for borrowers concerned their homes will never recoup their value."

Baltimore Police Officer Jeffrey Bolger has been charged with animal cruelty, with officials saying there was no reason to kill the dog if it was already restrained. The alleged attack happened on Saturday morning in Brewers Hill, a south-eastern district of the city, after police responded to a report of a woman being bitten. Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said officers gained control of the animal, a seven-year-old Chinese Shar-Pei, with a dog pole and an officer used a knife to cut the dog's throat. Late last night, Detective Jeremy Silbert issued a statement identifying that policeman as Bolger. Announcing that internal affairs were investigating the killing, Mr Palmere called the incident 'outrageous and unacceptable'. Witnesses told police that as Bolger got out of his vehicle, he said: 'I'm going to f****** gut this thing.' He waited until colleagues got control of the dog before bending down and slashing its throat with a knife, witnesses said. It bled to death before animal control arrived, police told the Baltimore Sun. The dog was initially thought to be a stray, but later was determined to have escaped from its home. Its owner says her pet, called Nala, was not vicious but just lost and scared. 'I never thought in a million years the police would show up and cut my dog’s throat,' Sarah Gossard told CBS Baltimore. Miss Gossard had posted pictures of Nala online after the dog had gone missing. It is understood that the woman who was bitten had been trying to read the dogs tags, which were engraved with an address and phone number. 'She went missing Saturday and after looking for her all day, I found out through a neighbour that she was put down,' Miss Gossard told CNN. 'Police never contacted me until today. Only after did I find out more details. I learned from the news that she was stabbed in the throat. I want justice.' Shar-Pei's are a fighting breed originally used as palace guards in China. The protective and loyal dogs take well to training and are easily socialised but can be stubborn. Largely silent, they only bark when playing or worried. Bolger, who has been on the force since 1992, has been suspended without pay. Police are investigating why Bolger's colleagues didn't report the incident until Monday - two days later. Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez told a news conference: 'We have no words to describe this. To say that we’re appalled at the allegations I think is an understatement.' Mr Palemere told reporters: 'This is an outrageous and unacceptable breach of our protocol. The BPD does not condone and will not condone such actions.'"

Congo captain Mulumbu seemed to damage his hamstring in the 15th minute, and despite attempting to continue, he was stretchered off six minutes later. Bolasie, so superb in a man of the match display on Sunday against Zambia, was practically anonymous.

Having been unlucky to only pick up a point in their first game, the Congolese side were surprisingly off the pace against the competition’s smallest country, failing to get their dangerous attacking players into the game. Bolasie briefly burst to life in stoppage time at the end of the first half, running at the Cape Verde defence before driving a shot from the edge of the box which was saved, relatively comfortably, by Josimar Dias. It was his only meaningful contribution in a thoroughly disappointing performance, which was cut short soon after when the winger replaced after an hour. The result leaves both sides knowing a win in their final game will guarantee progress to the knockout stages, but anything less could see them crash out. Cape Verde defender Stopira (right) tries to win the ball from Mpeko (left) The Leopards were indebted to their keeper  Robert Kidiaba to even get away with a point. The 38-year-old made a superb double save five minutes from time following a corner, and another stunning stop two minutes later to deny substitute Heldon Ramos. The closest Congo came to a goal was when the Blue Sharks’ centre back Gege almost beat his own keeper with a back-header, but Josimar reacted just in time to stop the ball going over the line. Cape Verde, on the other hand, appeared to have taken confidence from holding Tunisia in their opener, and showed the greater invention. Estoril forward Kuca was a particular threat, using his pace to get in behind the Leopards defence several times.

There¿s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot. Google's camera-armed Street View cars have caused controversy wherever they've driven - but now the search giant is to 'go offroad'. Google's new Street Trekker backpack cameras will allow the search giant to explore back yards, footpaths and even the wilderness. Describing the previous Google Maps as 'not much of a map', the Californian company unveiled a new technology that fits the previously car-mounted cameras inside a bacpack. The company has already tested the cameras 'in the wild' - but it's unclear as to how much of the world Google plans to explore. 'Today, we’re taking another step forward with our Street View Trekker,' said the company this week. 'You’ve seen our cars, trikes, snowmobiles and trolleys—but wheels only get you so far. There’s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot. 'Trekker solves that problem by enabling us to photograph beautiful places such as the Grand Canyon so anyone can explore them. All the equipment fits in this one backpack, and we’ve already taken it out on the slopes.' Google Street View is banned in countries such as Germany over privacy concerns. Google also announced a complete overhaul to the imagery on Google Maps. The search giant has sent a convoy of planes over major cities in the world, each plane capturing advanced 3D information and detailed photographs. The result will be a complete 3D experience of major cities across the world, allowing users to swoop and fly through replicas which are exact - with even trees getting the 3D treatment. 'It’s a pretty limited search engine that only draws from a subset of sources,' said Google via its official mapping blog, referring to the current state of Street View. 'In the same way, it’s not much of a map that leaves you stranded the moment you step off the highway or visit a new country. Over the last few years we’ve been building a comprehensive base map of the entire globe—based on public and commercial data, imagery from every level (satellite, aerial and street level) and the collective knowledge of our millions of users.'

Two of TOWIE's hottest stars have taken to the kitchen in an attempt to impress mystery dates by cooking them dinner. Reality TV's Tom Pearce and James ‘Diags’ Bennewith grapple with knives and flip pans with ease in the footage, getting hot and bothered as they cook up a storm. Messy attempt: Diags starts to layer his tortillas with the mince and vegetable mixture Armed with a recipe for lamb keema tortilla stacks, the lads, who left The Only Way Is Essex last year, competed against each other to make the best version of the dish. In the video filmed for a campaign for LambSoc, the online community for English Beef and Lamb, 23-year-old Tom is clearly the more experienced chef of the two as his pal Diags seems to struggle with the simple task of dicing an onion. But both lads can't stop the tears streaming from their eyes as they take their knives to the allium. 'Hahaha, you're crying,' Diags, 23, cheekily points out as Tom's eyes start streaming. Diags and Tom filming TOWIE before their departure from the ITVBe programme last year Cook-off: Tom Pearce (left) and James ‘Diags’ Bennewith (right) start by dicing onions for lamb tortilla stacks Blinded by tears, the pair continue to gamely dice onion, chop chilli and peel garlic. A one point it looks as though Diags is in danger of losing a finger after a particularly risky knife move by Tom. 'What are you doing?' he exclaims as Tom narrowly misses his digits. 'My fingers are there mate.' The dynamic kitchen duo then gently fry the raw ingredients in the pan, with Tom tossing the cooked ingredients as Diags adds generous spoonfuls of cumin and garam masala to the mixture. 'Mate, that's too much', Tom reprimands but Diags insists that he's following the recipe to the letter. Adding lamb mince to the pan, the boys take it in turns to stir, mixing in fresh herbs and tomatoes to the mixture. 'Look how juicy it's got all of a sudden,' Tom says as he stirs the mixture in the pan. It's good,' he says, as he tastes the mixture while Diags complains that it could be too spicy. Chefs in the making: Tom tosses the raw ingredients in the frying pan as Diags watches Diags and Tom dish up their respective tortilla stacks to their mystery dates The competition kicks up a notch when it's time to assemble the tortilla stacks. Tom's precise stacking skills come to the fore as he carefully spreads his keema on the tortilla before sprinkling on the cheese. 'Tortilla down,' he says, placing it on the baking tray. He then spreads the mince before laying another pancake on the top. 'The trick to this is not to put too much filling,' Diags advises as Tom carefully lays another pancake on his pile before starting the the process again. But he then proceeds to ignore his own advice and starts piling the mince onto his tortilla . Bits of meat spill out of the sides and he has to use his fingers to pat them back into their floury casing. 'You have to massage the meat like you massage a lady,' Tom says, as he shows off his perfect tortilla stack. When it comes to garnishes and decoration, Tom opts for peas while Diags places a whole de-seeded chilli on his stack. They then put their creation in the oven, just in the nick of time as the mystery girls arrive for dinner. Presenting their respective offerings to their dates, Tom's presentation gets the thumbs up from both women, with special mention given to the peas. 'The peas look great; they're a bit more creative,' they say. Tasting their dinner, the women, who seem visibly surprised give it thumbs up, praising the 'rustic' taste and look of the meal. Lamb tortilla stacks To make the lamb keema Ingredients: 450G lean lamb mince; two teaspoons sunflower or vegetable oil; one large onion, peeled and finely chopped; two garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped or crushed; one inch piece fresh root ginger, peeled and finely chopped; one or two 1-2 green chillies, deseeded (if preferred) and finely chopped; two teaspoons ground cumin; three tablespoons garam masala or medium curry powder; four medium tomatoes, chopped; one or two teaspoons white sugar; two tablespoons tomato purée; salt and freshly milled black pepper; 100g fresh or frozen peas; large handful freshly chopped coriander, to garnish Method: Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and cook the onion and garlic over a low heat for 10 minutes or until soft and lightly golden. Add the ginger, chillies, cumin and garam masala or curry powder. Cook over a moderate heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the lamb and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, then add the tomatoes, sugar, tomato purée and bring to the boil. Season, reduce the heat and gently simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a little water, if needed. 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time add the peas. To make the stacks Ingredients: Four to six corn or flour tortillas;100g grated mild hard cheese such as cheddar Method: Preheat the oven to Gas mark 6/200°C/400°F. Place a tortilla on a large non-stick baking tray and spoon over a portion of the mince mixture evenly and a handful of cheese. Repeat with the remaining ingredients finishing with the cheese. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the cheese melts. Cut into equal portions and serve with salad. Tip: If preferred scatter some baby spinach on top of each keema layer."

On Twitter, users can already track how many of these emoticons from the emoji list of designs are tweeted every second, using Emoji Tracker. And now a developer has taken the most popular designs and plotted them on a globe to see these emojis being tweeted worldwide, in real time. The Silicon Feelings globe, pictured, was created by Dallas developer Bradley Griffith. It shows the most popular 400 emojis, according to website Emoji Tracker, that are being posted on Twitter in real time. Griffith said only tweets that contain geolocation data appear A study in April found that the top trending word of the year, so far, is emoji – the small digital images used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication - which are continuing to spread like wildfire online. The words and phrases were plucked from among millions used online in social media, blogs and global media. Other terms to make the list include 'futebol’, and 'ghost plane' - relating to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. The Silicon Feelings project was built by Dallas Developer Bradley Griffith. He used the Emoji Tracker, which highlights the use of the emoticons on Twitter, to find the 400 most commonly used designs – out of a list of approximately 800. These include smiley faces, winking faces, love hearts, food items, travel-related emojis, and more. But, because so many emoticons are tweeted every second – so much so, Emoji Tracker comes with an epilepsy warning – Griffith chose to only plot the tweets that contain geolocation data. This means a user has opted in to reveal their location each time they tweet. The globe spins slowly on its axis around the equator, but clicking the image and dragging it with the mouse cursor lets viewers pinpoint particular countries and regions.

The Earth textures were created by designer Tom Patterson at Shadedrelief.com, while the font is called Rayon and was created by Sergey Yakunin. High-resolution emoji images were then taken from Greaterweb. Griffith explained: ‘I'm a developer and wannabe designer currently living in Dallas. ‘I released Silicon Feelings as a small offering to the internet and effort to learn some technologies I've been meaning to learn.' Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online. However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture' (e) + 'letter' (moji). Icons are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese curry, and sushi. Some emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could now be added. Twitter allowed emoji to be used on its web version, as well across its apps, last month."

""LIVESTRONG,"" they urge. In the wake of Wednesday's release of hundreds of pages of evidence supporting persistent allegations of doping against the legendary cyclist, there's another take on the wristband. Critics have struck out the ""V"" to make it read what they accuse Armstrong of doing for more than a decade: ""LIE STRONG."" Evidence of Armstrong doping 'overwhelming,' agency says Still, the flood of less-than-flattering details doesn't seem to be shaking the resolve of fans accustomed to accusations that have swirled for more than a decade, accusations the seven-time winner of cycling's most prestigious event -- the Tour de France -- has resolutely denied. The information released Wednesday by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency is part of a report to international cycling officials supporting the organization's request to strip Armstrong of his tour titles and other accolades. He is also subject to a lifetime ban on competition in events sanctioned by U.S. Olympic sports bodies. Armstrong's fans took to Facebook and other social media venues to stand by the man many see less as an athletic titan and more as an inspirational cancer survivor who has raised millions for cancer research and assistance. ""Whether you did, or you didn't, you still won 7 tour titles, you never failed a test and what you have done to increase the awareness of cancer, is enormous,"" one fan wrote on his Facebook fan page. ""Believe me, no one can tarnish the good you have done,"" wrote another. It's too soon to tell what the release of evidence against Armstrong and his teammates, many of whom admitted doping, will ultimately have on Armstrong's charity efforts and his overall reputation. However, his foundation says contributions increased after his August announcement that he would give up fighting the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's investigation of him. ""Our donations have increased to nearly double their usual amount since August,"" said Katherine McLane, spokeswoman for the Lance Armstrong Foundation. ""He's a person who helped change the perception of cancer survivors around the world. He's done an incredible amount of good for people affected by cancer and nothing can change that,"" she said. Armstrong won his seven Tour de France championships after being diagnosed in 1996 with testicular cancer, which spread to his lungs, lymph nodes, abdomen and brain. By December of that year, after months of surgery and treatment, doctors declared him cancer free. The following year, he established his foundation. Three years after his diagnosis, Armstrong won the first of his seven Tour de France titles, thrilling and inspiring millions in his home country, where cycling is barely followed. His victory brought increased attention to the sport in the United States and helped raised money and attention for cancer research worldwide. Still, throughout it all, rumors and allegations of doping dogged the Texas native. In 2002, a 21-month investigation into allegations that Armstrong's team used banned substances during the 2000 Tour de France closed after finding no evidence of illegal drug use. The International Cycling Union released a report in 2006 clearing him of allegations from 1999. And in February, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles closed a two-year investigation into the allegations without filing charges. In the latest investigation, the USADA said examination of old Armstrong blood samples seemed to indicated doping. Its report also said Armstrong made a ""financial agreement"" to bury a positive test for a banned substance and accused the team of falsifying prescription records to cover corticosteroid use by Armstrong. The file also contains affidavits from Armstrong's teammates implicating themselves, and Armstrong, in the cheating. Armstrong's teammates recount tricking drug testers The agency said its investigation ""found proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Lance Armstrong engaged in serial cheating through the use, administration and trafficking of performance enhancing drugs and methods and that Armstrong participated in running the US Postal Service Team as a doping conspiracy."" ""The evidence in the case against Lance Armstrong is beyond strong; it is as strong as, or stronger than, that presented in any case brought by USADA over the initial twelve years of USADA's existence,"" said the organization, which is not a governmental agency but is designated by Congress as the country's official anti-doping organization for Olympic sports. Armstrong himself hasn't commented directly on the case. He posted to Twitter Wednesday night, however, saying he was ""hanging with my family, unaffected"" and thinking about an upcoming event for his charity. His lawyer, Tim Herman, called the agency's report a ""one-sided hatchet job"" and a ""government-funded witch hunt."" A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles, which ran the investigation that was closed in February, declined to comment on whether the evidence released publicly Wednesday would spur renewed interest in possible criminal sanctions against Armstrong or anyone else associated with the team. Bruce Deming, a former federal prosecutor and avid amateur cyclist himself, said he doubted the criminal case would be reopened. ""The feds knew what USADA knew. USADA knew what the feds knew. So this is not new information to the prosecutors, I don't think,"" he said. In fact, he said, he suspects the information revealed Wednesday is largely similar to what federal prosecutors unveiled. ""This investigation against Lance, which you know involved multiple federal agencies and a very large, well-organized federal investigation and what has to be millions of dollars spent, came up with apparently not enough hard evidence to charge Lance Armstrong with a parking ticket,"" Deming said. Still, the report has had an impact on some fans, for whom the evidence appeared to sour their opinion of Armstrong. ""I am sad and have finally accepted there really are no true heroes in our world,"" one Facebook fan wrote. ""On behalf of pretty much everyone who has held you in high regard... Looked on as an idol in the wake of your excellence in your sport... Bought your books and aspired to be as (successful) as you are... If the allegations are true then you have duped your country and fellow athletes,"" wrote another. Still, Howard Bragman, an expert in crisis communications, said he does not expect the accusations will have any significant impact on Armstrong's legacy. ""He's done amazing things for people with cancer,"" Bragman said. ""He's given a lot of people hope in this world. And to many millions of Americans and people around the world, Lance Armstrong will always be a hero. And none of these allegations are ever going to change that.""

Back in March 2004, Prince William confirmed rumours he was dating Pippa's sister Kate, now his wife the Duchess of Cambridge, when they were pictured together on a ski holiday in Klosters. Then last month, Prince Harry threw caution to the wind when he was pictured publicly embracing his new girlfriend Cressida Bonas while they were skiing in Verbier.

The pair pause to look in the window of a jewellery store on the High Street Now Pippa has confirmed the new love of her life is Nico by taking a romantic stroll with him in St Moritz where they walked along the street with their arms around each other. The pair went for lunch with friends in the Swiss resort last week where they were seen pausing to look at a jewellery store's window display as they strolled arm-in-arm. They were both wrapped up for the wintry weather with Pippa wearing a beanie hat, fur gloves and a beige knitted cardigan from Celtic & Co.

Earlier this year the Philadelphia-born singer received an honorary doctorate from Temple University and was photographed receiving it from Cosby. The comedian resigned from the university’s board of trustees on Tuesday after several weeks of old accusations resurfacing. Singer Jill Scott has come in for flak from her fans after repeatedly tweeting her support for Bill Cosby after a series of rape allegations made against him resurfaced in recent weeks Last week one of Scott’s followers tweeted her a link to a petition asking Temple to end its relationship with Cosby - but she instead tweeted her support for the comedian Last week one of Scott’s followers tweeted her a link to a petition asking Temple to end its relationship with Cosby. Instead of supporting the cause, Scott tweeted her support for the 77-year-old comedian and actor. ‘So they've proven the alleged allegations? I didn't know. Will they also be giving him back the millions he's donated?’ she tweeted. The singer soon started receiving a number of tweets from followers expressing their disappointment and even anger with her stance. ‘Disappointed in Jill. Did u need an indictment to believe mike Browns family?,' tweeted one fan. On November 30, another follower tweeted that Scott wasn’t respecting her platform as an influential performer regarding her tweets in support of Cosby. The Philadelphia-born singer received an honorary doctorate from Temple University in May and was photographed receiving it from Cosby Scott has repeatedly stood by her support for Cosby in discussions on Twitter with followers who have taken her to task 'It’s hearsay in a court of law. Tis all. Trust. If this is true, he’ll face his due just like everyone,' she said in one tweet. 'For a world traveled, educated, woman AND mother to take up for a man who has abused women in his past is disheartening,' hit back one person Scott then posted another tweet saying, 'I’m respecting a man who has done more for the image of Brown people that almost anyone EVER. From Fat Albert to the Huxtables.' The singer continued to defend Cosby as recently as yesterday whens he accused the media and society of 'attempting to destroy his magnificent legacy'. After multiple Twitter exchanges defending Cosby, Scott tweeted about rape calling it a cowardly crime and advising her followers to 'GET EVIDENCE' if raped. 'Rape is a despicable, cowardly crime. If you’ve been raped- plz do NOT shower, go to police IMMEDIATELY, have a rap (sic) kit done. GET EVIDENCE.' On Monday Scott accused the media and society of attempting to destroy Cosby's 'magnificent legacy' Tears: Dickinson, 59, broke down during the CNN interview, where she said Cosby had given her a pill which made her black out, and that she woke up after he raped her On CNN on Monday night, Janice Dickinson described in graphic detail how Bill Cosby allegedly drugged then raped her in a Lake Tahoe hotel room more than 30 years ago. The former supermodel, 59, broke down in tears during the live television interview and accused Cosby of using the offer of career advancement to lure her to a hotel room where he drugged her and raped her while she was unconscious. Dickinson said she recalled waking up in extreme pain with Cosby's semen staining her clothes, after which she fled. Cosby's resignation from Temple was also announced on Monday, he had been a trustee since 1982 and was a frequent visitor, commencement speaker and attendee at basketball games. In the statement, first obtained by The Philadelphia Inquirer, Cosby said: 'I have always been proud of my association with Temple University. Speech: The 77-year-old comedian and actor, who had been a trustee since 1982, was a frequent visitor, commencement speaker (pictured) and attendee at basketball games at the Philadelphia-based institution 'I have always wanted to do what would be in the best interests of the university and its students. As a result, I have tendered my resignation from the Temple University Board of Trustees.' Patrick O’Connor, chairman of the board of trustees, said that Cosby does not want to be a distraction to his colleagues. He added that the board 'accepts Dr. Cosby's resignation from the board and thanks him for his service to the university'. The resignation is believed to be effective immediately. Mr O'Connor had defended Cosby in a 2005 civil suit filed by a former Temple basketball employee, who accused the star of molesting her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion a year earlier. Cosby, who has been with his wife Camille for the last 51 years, and the woman later settled for undisclosed terms. But since the lawsuit was filed, at least 17 other alleged victims have come forward to claim that the star drugged and sexually abused them in decades past. Chatting: Cosby is pictured stopping to talk with a Temple cheerleader as he makes his way to the sidelines The comedian has strongly denied any wrongdoing and has never been criminally charged. His lawyer has previously called the allegations 'unsubstantiated' and 'discredited'. Cosby's decision to resign from the board of trustees reportedly follows a series of high-level talks by university leaders, many of whom had spoken in support of the Temple graduate. It also follows many other universities' decisions to sever ties with the star, who has donated millions of dollars to numerous academic institutions, and has close links to many others. The University of Massachusetts Amherst, where Cosby got his graduate degrees, recently said it had asked him to step down as honorary co-chairman of its $300 million fundraising campaign. And the Berklee College of Music will reportedly no longer award a scholarship in his name. At Temple, an online petition urging the university to cut ties with Cosby had garnered more than 1,000 signatures by Monday afternoon."

The rising numbers of Americans with no religious affiliation is on the rise, which led to the percentage of Protestant adults in the U.S. reaching a new low of 48 per cent. This is the first time that Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life has reported with certainty that the number has fallen below 50 per cent. The drop has long been anticipated and comes at a time when there no Protestants are on the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Republicans have their first presidential ticket with no Protestant nominees. Among the reasons for the change are the growth in nondenominational Christians who can no longer be categorised as Protestant, and a spike in the number of American adults who say they have no religion. The Pew study, released Tuesday, found that about 20 per cent of Americans say they have no religious affiliation, an increase from 15 per cent in the last five years. Scholars have long debated whether people who say they no longer belong to a religious group should be considered secular. While the category as defined by Pew researchers includes atheists, it also encompasses majorities of people who say they believe in God, and a notable minority who pray daily or consider themselves 'spiritual' but not 'religious'. Still, Pew found overall that most of the unaffiliated aren't actively seeking another religious home, indicating that their ties with organised religion are permanently broken. Changing times: America's religious make-up has changed greatly in the 400 years since the Pilgrims first arrived on the Mayflower From 1972 to 2010: The Pew Report shows how the Protestant faith has declined in the U.S. over 40 years The research shows that religion is declining among the younger generation Growth among those with no religion has been a major preoccupation of American faith leaders who worry that the United States, a highly religious country, would go the way of Western Europe, where church attendance has plummeted. Pope Benedict XVI has partly dedicated his pontificate to combating secularism in the West. This week in Rome, he is convening a three-week synod, or assembly, of bishops from around the world aimed at bringing back Roman Catholics who have left the church. The trend also has political implications. American voters who describe themselves as having no religion vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. Pew found Americans with no religion support abortion rights and gay marriage at a much higher-rate than the U.S. public at large. These 'nones' are an increasing segment of voters who are registered as Democrats or lean toward the party, growing from 17 per cent to 24 per cent over the last five years. The religiously unaffiliated are becoming as important a constituency to Democrats as evangelicals are to Republicans, Pew said. Five years of changing beliefs: Atheism and agnosticism is growing at the expense of Christianity Cathedral Bari in Puglia, Italy: Church buildings are a staple of European life, but attendances are plummeting No Republican nominees are Protestant: Republican nominee Mitt Romney, for example, is Mormon Neither agnostic or atheist: The rise of the 'nothing in particular' The Pew analysis, conducted with PBS' 'Religion & Ethics Newsweekly', is based on several surveys, including a poll of nearly 3,000 adults conducted June 28-July 9, 2012. The finding on the Protestant majority is based on responses from a larger group of more than 17,000 people and has a margin of error of plus or minus 0.9 percentage points, Pew researchers said. Pew said it had also previously calculated a drop slightly below 50 percent among U.S. Protestants, but those findings had fallen within the margin of error. The General Social Survey, which is conducted by the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center, reported for 2010 that the percentage of U.S. Protestants was around 46.7 percent. Researchers have been struggling for decades to find a definitive reason for the steady rise in those with no religion.' The spread of secularism in Western Europe was often viewed as a byproduct of growing wealth in the region. Yet among industrialised nations, the United States stood out for its deep religiosity in the face of increasing wealth. Mormons attend a service: America may see its first President hailing from this faith if Republican Mitt Romney wins the election Now, religion scholars say the decreased religiosity in the United States could reflect a change in how Americans describe their religious lives. Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee (in black) are the most Protestant states, according to the studies In 2007, 60 percent of people who said they seldom or never attend religious services still identified themselves as part of a particular religious tradition. In 2012, that statistic fell to 50 percent, according to the Pew report. 'Part of what's going on here is that the stigma associated with not being part of any religious community has declined,' said John Green, a specialist in religion and politics at the University of Akron, who advised Pew on the survey. 'In some parts of the country, there is still a stigma. But overall, it's not the way it used to be.' The Pew study has found the growth in unaffiliated Americans spans a broad range of groups: men and women, college graduates and those without a college degree, people earning less than $30,000 annually and those earning $75,000 or more. However, along ethnic lines, the largest jump in 'nones' has been among whites. One-fifth of whites describe themselves as having no religion. More growth in 'nones' is expected. One-third of adults under age 30 have no religious affiliation, compared to nine  per cent of people 65 and older. Pew researchers wrote that 'young adults today are much more likely to be unaffiliated than previous generations were at a similar stage in their lives', and aren't expected to become more religiously active as they age."

The grandmother, who would only give her names as Lorel, said she went to the fast food chain in Richmond, Central Virginia, on Sunday night to buy dinner. However she was left horrified and upset after she was handed a receipt with the offensive phrase printed at the top. Offensive: An elderly woman and her daughter-in-law were handed this receipt at a Burger King in Virginia which labelled them as 'b**** a** hoes' In an interview with CBS 6 she said: 'This is more than an insult. I mean calling you names on a piece of a paper, that will hurt somebody. 'I liked going there. But after this they won’t get my business anymore.' Speaking about the manager, she added: 'He did apologise. He also called the young lady over and asked her, ""did you see this?"" She just shook her head. He said it had never happened before.' According to the TV station a dsitrict manager of Burger King said the chain was 'dealing with it', and that they were using CCTV tapes to try and track down the culprit. Lorel is not the first person to be insulted on a receipt. In April last year a father received the note 'f****** needy kids' on his bill after asking for an extra chicken leg for his son. The grandmother, who gave her name as Lorel, said she will not go back to the restaurant (file pic) Joseph Gibson stopped at a St Louis bar called Friendly's on a day out with his son when the incident happened. The store manager later apologised, saying a female waitress had put it on the bill as a joke, intending to remove it before handing it over. In November last year a lesbian waitress and former Marine also posted a receipt showing on offensive letter a family had apparently left for her instead of tipping. The note, left for Danya Morales, 22, at the Bridgewater Bistro in New Jersey, said: 'Sorry, I cannot tip because I do not agree with your lifestyle and the way you live your life'. Ms Morales then received thousands of dollars in donations after she claimed to be collecting for a gay rights charity. However following protests from the family, and no money being given to the charity, Ms Morales admitted the receipt had been a fake and was fired."

Slovenian Milanic has signed a two-year contract at Elland Road after being headhunted by Leeds sporting director Nicola Salerno. The 46-year-old left Austrian Sturm Graz on Sunday just weeks into his second season in charge, having previously taken Maribor to multiple league tiles and participation in the Champions League. Slovenian Darko Milanic has been appointed as manager of troubled Leeds United Leeds owner Massimo Cellino, speaking with Brian McDermott, has a reputation for sacking managers Cellino sacked 36 managers in 22 years at his previous club Cagliari, and terminated Milanic’s predecessor Dave Hockaday’s reign after just six matches and 70 days. However, Milanic shrugged off the statistics, reflecting that managerial life expectancies are short anyway. “Our job is at risk on every game, I have to do my best. It doesn’t worry me,” he said, at his unveiling this morning. “I’m very motivated and excited about the new job at Leeds United. I know this is a big traditional club with great supporters and they have very good quality in the team.” Former Leeds manager Dave Hockaday lost his job after only six games in charge at Elland Road Salerno, who flanked Milanic at the press conference, hinted at further recruits from the continent after revealing multilingual qualities as one of the new coach’s biggest attractions. “We need an international coach because we have an international team,” Salerno said. However, Milanic confirmed that Leeds’ habitual caretaker manager Neil Redfearn, who steered the Championship club to three wins and a draw in his recent stint in charge, will remain in the dugout for Saturday’s match against Brentford and beyond. “In the first moment, it’s important to keep the ethusiasm. But I want to make some changes tactically,” said Milanic, who took his first training session on Tuesday. “I will speak to Neil over the next few days because he knows the team very well. If I need to know something I will talk to him.” Souleymane Doukara (C) scores against Huddersfield during Leeds god run under Neil Redfearn Milanic is the eighth permanent managerial appointment Leeds have made since they dropped out of the Premier League 10 years ago and his primary task is to return them there with haste. “When we talked last Sunday he told me my job is to make the squad better to stay better on the field and to be prepared to play in the Premier League,” he said, of his conversations with Cellino. “I made a great job with Maribor but not in one month. I have no time limit. I have to do a great job as soon as possible.”"

Well now you can, thanks to a unique pen that 'writes' with warm thermoplastic that hardens within seconds. The pen can used to create stunning replicas of some of the world's most famous sculptures and buildings, including the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben. Scroll down for video 3Doodler from Boston has revealed their 3D-printing pen (shown). It expels melted plastic which then cools to create 3D objects in mid-air. The pen has three 'writing' speeds to allow for different levels of complexity. Artists can also download blueprints to recreate famous landmarks To create their designs, users download blueprints of world-renowned landmarks, trace them on paper to create plastic lines, and then mend them together with the special 3D pen. Another pen on the market comes from London-based Lix (shown above). Their pen is 6.45in (16.3 cm) long, 0.55in (1.4 cm) in diameter and weighs 1.23 ounces (34.9 grams). It is made of aluminium and comes in black or grey. Inside the pen it heats plastic to 150°C (300°F), which is then pushed out through the nib as a hot liquid at the touch of a button. The plastic used is a plant-based filament, although it can also use stronger forms of plastic. When the liquid is exposed to air it solidifies into shapes. It will retail for £85 ($139.95) when it goes on sale in September. The pen itself is powered by an AC cord and it heats up in less than a minute. Users can then choose from three 'writing' speeds and more than 12 colours - including black, red, yellow, green and blue - to create their designs. At 7.5 inches (19cm) long, 1.5 inches (3.8cm) in diameter, the £99 pen (US RRP $99) is portable and designs take around two hours to complete. The pen is plugged in to a power source via its cable to be recharged. It can melt two types of plastic, ABS and PLA, with the former being heated to 230°C (445°F) and the latter 210°C (410°F). It is distributed by Firebox in the UK and Hammacher Schlemmerin the US. A spokeswoman from Hammacher Schlemmer said: 'Instead of releasing ink, this pen extrudes warm thermoplastic that hardens within seconds, allowing you to create three-dimensional freehand drawings. 'Artists can download blueprints of a 6-inch (15cm) tall Eiffel Tower, a napkin holder, or even Istanbul's Sultan Ahmed Mosque. 'They can then trace the designs and mend them together with the 3D pen, creating hand-drawn three-dimensional objects. 'Since the plastic hardens quickly, users can draw in the air to create a bird's outstretched wing or connect two faces of a cube.' The pen heats plastic to temperatures of up to 230°C (445°F) to create the structures and also has a fan (seen above) to make sure that it doesn't overheat when it is being held. The expelled thermoplastic hardens within seconds to form objects in mid-air"

Heynckes is currently in his third spell as Bayern coach having taken over from Dutchman Louis van Gaal in 2011. After a second-place finish in the Bundesliga last season, Heynckes' team lead the table by nine points at the halfway stage of the 2012/13 campaign. Guardiola had been heavily linked with a move to England, with Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United all rumored to be interested in appointing him. The former Barca captain seemed to fuel those rumors by telling the English Football Association's website: ""I've always found English football very fascinating, just for the environment, the crowd and the supporters. ""As a player, I couldn't realize my dream to play there but I hope in the future, I have a challenge to be a coach or a manager there and feel the experience of all the coaches and players that have been there. ""It is unique, to play in that league. I want to feel the supporters, the environment, the media and the style of the players and everything. ""I am still young, just 41, so I hope in the future I could be able to train there and enjoy that."""

Now retired, the 30-year law enforcement veteran reveals trade secrets about how he ""made friends"" with criminals and coaxed them to confess. For example, take Paul Eugene Rowles -- a convicted murderer and sexual predator who died last year in a Florida prison. When he was with Metro-Dade Police in 1972, Frank arrested Rowles for the strangling death of Rowles' Miami neighbor, Linda Fida. Frank, who spoke with CNN by phone, described the handsome, 6-foot, blue-eyed Rowles as ""someone you trust right away, very pleasant to talk to, soft spoken, somebody you wouldn't think would be a dangerous killer. But these killers are the most dangerous of all."" For them, Frank said, killing is ""like an addiction, like heroin, and they've gotta have that murder fix."" So, how did Frank get Rowles to confess? ""I made friends with him,"" he said matter-of-factly. ""It took half an hour."" But he didn't do it alone. ""I had another cop in the room with me, and we knew each other's methods. The other detective just stayed quiet. He was there for support, but not to be a part of the interrogation."" Sitting close to Rowles with his knees almost touching him, Frank said he would lean toward him during the interrogation. ""I was really appearing to be interested in him,"" Frank said. Then they started talking about how Rowles' life, family, father and mother had all affected him and ""how that led to what he had just done."" And then Rowles began ""blathering the confession out,"" Frank said. ""He started crying."" Although Rowles was sentenced to life in prison, he was paroled in 1985. Nine years later Rowles was convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a minor and sentenced to 19 years. In 2012, DNA testing linked Rowles to the 1992 murder of 21-year-old Elizabeth Foster. Before Rowles died last year, police tried to interview him, without success, to determine if he was behind the disappearance of 20-year-old Tiffany Sessions in 1989. After his death, investigators found a journal in Rowles' cell with a note that read ""2/9/89"" -- the date Sessions disappeared. ""No. 2"" was scrawled on both sides of the notation. Police believe it's an indication that Sessions was Rowles' second victim. Read more about Rowles In 2003, Frank played a very different role in another Florida murder case. While researching a crime novel, Frank began corresponding with James Duckett, a former police officer who was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1987 murder of an 11-year-old girl named Teresa McAbee. Duckett has been on death row for more than 25 years, as the appeals process plays out. Frank sat face-to-face with Duckett in a prison lunchroom, a conversation both men describe in CNN's documentary series, ""Death Row Stories,"" airing this Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. See more about Duckett and Frank Successfully interrogating suspects one-on-one, Frank said, requires patience. ""You can't come across as though you're personally involved,"" he said. ""You can't come across like you're mad or angry or impatient or putting pressure on. Real jailhouse police questioning doesn't happen the way it's portrayed by Hollywood. According to Frank, the clichÃ©, the two-cops-on-one-suspect scenario with angry, screaming interrogators isn't part of the real world. We've broken down Frank's method into three ideas: 1. ""The most important thing is gaining their confidence, respect and cooperation."" Frank repeated his theme: ""I just kinda made friends."" 2. ""At the beginning of the interrogation you don't even go into what you're there for. You wait five minutes. Wait 15 minutes, 30 minutes. There's no hurry. What you want to do is get the person talking and feeling good about talking to you."" 3. ""Eventually you just work your way into whatever the issue is. Next thing you know, someone's just blathering a confession. Believe me that's how it worked."" 'I just got a hunch' During all his years on the force, Frank claims he never arrested the wrong person in a case. But he came close. Frank told a story about a case where he questioned a man whose aunt accused him of raping her. ""During the interrogation he was adamant that he didn't do it,"" Frank recalled. ""Well of course a lot of guilty people are adamant that they didn't do it. But I just got a hunch â€” something about the guy. So I started thinking, 'Maybe we ought to check this out further before we actually book him.' We went back out on the streets, and we found the aunt again, and we polygraphed her. After polygraphing her, she admitted that she had told a lie."" Frank said it turned out the aunt had ""an ulterior motive about her wanting to have him arrested."" He then freed the suspect. The 'conveyor belt' After three decades as a law enforcement officer, Frank has some opinions about America's justice system. Public defender resources are overburdened, Frank said. Which sometimes contributes to less than fair circumstances. ""It's really an uneven system to have people who can afford a good attorney and other people who can only afford public defenders,"" Frank said. ""I asked a public defender once, 'How do you keep up with the caseload?' And he said, 'It's like Lucille Ball and the conveyor belt: You just can't keep up with it.'"" A lot of public defenders are talented and would like to do a better job, Frank said. ""But they're constrained by the enormous stresses and the pressures to keep up with their caseloads. The death penalty CNN's ""Death Row Stories"" draws back the curtain on how murder cases are investigated and prosecuted. It connects the judicial dots between the crimes, the evidence, the trial and the death chamber. Frank joked about his days as a ""hotshot detective,"" when he used to favor the use of the death penalty in some cases. But in the years after his retirement in 1990, Frank has turned a 180 on the issue. Now 73, Frank has been writing crime novels, which require many hours of research. ""The death penalty is something I researched a lot about,"" he said. ""How many times do we find people who've had life sentences and 25 years later DNA proves them to be innocent? Those same people could easily have been executed by now. I'm sure that there have been people executed who are innocent."" That's just not acceptable, he said. ""I've realized that society can't sacrifice some innocent people once in a while just so it can get all the guilty ones."" Frank said society should consider alternative punishments for dangerous criminals. ""Because, basically, putting someone to death is murder,"" Frank said. ""It's intentional murder. Premeditated murder. Isn't it?"" Are overburdened defense attorneys breaking America's justice system? What do you think? Tell us in the comments below.

Expectations had been high with Argentina hosting the tournament and seeking a record 15th title, but ""La Albiceleste"" lost on penalties in the quarterfinals to neighbors Uruguay -- who went on to claim that milestone instead. Batista, a World Cup winner as a player in 1986, replaced the iconic Diego Maradona as coach in July 2010, having previously guided his country's Olympic team to a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Games. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) hopes to announce a successor to the 48-year-old former Argentinos Juniors boss within a week. Copa America flops: Who is to blame? ""The national teams committee has decided to rescind the contract that attached Mr. Batista with the Argentinian Football Association,"" AFA spokesman Ernesto Cherquis Bialo told reporters. ""In a very good-natured, mature telephone conversation, Mr. Batista and Mr. Julio Grondona (the AFA president) talked and Batista left his situation in the hands of the AFA. ""Batista is a man who does not need any explanation. He talked to the AFA president and allowed him to decide whatever he considers the right thing."" Cherquis Bialo said the AFA would now take time to consider potential candidates to replace Batista. ""In the upcoming seven days, we hope we can reveal the name of the new coach. The candidates' names will be evaluated by the national teams committee,"" he said. The main objective for the new head coach will be qualification for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, a campaign which begins on October 7 with a home match against Chile. Also at Monday's press conference, the AFA announced sweeping changes to the structure of league football in Argentina. Has Argentine football reached crisis point? The country's top division currently consists of 20 teams, with each year split into two championship seasons. Each team plays each other once to decide the winner of the first competition, known as the Apertura, with the return fixtures making up the second championship, the Clausura. However, the new regulations with see the country's top two divisions combined from the start of the 2012-13 campaign to create a 38-team league. The new format will see teams compete for the title over a full season, eliminating the Apertura and Clausura system. It is also spells the end of the Primera Division's current relegation format, which sees teams relegated based on their points over three Apertura and Clausura seasons. The 33-time national champions River Plate suffered relegation under the current rules for the first time in their history in June, and CNN correspondent Brian Byrnes believe the plight of the Buenos Aires outfit may have brought about these changes. ""A lot of people reacted very badly to that,"" Byrnes said of River's relegation. ""They knew a lot of lost revenue was going to come as a result of River playing in the B league. ""So we're hearing that authorities both at the AFA and even the Argentine government were involved in the decision to combine the two leagues. ""It's not clear yet how they are going to sort out the scoring or how it is going to affect international competitions, such as they Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sudamericana."""

In an exclusive interview with CNN, Lebedev conceded he may have gone too far but insisted he was acting in self-defense when he launched his extraordinary assault on Polonsky. ""I felt threatened,"" he said. ""My point was I need to stop it otherwise it's going to go into not only an insult and intimidation but a hit in the face. ""I might have over-reacted: normally I'm a very quiet person ... I was not looking for any violation of public order."" Lebedev, who was described by the Investigative Committee as a lawmaker in the Kirov region, has been charged with hooliganism and assault motivated by political hatred, the same offense for which members of punk band Pussy Riot were jailed this year. On Monday the band members launched an appeal against their sentence, which followed their performance of a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in one of Moscow's grandest cathedrals. The Pussy Riot charges sparked international concern about freedom of speech in Russia, and Lebedev said his case is similar. ""How could political hatred emerge from a completely cut-out and edited discussion about some murky subject of the world economic crisis? Why should it be considered hooliganism? It's the same as the Pussy Riot case. It's clearly a political case. All motivation is political; everything else is fabrication."" He said the charge against him is ""completely unsubstantiated but carrying a heavy sentence and prison."" He said he could have left the country but wanted to stay in Russia to fight the charges and air his concerns about the political direction of his country. Questioned if it is true that wealthy Russian businessmen should not get involved in politics if they want to stay on the right side of the Kremlin, Lebedev agreed. ""It's a rule. It clearly exists,"" he said. ""I thought I'm not a politician, just a publisher of a paper and I'm also a citizen who might, from time to time, voice concerns about things. ""I'm still defending the position that it would be much wiser for Putin to install real European quality, adapted to Russian realities and institutions with competition between political forces."" He said he is prepared to pay a heavy price for his principles, but hopes he won't go to prison. In the meantime, ""I'll stay and face the charges and go for a trial."""

""We are enormously concerned,"" Baltimore police spokesman Anthony J. Guglielmi said Friday. ""Every day that passes we get more and more freaked out."" Phylicia Barnes, a Charlotte, North Carolina, resident who was in Baltimore to visit her college-age half-sister, was last seen December 28, after saying she was going out to get something to eat and maybe a haircut, Guglielmi said. As recently as Tuesday, police said they had no evidence that foul play was involved in her disappearance. But now they say she has not made contact with friends or family, and hasn't turned on her cell phone, used an ATM or updated her social media sites since she disappeared. The FBI did a profile on the girl and found no reason she would run away, Guglielmi said. She is a good student with no emotional disturbances in her life, he said. ""The fact set of this case is different than anything else we've seen,"" he said. More than 100 Baltimore police, Maryland State Police troopers and FBI agents have been working around the clock to find out what happened to Barnes, Guglielmi said. Police have questioned a dozen people believed to have had contact with her in the hours before she disappeared, and have searched the homes and cars of some of those people, he said. They also have collected 40 hours of video from surveillance cameras at nearby businesses and apartment buildings, but neither those videos nor searches conducted in two locations have helped give investigators any leads, Guglielmi said. On Thursday, they turned to posting billboards along I-95 in hope of gathering information about the girl's fate. ""What's going to break this thing wide open is that somebody, whether it's (in) Kansas or Canada, is going to say, wait a minute, I just saw her in a diner,"" Guglielmi said Friday. ""That's in the best case."" Although Guglielmi said there was no evidence of illegal drug use at the apartment, the girl's mother, Janice Sallis, said she has been told the girl may have been allowed to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana at her half-sister's apartment, according to CNN and CNN affiliate WSOC. Sallis said she had been told up to 20 men had come and gone while her daughter was there. ""I pray to God that my daughter is fine and she'll be found safe,"" Barnes' father, Russell Barnes, told CNN affiliate WBAL.

But it seems that birds, like drivers, do have to stick to a speed limit. According to researchers in the U.S., birds must fly below a certain speed to avoid crashing into trees and other obstacles. If they go over the limit, it becomes more difficult to spot objects they could hit. And with the absence of any helpful road signs on their routes, they have to work out their safe maximum speed themselves – taking into account factors including their size and manoeuvrability, as well as how built-up the area they are flying through is. Way forward: Scientists have discovered that birds intuitively know how fast to fly - and hope to use this research to improve unmanned robots travelling through built-up areas The researchers, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, believe their findings could help defence experts programme unmanned drones to fly as fast as possible without crashing. They looked at birds such as the daredevil northern goshawk and developed mathematical models based on the way the animals travel through the air. Study author Professor Emilio Frazzoli said: ‘If birds flew at speeds purely based on what they can immediately see, they wouldn’t go very fast.’ Instead, he explained, they roughly calculate the density of the environment they are flying through and set themselves a top speed based on the likelihood of finding a gap between the trees or buildings. Above that top speed, he went on, they are ‘sure to crash’. But if they stay below it, they could theoretically remain in flight forever. Professor Frazzoli, who is currently testing his theory on pigeons, added: ‘There is no magic number for the critical speed. In fact, the critical speed depends on some parameters describing tree density and size, and the bird’s manoeuvrability and size. ‘In other words, if the forest is too dense, the trees are too thick, the bird is too large or flying too fast, it will eventually collide with a tree.’ He said that ‘mathematical calculations’ drawn from the way birds fly could eventually be used by scientists to increase the speed unmanned drones can safely fly at."

Seeing it again, though, I think I know why. Twenty-eight years later, ""TRON"" exerts a campy-surreal, here's what the future looked like before it arrived fascination that it never enjoyed during its initial run. In 1982, when it was the closest thing Disney had to a picture for adults, it was basically a demo reel of special effects in search of a movie. Yet if you see it today, it can stand as the first prehistoric Hollywood version of cyberspace, and it's fun to behold the eager, at times shockingly primitive ways that it imagines the ''wondrous'' computer future: as a frictionless Colorforms grid that looks like the most analog of head trips. Few science-fiction films have been simultaneously so ahead of their time and so instantly, touchingly dated -- so behind the eight ball of their own technology. ""TRON"" made the virtual almost leadenly literal. It was the soul of a new machine locked inside the hardware of an old one. The cult of ""TRON"" is hardly so big that you could accuse ""TRON: Legacy"" of being a cynical attempt to cash in on a franchise. (More than just a bomb, the first ""TRON"" was a major embarrassment for Disney; out-of-print DVD copies are now about as hard to hunt down as VHS head cleaners.) That said, the studio has had a long time to ponder its mistake, and ""TRON: Legacy,"" unlike its predecessor, really does make novelty look cool. It's a sleeker, sharper, far more visually intoxicating machine dream of a movie, with a darkly liquid electronic texture all its own. When Sam (Garrett Hedlund), the son of the now mysteriously vanished Kevin Flynn (Bridges), visits his dad's dusty, abandoned Flynn Arcade and ends up getting sucked -- through a ""TRON"" videogame! -- into the virtual world of the Grid, he gets outfitted for action (black uniform with neon piping), and then is thrust onto the combat stage of a gladiatorial thunderdome. There, he faces off against assorted digital soldiers, all wielding lethal Frisbees of light. The kitsch element is still there -- basically, this is the story of what it's like to be turned into a kill-or-be-killed videogame icon -- but the director, Joseph Kosinski, stages the extreme fighting with a fleet and threatening charge. The FX in ""TRON: Legacy"" have an almost Einsteinian elegance: They infuse light with gravity. If one of the discs hits a combatant, he'll shatter into glassy fragments, and Sam, absorbing the physics of the game, must learn to treat his body almost as part of the surrounding architecture. He becomes a ruthless digital specter. As long as it's engaged in light-hurling bouts of force, or motorcycle chases through a landscape so ominously enveloping it looks like ""Blade Runner"" after gentrification, ""TRON: Legacy"" is a catchy popcorn pleasure. The movie has a seductive, percolating, what's-old-is-new-again musical score by the French electronica duo Daft Punk, and for lengthy swatches of it I grooved on the look and the atmosphere. Joseph Kosinski's direction is just intriguing enough to leave you hoping that when Sam finally locates his father amid all those irradiated bytes and bits, the story will really take off. But ""TRON: Legacy"" turns out to be a little too much like one of those logy trapped-on-Planet X sci-fi movies from the 1950s: There's a lot of dramatic stasis undergirding the visual wow. It transpires that Bridges' Flynn hasn't been doing much for 20 years but sitting around -- the portal that would allow him to leave has been sealed off -- and his fascist nemesis, returning from the first film, is once again Clu, now played by a digitized version of the young Bridges. In his rubbery Botox-android way, he's creepy to look at (and he makes you wonder if this will be the future for aging movie stars), but there isn't much to Clu besides his telegenic blank stare. Here, as in ""TRON,"" there are limits to how much technology can really express. As Flynn, Bridges acts very beatnik Zen, like a weary cyber version of the Dude, and Michael Sheen is on hand as a sinister nightclub impresario who primps and soft-shoes like an albino Davy Jones wearing David Bowie's Aladdin Sane shag. Olivia Wilde, as Sam's cybernetic love interest, does some pretty standard punk-arm-candy posing. One reason the original ""TRON"" was greeted with so much hostility is that it seemed, in its cheesy synthesized way, to represent a brave new world not just of digital outer space, but of movies consumed by their own effects. At the time, this was a future a lot of people didn't want to see Hollywood embrace. But, of course, it's the future that won out. And that may be the true legacy of ""TRON."" The sequel, more successfully (if less innocently), injects you into a luminous action matrix and asks you to be happy with the ride. But it's easier now not to object.

Simply holding the contest was a bold move given that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LBGT) people in the country face continual legal challenges and discrimination, despite the fact homosexuality is legal. The pageant formed part of a week-long celebration of LGBT events held against a background of violence towards transgender sex workers.

According to a 2011 report by Amnesty International, hate crimes in Turkey towards gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people - including violent attacks and murders - are common but largely ignored by the authorities. But competitors in the pageant were determined to take a stand - and make the most out of the day.

Lined up on an old barn door in Merseyside, wildlife photographer Steve Ward captured the chicks bursting into life as their mum returned with food. It took Mr Ward three hours before he managed to photograph the great summer scene, but he said he left knowing he had some great shots and 'memories to cherish forever'. The quartet of chicks realised the birds in the centre of the group were more likely to get fed first by their mother, so they edged closer and closer together The moment the 'choir' of swallow chicks burst into song as the moment their mother returned with food was captured on camera by the patient photographer The group of swallows look rather grumpy as they sit patiently waiting for their mother to bring them their food The group appeared on the old barn door entrance in Merseyside three hours after Steve Ward arrived to try and photographed them as they fed Mr Ward, 35, from Crosby first saw the delightful birds as he drove home through the village. He said: 'I spotted these whilst driving home from work one day through Little Crosby Village. 'They were all lined up on an old barn door entrance that was blocked up with a fence panel to keep trespassers out. But these little intruders must have been reared in the barn and were now able to fly down on to the doorway to be fed by mum. 'At the time I never had my camera and knowing they would soon be fledging I went back the next day and after an early 6am start the birds appeared after three hours of waiting. 'They would line up at first slightly apart, then would realise that mum kept feeding the birds located in the middle of the doorway. Slowly but surely they would shuffle tight together in the hope that mum would pick them when she flew in with some insects and flies. Mr Ward said the chicks had him in 'hysterics' as they all sat silently waiting for their mother to return before bursting into life when she arrived Despite the 6am start and long wait for the birds to appear at the doorway, Mr Ward said he left the site a 'happy man' knowing he had taken some remarkable photographs 'They looked so cute and very alert to all the small flies going past the doorway and mother flying past regularly. 'Their little heads were bobbing around like puppets on string waiting for a meal. 'They had me in hysterics as they would sit patiently all relaxed with their mouths shut. 'As mum approached they all went crazy. It was like they were all shouting ""me, me"".' 'They flapped their wings and stood up on their legs screaming with their beaks wide open hoping for mum to pop some grub in.' The father-of-three said there were dfficult shots to get as the doorway was shaded and the light was bad. 'On top of that, mum would be in and out with food in less than a second. I was shooting 12 frames per second on my camera to stand any chance of such images. 'In the end I left a happy man knowing I had captured some great shots and memories to cherish forever.'"

The skeletons - including eight human skulls - were found buried in the grounds of the Tombisana High School in Imphal, the capital of India's northeastern Manipur state. They appear to have been buried somewhere between 20 and 40 years ago when the area was used by the police force and later by a commando unit of the Indian army. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT The skeletons - including eight human skulls - were found buried in the grounds of the Tombisana High School in Imphal, the capital India's northeastern Manipur state It was around this time that there were a large number of 'enforced disappearances' of people in the region, believed to have been victims of 'extra-judicial executions' by security forces. The executions of, mainly young, Indians that occurred in Manipur were part of 'shoot to kill' policy aimed at clamping down on the activities of insurgents. Under the Indian Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (Afspa) 1958, security forces have unrestricted and unaccounted power to carry out their operations, once an area is declared disturbed. Even a non-commissioned officer is granted the right to shoot to kill based on mere suspicion that it is necessary to do so in order to 'maintain the public order'. The remains appear to have been buried somewhere between 20 and 40 years ago when the area was used by the police force and later by a commando unit of the Indian army Rights groups have claimed that security forces used the act as a shield while they carried out human rights violations including arbitrary killings, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and enforced disappearances. The Indian Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act  allows soldiers unrestricted and unaccounted power to carry out their operations, once an area is declared 'disturbed'. This gives the army sweeping powers, including the power to shoot to kill in certain situations and to arrest people without warrants. The Act also provides virtual immunity from prosecution by requiring prior permission to prosecute from the Central Government. It has been put into force in parts of northeast India - including Manipur - since 1958. Amnesty says the law has 'facilitated grave human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, rape and torture and other ill treatment'. The Extra Judicial Execution Victim Families Association (EEVFAM) Manipur and the The Families of the Involuntarily Disappeared Association, Manipur (FIDAM) noted that the compound had been used by the 49 Battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for more than 20 years and later by a commando unit. According to the EEVFAM, some 1,528 people were killed in Manipur in extra-judicial executions between May 1979 and May 2012. However, those demanding an investigation into the uncovered remains have said it is unlikely that even if the killers are identified that there will be any action. But there is now huge pressure in the region  to identify the dead bodies with DNA tests on each skull and the remains. It is hoped that this could bring closure to at least some of the families of the hundreds of  people who have gone missing in the state. Manipur has had a long record of insurgency and inter-ethnic violence with various separatist groups including the communists, the People's Liberation Party, the People's Revolutionary Army and the United National Liberation Front. Individual groups have been responsible for armed robberies and attacks on police stations and army bases as part of their campaign to be free of Indian control. In 1980, the central government brought the entire state of Manipur under the AFSPA because the state government claimed that   local police needed the help of the Armed Forces to maintain law and order. There is now huge pressure in the region to identify the dead bodies. It is hoped that this could bring closure to at least some of the families of the hundreds of people who have gone missing in the state Manipur has had a long record of insurgency and inter-ethnic violence with various separatist groups including the communists and others demanding independence"

Peterhansel suffered a puncture 30km from the end of the stage between Copiapo and Antofagasta and saw his overall lead whittled down to seven minutes 36 seconds by Gordon. The American lost out to Roma, from Spain, by just five seconds and is still awaiting his first stage win in the 2012 rally. Defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah, from Qatar, was disrupted by technical problems and had to stop on several occasions. He now trails Peterhansel by over 45 minutes. Pole Krzysztof Hołowczyc is third, 12 seconds behind Gordon and 7 minutes 48 secs behind the leader. Peterhansel is a Dakar legend with three car titles and six on motorbikes, all coming before the grueling endurance event moved to South America in 2009 but he didn't enjoy his best stage on Monday. He told the Dakar Rally's official website: ""I am losing loads of time. I drove quite slowly in the rocky parts because I was scared of punctures. And despite this... I had one 30 km from the finish. It was a bad special, but that is the way it is. ""Gordon started three minutes before us, and 180 kilometres from here we had got to 30 seconds behind him. I think that when he saw us he stepped it up, leaving us in the dust. ""He can win this thing, so it is essential for him to manage this situation as well as he can."" Defending motorcycle champion Marc Coma sealed the 20th stage win of his Dakar Rally career as rival Cyril Despres got stuck in the mud. Stage eight saw Coma, from Spain, snatch the lead from the Frenchman and build a lead of one minute and 26 seconds. Despres spent ten minutes trying to extricate himself from a patch of mud and cut a frustrated figure at the end of the stage. He said: ""There was a torrent of mud between the inspection of the reconnaissance car two days ago and today. Therefore, it did not appear in the road book and I was the first to fall into the trap. ""There was no way I could have avoided it. I am awaiting the organisers' decision: after Ullevalseter, Gonçalves and a few others had gone through, they took a detour, otherwise there would have been 200 vehicles trapped in the mud. ""So I fail to see why I and the others should be the only ones to pay the price. But I do not think we will let this be."""

An unmanned Atlas V rocket carrying the classified device rose from its seaside Florida pad successfully following an aborted launch on Monday that was foiled by a problem with the environmental control system. It is believed to be the second in a series of four spy satellites that are being launched over the next five months for the United States National Reconnaissance Office. Lift off: An unmanned Atlas V rocket carrying the classified device rose from its seaside Florida pad successfully in June 'We have an exciting NASA mission coming up later this year. Just a lot going on between national security payloads, NASA missions, so a great time to watch a rocket launch here at the Cape.' Mystery surrounds the exact type and capabilities of the hardware aboard with some suggesting it will be used to support American soldiers in various warzones around the world Launch: The spacecraft will be carried in an Atlas 5 rocket, like the one seen here A file photo shows the X-37B during encapsulation within the United Launch Alliance Atlas V 5-meter fairing in Titusville. Following an earlier launch the Vice President of United Launch Alliance told the press: 'ULA is proud to have supported this mission and delivered critical capabilities to the men and women defending our freedom throughout the world.' And the firm Pratt & Whitney, which supplied the engine, released a press release saying: 'The reliable RL10 engine continues to serve a vital role ensuring these critical payloads are safely delivered into orbit, providing critical capabilities to our service women and men serving around the world.' According to some intelligence analysts, the satellite contains high-tech weather imaging technology that allows it to effectively see through clouds and bad weather. An NBC report following the first launch speculated: 'The rocket likely has a weather-imaging satellite aboard, according to intelligence analysts. 'The satellite can see through night and through bad weather, which means that it can also zoom in to 'countries of interest' with great detail, like a Google Earth on serious Cold War steroids.' According to a ULA press release, the rocket was developed by the USAF to 'assure access to space for Department of Defense and other government payloads.'"

They emerged as it was revealed Scotland Yard investigated the pervert for molesting a young girl in a mobile home at BBC Television Centre up to 30 years ago. But they failed to act and merely warned him to stay away from children rather than take the chance to arrest him for his sick crimes. Lair: Savile looks relaxed on the bed in a feature on his motor home as more and more allegations of his abuse came out today Black and white: Picture of Saville's Dodge 'Hustler' released on the day a woman accused him of attacking her in his caravan at BBC Television Centre Creepy photographs show the child abuser on his bed, while another shows its inside, where he may have sexually assaulted or raped victims. Its front is emblazoned with the word 'hustler' - the name of the Dodge vehicle. Another, taken for a day in the life documentary, shows inside the caravan and Savile staring at people out of its window. The Jim’ll Fix It star faced questions in the 1980s after the child claimed she was indecently assaulted in his caravan, which he had parked outside the BBC’s headquarters. The allegation came to light after a retired officer from the Met’s juvenile bureau at Hammersmith and Fulham police station came forward. He said there had not been enough evidence to prosecute Savile. It is one of the earliest known full police inquiries into the entertainer and took place at the height of his abuse. It means police missed at least seven chances to expose Savile’s crimes during his lifetime. Watching the world go by: The dead disgraced broadcaster stares out of the window in the feature: 'A day in the life of Jimmy Savile' Modern: The inside of the Dodge 'Hustler' would have been very luxurious at the time, but it is also likely Savile used it to carry out his disgusting sexual abuse Officers in forces including the Met, Surrey and Sussex investigated his activities but the claims were never made public. And it raises fresh questions about what the BBC knew about his sordid activities and whether there was a cover-up. Details of the investigation emerged as the man in charge of Scotland Yard’s investigation said it marks a ‘watershed’ in tackling child abuse. Commander Peter Spindler said 300 people have now claimed to be victims of the TV presenter and others in his circle, while the size of the team responsible for the investigation has been trebled to 30. Paedophile: Jimmy Savile, pictured a few days before his death in October last year The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Agency has been asked to examine whether anyone named by victims is still working with children. These could include BBC staff and even doctors from some of the hospitals where Savile abused patients under the guise of charity. Mr Spindler said: ‘While Britain reflects on how Savile was able to hide in plain sight, I think it’s quite important that we focus on what’s happening today in our society. 'Our activities in the coming weeks will be a stark warning to any men out there today who think they can exploit their positions of power and influence and abuse children and young people in Britain. ‘I want them to take heed and tell them that we will  come for them. You may  believe you will get away with your crimes. 'But one day – it might not be this decade – we will come and get justice for those victims. Victims may not want to speak straight away, but when they are ready, we will be listening.’ Scotland Yard’s inquiry, Operation Yewtree, is moving into a new and more secretive phase as detectives prepare to arrest surviving suspects. The Met has also discovered a second complaint made in 2003 by a woman who said she had been abused in the 1970s, he revealed. Mr Spindler added: ‘She did not want a prosecution but wanted us to know what happened in case there was a pattern of offending.’ Allegation: Savile faced questions in the 1980s after a girl claimed she was sexually assaulted in his caravan, which he had parked outside the BBC's headquarters (above) VIDEO: Jimmy Savile denies allegations in an interview - SIX years ago..."

Facebook, or ""FB"" as it's now known to investors, may have made amateur analysts on the Web go wild. But on the Nasdaq, it was a less exciting ride -- ending the day at a price pretty much exactly where it began. Friends may be priceless. But 'friending' both started and ended the day at just over $38 a share. Facebook's was the biggest opening ever for a tech company and the third-largest IPO in U.S. history, behind only Visa and General Motors. On the Web, reactions ran the gamut from deliriously hopeful to harshly negative for the social-media giant's Wall Street potential. ""A $104 billion market capitalization puts Facebook at more than 100 times its trailing earnings,"" wrote John Constine and Kim-Mai Cutler for technology blog TechCrunch. ""That's a big multiple to live up to, and it will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation."" And it wasn't just the pros weighing in. In fact, it seemed like everyone on the Internet had an opinion. Business Insider posted a poll (obviously not scientific) asking readers where they thought the $38 stock would be by the end of the day Friday. Early Friday, a pessimistic 15% said under $35. But the biggest cluster of respondents had guessed somewhere between $40 and 55. (15% said $40 to 45, another 13% said $45 to 50 and, yes, yet another 12% said $50-55). A hopeful 10% predicted the stock would skyrocket at otherworldly levels, winding up over $90 a share. Facebook's new billionaires Results were similar on another site that sprung up, Facebook IPO Day Closing Price. Its graph showed the biggest number of predictions clustering around what ultimately would be an overly optimistic $50 mark. On rival network Twitter, many observers seemed to be rooting against Facebook and its early investors, finding a measure of glee in the fact that the price didn't skyrocket as some had predicted. ""Facebook stock has already started to tank,"" wrote user Jen Misty (yes, with a healthy dose of hyperbole). ""In my best Nelson voice from Simpsons -- ""HA! HA!"" There was this swipe at youthful startup culture from tweeter Ross Heart: ""Harder? Keeping $FB over 38 or trying to get hired at Facebook being over 38?"" And then there was this sports metaphor, which referenced a certain polarizing NBA star. ""Rooting against Facebook stock price > [is greater than] rooting against LeBron,"" wrote a user named Jay Kang. More sober-minded watchers, however, noted that on Wall Street, when an opening stock sticks close to where it started, it means it was probably priced correctly to begin with. ""Few hours into trading and Facebook's stocks maintain a $40 value,"" wrote Giuseppe D'Antonio. ""No drop, no frenzy behaviour, no wild fluctuations. Serious matter!"" While opinions in the business and tech communities have differed on whether the massive social network is a good investment, analysts have largely been bullish on the stock. There's been heavy demand, leading Facebook on Wednesday to announce it will sell about 25% more shares than it had originally planned, bringing its total to 421 million shares. At CNN content partner Mashable, a blog that got its start focusing exclusively on social media and saw its popularity rise as Facebook's did, the staff geared up by creating an IPO-inspired playlist on music site Spotify (which, perhaps not coincidentally, is accessible only through a Facebook account). Making the list? ""Mo Money, Mo Problems,"" by The Notorious B.I.G., ""Rich"" by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,"" ""Money (That's What I Want) by Barrett Strong and ""If I Had $1,000,000"" by Barenaked Ladies, among others.

""Things definitely went my way out here tonight, but I have had a lot tougher matches in the last one-and-a-half years, so this is nice to get a lucky break again."" Federer notched up a solitary title in 2013, beating Mikhail Youzhny on the grass of Halle last June as the 32-year-old struggled with a back injury. But after hiring Stefan Edberg as a part-time coach at the end of last year (he wasn't present in Dubai), Federer has enjoyed a promising start to 2014, reaching the finals of the Brisbane International and the semis of the Australian Open in January. The 17-time Grand Slam champion led the Czech 11-6 in head-to-heads going into Saturday's match, but Berdych had prevailed in their last two encounters, which including a three-set win at the semifinal stage in Dubai last year. It was the big Czech who took an early lead, breaking in the sixth game before taking the opening set without alarm. Another break of serve in the fifth game of the second set and Berdych looked odds on for back-to-back titles after winning in Rotterdam last month. But Federer made the most of some unforced errors by the Czech in the next game to level and then broke himself in the 10th to level the match. After saving a break of serve in the opening game of the third, Federer then made a crucial break in the fourth game before clinching victory and ending Berdych's 11-match winning streak. Federer's win sees him claim third place outright on the list of all-time ATP Tour winners list, although it seems he is unlikely to go any higher. In second place is Ivan Lendl with 94 wins with Jimmy Connors way out in front on 109.

The Argentina forward, who headed off clubmates Andres Iniesta and Xavi to win the FIFA Ballon d'Or on Monday, proved the difference after the visitors provided stern early resistance. The 23-year-old finally broke the deadlock a minute before halftime with a delightful chip, and the tie was effectively over ahead of next week's second leg when he completed his treble with 17 minutes to play. Betis deserved better for their first-half efforts, highlighted by Ruben Castro crashing a shot against the crossbar soon after Messi's opener. Why were EPL players snubbed in all-star selection? But in the end they had goalkeeper Casto to thank that the scoreline was not even greater as he bravely thwarted a succession of Barca attacks. As it was, Pedro made it 4-0 on 76 with his 13th goal in 14 games after Casto blocked Daniel Alves' initial effort, and Seydou Keita headed the fifth with seven minutes to play as he rose high to meet Iniesta's outrageous scooped cross. Midfielder Iniesta also had an assist with Messi's first, while the second came in the 62nd minute following a pass from David Villa as the diminutive hero of the Catalan crowd squeezed home from an acute angle after Casto beat out his first attempt. Messi took his tally to 31 for the season when he won a one-on-one duel with the keeper, but Casto denied him a fourth from a similar situation before he was substituted.

The Cameroon star struck in the 15th minute and again just before halftime with a fierce half-volley for his 21st this season, but Genoa midfielder Houssine Kharja reduced the deficit nine minutes after the break with a penalty following a foul by debutant defender Andrea Ranocchia -- playing against his former club. Kenyan midfielder MacDonald Mariga restored Inter's two-goal advantage with a header from a corner five minutes later, and Giuseppe Sculli's reply in time added on was just a consolation.

The appeal was originally scheduled to begin next week but was delayed indefinitely because of the change of lawyers, Nahrath said. Nahrath would not say when he was hired and would not comment on his political affiliations. He did not say he had been fired and did not respond to CNN requests for comment about the matter Thursday. The German Interior Ministry said Nahrath was the leader of the far-right Wiking Jugend until authorities banned the group in 1994. Williamson was in Germany, where Holocaust denial is a crime, when he made the remarks in an interview with Swedish television. The comments came shortly before Pope Benedict XVI lifted an excommunication on him and three other ultraconservative bishops. The Vatican said Benedict was not aware of Williamson's views on the Holocaust when the excommunication was lifted, and the pope ordered Williamson to recant. The excommunication was not related to his Holocaust denial. Williamson was convicted of Holocaust denial in April. He did not appear in court to fight the charges. Nahrath's father and grandfather led the Wiking Jugend before he did, according to the anti-extremist group Netz-gegen-Nazis. It said the Wiking Jugend was an imitation of the Hitler Youth, a group set up by Hitler to teach Nazi principles to children. Williamson's order, the ultra-conservative Society of St. Pius X, distanced itself from his decision to hire Nahrath. The order's superior general, Bishop Bernard Fellay, threatened to expel Williamson from the society if he stuck with his lawyer."

Michael Obi, who runs a transport company, had not been seen or heard from since he failed to return home from work in Jos, the capital of Plateau State in central Nigeria, on August 12. But Nigerian police said detectives traced the kidnappers to Kano, a sprawling city in northern Nigeria around 180 miles away from where he was snatched, and arrested the people responsible. Safe: Michael Obi, the kidnapped father of Chelsea footballer John Obi Mikel, has been rescued by police in Nigeria after being missing for 10 days Captors: The alleged kidnappers were paraded by Kano state police shortly after they were arrested in a police raid on the house where they held him In the pictures released by Nigerian police Michael looks disheveled, tired and drawn, with his pink shirt torn at the lapel, but he is now safe. He took part in a hastily-arranged news conference on Monday night at a police station in Kano, where six of his suspected kidnappers were paraded. 'I was taken right deep into the bush, in an isolated area in Jos,' said Michael in a brief statement to journalists. 'I started begging them, yet they beat me mercilessly, kicking me with their boot. They are five of them and they were dressed in military uniforms. 'They pushed me into a vehicle painted in military (colors) and began to drive very fast. I never knew a vehicle can fly like that.' Police said they had launched an investigation to see if the accused were soldiers, though authorities believe the kidnappers used military-style camouflage fatigues to abduct Michael and remain unchallenged in a country still wary of the military after a string of dictatorships. Chelsea star: Mikel, front right, continued to play for his club throughout the ordeal and was on duty against West Bromwich Albionon Saturday 'They beat me mercilessly': Michael Obi said his captors mistreated him during the kidnap, in which they wore military uniforms Kano state police commissioner Ibrahim Idris identified the kidnappers as five men, including a former police officer, and a woman. The accused did not immediately have a lawyer and remained largely silent as police showed them to journalists. London-based Sport Entertainment and Media Group, the management company for John Obi Mikel, welcomed his father's release. Mikel's management company SEM released a statement this evening confirming that the Nigerian international's father had been released. 'Earlier today Michael Obi called his family to advise them that he had been released by his abductors,' the statement read. '(We) have waited until now to release this information, to ensure that Michael was safe. Success: A Nigerian police officer stands guard over Michael Obi, while his son John Obi Mikel has continued to perform for Chelsea despite the family ordeal 'John Obi Mikel would like to thank everyone in Nigeria, his family & friends, Chelsea FC & their fans & his agents for their total support during this terrible time.' The statement does not reveal whether a ransom was paid. Michael Obi is reported to have told the BBC shortly after his release: 'I am very stressed.' Mikel continued to play for Chelsea during his father's disappearance, appearing in the Blues' Barclays Premier League opener at Stoke before their home 2-1 win over West Brom on Saturday. Chelsea released a statement tonight offering their support for Mikel's family. 'All at Chelsea Football Club are delighted that John Mikel Obi's father, Michael, has been found safe in Nigeria,' the statement read. Violence: Jos, which is in the Plateau state, has seen thousands die in recent years in religious and ethnic violence rooted largely on political and economic issues Relief: Left, Chelsea star John Mikel Obi, who played on throughout the ordeal, with his agent John Shittu 'Mikel has shown outstanding commitment and professionalism during this most difficult of times, and the club will continue to offer its full support to him and his family.' Michael Obi was kidnapped on August 12 while on his way home from work in the central Nigerian city of Jos. Nigeria, an oil-rich country of 150 million people, is almost evenly split between Muslims in the north and the predominantly Christian south. Businessman: Michael Obi runs a transport firm in Nigeria and he was grabbed on his way home from work Plateau state, in Nigeria's fertile central belt, has seen thousands die in recent years in religious and ethnic violence rooted largely in political and economic issues. Mikel's family, from the Igbo tribe, is in the minority in the Plateau State. However, the footballer said the kidnapping shocked him because his family never had any problems there before. Kidnappings in Plateau state are a rarity when compared to Nigeria's oil-producing southern delta, where militants and criminal gangs often kidnap foreigners for ransom. Middle class Nigerian families also increasingly find themselves targeted in the country's East as well. It isn't the first time a football player's family has been targeted in Nigeria. In 2008, gunmen abducted the younger brother of Everton defender Joseph Yobo as he left a nightclub in Port Harcourt, the delta's largest city. The brother was released unharmed about two weeks later, though it was unclear if a ransom had been paid. Most kidnap victims find themselves released only after their loved ones pay ransom. A Forbes magazine survey in June listed Mikel as the seventh highest-paid African player in Europe. The magazine listed Mikel's salary as around £3.5million a year."

Mark Pryor has privately told gay rights activists he supports a redefinition of marriage to include gay and lesbians unions. Pryor, who is in a tight reelection battle, has publicly maintained an anti-gay-marriage stance in the red state in order to stay electable. 'I support traditional marriage, and I've been pretty clear on that for a long time,' Sen. Mark Pryor said in a May 31 news broadcast on KHBS-TV40 in the city of Fort Smith. But one of the state's prominent gay rights leaders told an undercover investigator with Project Veritas Action, a conservative group known for its 'gotcha' videos, that Pryor has assured gay marriage advocates he's on their side. 'If you tell anyone I told you that, I'm gonna find you, and I'll kill you,' the activist, Bailey Rae Bibb, says in the video after confiding in the hidden camera-wearing covert operative. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO Bailey Bibb, who chairs the largest Young Democrats gay caucus group in Arkansas, said on a hidden camera that Sen. Mark Pryor has assured her he supports marriage equality for gays and lesbians Bibb made it clear that she was telling the investigator, posing as the partner of a wealthy potential donor, something that wasn't common knowledge NOT SO FAST: Pryor told an Arkansas TV news audience in May that ' I support traditional marriage, and I've been pretty clear on that for a long time' Bibb leads the Stonewall Caucus of the Young Democrats of Arkansas. She spoke to a man posing as a gay man who said his wealthy partner was considering making a large donation to support Pryor's reelection effort. 'I'm having some misgivings about it, given his marriage stance,' he tells her. Bibb replies while Pryor is 'not going to openly come out and say, ""Oh yeah, I support it"",'he changes his position 'if you ask him personally, just people-to-people.' Asked if she has personally had that conversation with the senator, Bibb explains, 'Oh, yeah,' adding that Pryor had told her 'I'm not against' gay marriage equality and that he is 'not going to outlaw it.' 'He said to a small group, like, ""Hey, you know, I’m not going to try to outlaw it, you know. I don’t think you should be discriminated against"",' Bibb says on camera. 'No, he’s not a bad person.' Bibb did not respond to phone, Facebook, SMS text and messages seeking comment. The Pryor campaign did not immediately respond to a request for clarification about the senator's position on gay marriage. Pryor's main opponent, Republican Rep. Tom Cotton, has not wavered from his anti-gay-marriage position. 'I believe that marriage is between one man and one woman,' he told KHBS in May. Cotton holds a 4.4 percentage-point lead in an average of recent polls, according to Real Clear Politics. Pryor's seat could be one of six the Republican Party needs to flip in order to cement control over both houses of Congress. Pryor is one of only a few Democratic senators – Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu and West Viginia Sen. Joe Manchin are the others – who publicly oppose a wave of state laws validating the right of gays and lesbians to legally marry. In red states, openly embracing a politically progressive position like marriage rights for gays and lesbians can spell doom for a Democratic candidate if Republicans make it the centerpiece of attack ads. Democratic Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe has also said publicly that he opposes gay marriage. Pryor spokesman Michael Teague told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette last year that the senator had a 'moral belief that marriage is between a man and a woman,' and believed that homosexuality is a choice and not an inborn trait of biology. Those positions are now ripe for speculation in the light of Wednesday's video exposé. Bibb, the Democratic activist, confirmed in a follow-up phone call what Pryor had said privately Pryor (right) and his main opponent, Republican Rep. Tom Cotton (left) debated Monday night, but the gay marriage issue wasn't raised Project Veritas Action founder James O'Keefe told MailOnline that in Arkansas, 'key workers, donors, supporters and elected officials have an expectation that their Democratic Senate candidates are lying in order to gain votes and it doesn't bother them one bit.' 'We are talking about a casual disregard for the truth from the grassroots all the way to the top.' His video includes a second admission from Paragould, Arkansas Mayor Mike Gaskill, that 'the sad thing about politics' in his home state is that 'people can't stand up and say what they really, really want to do and believe in.' O'Keefe is known for his take-no-prisoners sneak attacks and over-the-top video dramatizations. In one video this year, he staged a U.S. border infiltration by a man dressed in an Osama bin Laden costume, rolling video as the man waded across the Rio Grande from Mexico. In another he demonstrated how an Ebola-infected jihadi from the ISIS terror army could motorboat across Lake Erie from Canada without a challenge, and stroll into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. But it's his political hit pieces that generate the most media attention. In 2013 his operatives filmed wireless phone company employees passing out 'Obama phones,' free mobile phones paid for with U.S. tax dollars, to people who said they would sell them for drugs, shoes, handbags and spending cash. Last week O'Keefe released a surreptitiously made video showing supporters and staffers of Kentucky Democratic Senate hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes saying that she was playing a 'lying game' by publicly supporting her state's coal industry. 'You know she has to say that,' one campaign staffer says on tape, 'because in Kentucky if you don’t support the coal industry you are dead.' Bailey Rae Bibb, chair of the Young Democrats of Arkansas Stonewall Caucus, is chummy with Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe – another red-state Democrat who says publicly that he opposes marriage rights for gays PRIDE: The Stonewall Caucus is a politically active gay and lesbian group within Young Democrats for Arkansas, and its energetic liberal campaigners have the ear of progressive pols throughout the state Gay rights has had a pendulum-like trajectory in Arkansas, one that provides hints to Sen. Pryor's leanings. Sodomy was illegal in Arkansas between its 1836 founding and the passage of a 1976 law decriminalizing it. One year later Pryor's father, then-Governor David Pryor, signed a second bill once again making the practice illegal, following a widely publicized case of two men engaging in oral sex in a Pulaski County, Arkansas 'drunk tank' holding cell. That law stood until 2002 when the Arkansas Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional. It was Sen. Pryor, then the state's attorney general, who made the decision to let the ruling stand and not appeal it to the U.S. Supreme Court. But he later conceded that in 2004 he voted against a statewide ballot initiative banning gay marriage. That measure passed, but was overturned in May 2014 by a state circuit judge. 'My position on that specifically is well-documented,' he said in video footage released days later by the conservative America Rising PAC, an opposition research group. 'That was a ballot initiative here in Arkansas ... I voted for the amendment to ban gay marriage in Arkansas.' As a senator, his recent record on gay rights has been a continuing study in U-turns. In 2010 Pryor stunned Arkansans with a flip-flop on the repeal of the Pentagon's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy, a Bill Clinton-era directive that banned gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military. 'On many previous occasions, I have said that I would oppose repeal,' he conceded, announcing his change of heart. Pryor is the latest in a long string of left-leaning US political candidates stung by hard-charging conservative video provocateur James O'Keefe Mike Gaskill, Democratic mayor of the northeast Arkansas town of Paragould, told O'Keefe's undercover cameraman that politicians often can't be candid about their beliefs when votes are on the line But a 2012 Senate bill proposing to ban discrimination against gays in federal workplaces has yet to receive his endorsement, despite co-sponsorships from all 52 of his fellow Senate Democrats, plus two Republicans and both independents. During the 2009-2010 congressional session, according to Project Vote Smart, Pryor enjoyed an 80 per cent positive rating from the Human Rights Campaign, America's most vocal gay rights policy group. Two years later his rating fell to 70 per cent. This year, as his electoral deadline approached, that rating stands at 60 per cent. If Bailey Bibb, the Young Democrats of Arkansas activist, is right, Pryor may soon swing back toward full agreement. 'If Baily Bibb is telling the truth, then Mark Pryor is lying,' O'Keefe says in his video. But for now, with Election Day less than three weeks away, the endangered Arkansas senator is sticking to his guns."

But she still has that eternal edge-of-17 tremor in her voice. The gypsy queen is in royal form on ""In Your Dreams"" -- it's not just her first album in 10 years, it's her finest collection of songs since the Eighties. ""In Your Dreams"" has the high-gloss L.A. production of her collaborators, Glen Ballard and Eurythmics' Dave Stewart. But the material is Nicks in platform-soled hyper-romantic mode, with her voice in surprisingly supple shape. ""Secret Love"" is an oldie she wrote in 1976 -- who knew she was still keeping secrets from her ""Rumours"" days? It seems to be about one of her rock-star beaus, although she coyly maintains she can't remember which one. Yet it isn't even one of the better tracks on ""In Your Dreams."" The over-the-top seduction ballad ""Italian Summer"" could be her answer to the Stones' ""Wild Horses."" It climaxes in a very Stevie credo: ""Love was everywhere/You just had to fall."" Nicks finds storytelling inspiration everywhere, from the Twilight series (""Moonlight [A Vampire's Dream]"") to Jean Rhys (""Wide Sargasso Sea""). But the real showstopper here is the Edgar Allan Poe tribute ""Annabel Lee,"" a fan fave that's been kicking around on bootlegs since the Nineties. It's a six-minute meditation on love and death with echoes of the Fleetwood Mac classic ""Dreams."" Poe's key line -- ""The moon never beams without bringing me dreams""  -- might have been written in 1849, but it was clearly meant for Stevie Nicks to sing.

Mexican families swim and wash cars along the banks of the Rio Grande at the U.S. border in Juarez in June. The Border Patrol captured 695,841 people nationwide in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007, down from 907,445 for the same period the previous fiscal year, or a 23 percent drop, said Border Patrol spokesman Michael Friel. Arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border declined by 24 percent, he said. Border Patrol officials said the reasons for the change are varied and complex, but Friel said, ""We're clearly seeing a deterrent."" One factor cited by officials is the end of the practice of releasing non-Mexican immigrants, pending court hearings. The Border Patrol captured  50,349 non-Mexican illegal immigrants nationwide in the nine-month period ending June 30, down from 89,952 during the same period of fiscal 2006. That's a 44 percent decrease. The decrease was 48 percent for non-Mexican illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border. Other factors include the 6,000 National Guard troops patrolling along the Southwest border, more detention space and enhanced enforcement in the interior, Friel said. Outside economic, political and social factors also are ""always involved"" in fluctuating levels of immigrants seeking entry into the United States, he said. Last month, opponents effectively killed President Bush's long-fought and emotion-laden immigration bill in the Senate when members voted against advancing the legislation. The bill aimed to create a path to citizenship for some of the 12 million illegal immigrants and to toughen border security. Supporters and opponents of the legislation said that it probably won't be resurrected until the 2008 elections are over. E-mail to a friend CNN's Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report."

Detectives say Diego Duran and his family were sitting outside their home in Ruskin, Florida watching fireworks, reports ABC Action News. Suddenly at around 1am, the young boy's mother Sandra saw him fall to the ground bleeding from the eyes and the nose. Scroll down for video Victim: Diego Duran, 12, was shot in the head by a stray bullet during New Year's celebrations. He remains in critical condition at hospital in Ruskin, Florida Diego's father, also named Diego,told cfnews13.com that his son just dropped. 'All of a sudden, hell breaks loose - blood all over the place.' He was rushed to hospital, where doctors realised that he was suffering from a gun shot wound and the bullet had entered the top of his head and was lodged in his cheek. The boy is in a coma, but did squeeze a nurse's hand and also opened his eyes, his family said. Although his son remains in a critical condition, Mr Duran told cfnews13.com that he was not giving up. Tragic: Diego was watching fireworks outside his home when he fell to the ground Worry: Diego's father, also named Diego, said his son 'ain't going to give up' He said: 'He’s one of the best men somebody’s ever going to meet when he grows up. 'He’s a man in the making. Somebody just put a stop on him, but he ain’t going give up. He’s going to grow up and be a better man than what I am.' More people are injured or killed each year by falling bullets than many would believe. From 1985 to 1992, 118 victims of gunshot wounds in the Los Angeles area alone were thought to have been struck by them. These included people hit by bullets while going about their everyday business. The chance of being killed by a falling bullet is much higher than a typical shooting - because those unlucky enough to be hit by falling shells are more likely to be struck on the head. And while bullets are travelling slower after being shot into the sky, they are still capable of smashing skulls. Doctors say a spent bullet falls back to Earth with a speed of between 90 and 180 metres per second. A bullet travelling at less than 60 metres per second can cause a fatal skull injury. Detectives believe the boy was hit by celebratory gunfire falling from the sky after it was fired from a distance that could have been miles away. Sheriff's office spokesman Larry McKinnon said the boy is in a hospital in Tampa in a critical condition with the bullet still lodged. 'It is a crime,' he told 10 News. 'It was an irresponsible act and if we find out who did that the consequences are going to be some very serious charges.' Investigating detectives found that no one nearby had been firing a gun. The incident follows the death in December of a teenage Amish girl who police said died in a 'freak accident' after a hunter fired his gun into the air a mile away. Rachel Yoder, 15, from Ohio, was shot in the head when she was riding her horse and cart back from a Christmas party. At first it was thought she died as a result of falling from her buggy after her brother found her in a pool of blood. But when she got to the hospital they found a bullet lodged in her head. Holmes County Sheriff Timothy Zimmerly told ABC News the man said he was preparing to clean his muzzle-loaded rifle after deer hunting and fired it into the air. Sheriff Zimmerly said the bullet from his rifle 'is consistent with' the one that struck the girl riding in a buggy more than a mile away.

But the same time retired households on middle incomes saw their income rise by more than £900, despite the turmoil on the stock markets triggered by the global banking crisis. The Office for National Statistics said private pensions increased markedly from 2007 onwards, while those in work saw wage cuts or freezes. Since the financial crash in 2007-08,m incomes of working households (green line) has fallen, while the incomes of retired households (purple line) has risen) The Office for National Statistics said payouts from private pensions have risen markedly, driving up incomes (at 2011-12 prices) New analysis shows how the so-called ‘median household income’ of average families rises and falls in line with the prospects of the wider economy. Households saw incomes rise as the economy grew, but fell after the recessions of the early 1980s, early 1990s and late 2000s. Between 2007-08 when before the financial crisis and latest figures for 2011-12, the median income for working households fell by 6.4 per cent from £27,053 to £25,671 at 2011-12 prices. However the median income for retired households grew by 5.1 per cent over the same period, to £19,253 in 2011-12. Average direct taxes paid by the middle fifth of non-retired households have fallen from £8,700 in 2007-08 to £6,800 in 2011-12 The ONS said: ‘The largest driver of this increase was income from private pensions, which grew by 22 per cent. ‘This was partly due to more recently retired people receiving higher incomes from private pensions, on average. ‘The other source of growth over this period was the State Pension which grew by 9 per cent for the middle fifth of retired households.’ All households have seen incomes rise in real terms in the last three decades. In 1977 the average household income was the equivalent of £11,200 in today’s prices, compared to £23,200 in 2011-12. The median household income grew by 2.2 per cent on average every year. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use his Autumn Statement on Thursday to ease the pressure on squeezed family finances. He is under pressure from some Tories including former Defence Secretary Liam Fox to offer tax cuts, to allow people to keep more of the money they earn. But Mr Osborne has played down the prospect of significant tax cuts or extra spending commitments as he promised to deliver a 'responsible recovery'. Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to use this week's Autumn Statement to ease the strain on family finances Labour's shadow treasury minister Catherine McKinnell said: 'These figures show that disposable incomes for the average working-age household fell by over £1,500 a year in David Cameron’s first two years in Downing Street. 'And after three damaging years of flatlining the cost-of-living crisis under this Government continues as prices are still rising much faster than wages. 'That’s why we need action in the Autumn Statement to tackle the rising cost of living and ensure we can earn our way to higher living standards for all and not just a few at the top. 'But with energy bills still rising this winter after the Government’s announcements, David Cameron and George Osborne look set to fail the test.'"

An 11-year-old offender was apprehended in the Thames Valley area in 2011 while ‘numerous’ 12-year-olds were stopped in Scotland in 2012 and in Manchester in 2008, say police chiefs. More widely, an average of 1,000 people per year aged under the age of 18 have been convicted of drink-driving since 2008, according to the police figures obtained by in-car camera provider Nextbase under Freedom of Information laws. Under the influence: Children as young as 11 have been caught drink driving (picture posed by model) More than a quarter (26 per cent) of drink drivers under 18 were 16 or younger, meaning they were not of the legal age to drive. The statistics showed there were an average of five drink drivers under 18 caught each week since 2008. The worrying statistics are based on responses from 43 police forces following Freedom of Information Act requests. The figures covered the number of under-18 drink-drivers caught in the six years from 2008 to 2013. They reveal that every one of the 43 forces had apprehended under-18 drink-drivers during the six years covered. The figures showed that the worst English region for underage drink-driving in this period was Greater Manchester, where 409 under-18s were arrested. Other hotspots included Scotland, with 718 drink-drive offenders from 2008 to 2013, Hampshire (276 offenders), Devon and Cornwall (241) and Sussex (160). Nextbase said the total number of underage drink driving incidents had fallen year-on-year, but a number of police areas had seen an increase from 2012 to 2013. Toll: The statistics showed there were an average of five drink drivers under 18 caught each week since 2008 These included South Yorkshire (where a number of 14, 15 and 16-year-olds were caught in 2013), Northumbria, Thames Valley, Kent, North Yorkshire, West Mercia, Staffordshire, South Wales, Cheshire and Cambridgeshire. Merseyside, Devon and Cornwall saw the greatest fall in offending individuals between 2012 and 2013. A spokesman from one of the police force's Freedom of Information offices said the nature of drink driving convictions in under-18s is such that they will often be found in conjunction with other convictions. The cluster of offences committed by underage drink drivers may include unlawful possession of a vehicle, driving without a licence, driving without insurance and illegal purchase of alcohol, as well as driving in excess of the legal limit.

Motorists have to be aware of such threats and take appropriate measures to mitigate the risk.’"

The device intercepted in Flagstaff late Thursday was in a package addressed to Arpaio at his downtown Phoenix office, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. It appeared suspicious, so it was X-rayed and the device was detected. A bomb squad team neutralized the explosive, the statement said. Scroll down for video Law officers in Arizona have intercepted an explosive device that was earmarked for Arizona Sherriff Joe Arpaio Postal Inspector Patricia Armstrong said investigators were examining debris from the package. 'We don't know if it was an actual device of some sort,' she said. Armstrong said authorities were alerted by a 'very astute' carrier who observed 'something suspicious' about the package when the carrier emptied a collection box in the Flagstaff area. Flagstaff is about 140 miles north of Phoenix. Armstrong didn't elaborate, but Tom Mangan, a spokesman in Phoenix for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said initial reports indicated that the package was a box that may have been damaged in transit and leaked gunpowder. Arpaio said the mailing of an explosive device addressed to him comes with his line of work. He cited the recent killings of a West Virginia sheriff, Colorado's corrections director and two prosecutors in Texas. 'That's the nature of the business,' he said. 'I'm getting many threats. This isn't the first time.' Intercepted: The device intercepted in Flagstaff late Thursday was in a package addressed to Arpaio at his downtown Phoenix office, Following the killing of a West Virginia sheriff last week, Arpaio said elected law enforcement officials across the nation seem to be targeted. Numerous threats against Arpaio, a hero to many conservatives on immigration, prompted the need for a security detail for the lawman also known for dressing jail inmates in pink underwear and making them sleep in tents in the heat of the Arizona desert. A campaign to recall Arpaio began just weeks after he started his sixth term in January. Critics contend Arpaio should be ousted because his office failed to adequately investigate more than 400 sex-crimes cases, allegedly racially profiled Latinos in its trademark immigration patrols and has cost the county $25 million in legal settlements over treatment in county jails. Arpaio has denied that his deputies racially profiled Latinos in traffic patrols targeting illegal immigration. His office has moved to clear up the sex-crime cases and moved to prevent the problem from happening again, he said."

Lieutenant Mark Evison’s mother gave permission for the deeply upsetting images, recorded on the helmet camera of one of his soldiers, to be shown as part of BBC Three’s Our War series. Killed in action: Lieutenant Mark Evison, 26, from the 1st Battalion, The Welsh Guards The 26-year-old, who served with the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, was fatally wounded during a patrol when more than 50 armed Taliban fighters surrounded his men in a 360-degree ambush. The terrifying drama and chaos of the battle is seen in graphic detail. The film shows the exhausted 7 Platoon soldiers carrying Lt Evison back to their base – a mud-walled fort - as insurgents’ bullets whistle around them. Realising time was slipping away, Gunner Steven Gadsby, then 24, lifted ‘the boss’ onto his shoulders and dashed across an exposed bridge to the safety of the base. He was later awarded a Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for bravery. As Lt Evison lays bleeding on the battlefield, he can be heard telling his men: ‘I’m going down… I’m going down.’ Desperately fighting to keep him alive, the guardsmen reply: ‘No you’re not, sir… Stay with us, sir… Stay f****** with us.’ Their anger and increasing frustration can be heard as they struggle to get a signal on their poorly- functioning Bowman radios. The communications breakdown meant a helicopter to evacuate the severely injured officer was delayed by more than an hour. Traumatised troops describe how a better radio with a stronger signal could not be used because they did not have vital spare parts to repair the equipment in the fort, Haji Alem, in a Taliban stronghold. Scroll down for video The BBC documentary paints a clear picture of how soldiers live on the front line Controversial footage that includes Lt Evison's dying moments is due to be shown in BBC 3's 'Our War' Lt Evison's mother allowed the BBC to use footage from a fellow soldier's helmet camera Hauntingly, Lt Evison foretold of the potentially-lethal consequences of kit shortages in a diary entry 18 days before his death. ‘I have a lack of radios, water, food and medical equipment,’ he wrote. ‘Injuries will be sustained which I will not be able to treat, and deaths could occur which could have been stopped. We are walking on a tightrope.’ A bullet had severed an artery in Lt Evison’s right shoulder on May 9, 2009. He was flown to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham but he was brain dead. His life support system was turned off on May 12. His commanding officer said Lt Evison was ‘one of the finest young officers of his generation’. His mother, Margaret Evison, 66, from Dulwich, south London, said today why she allowed the extraordinary footage to be shown. Mother Margaret Evison hopes the footage will raise awareness of equipment issues within the army Margaret Evison, (in green), watches as her son's coffin is carried out of the Guards Chapel, London, following his funeral service She was given it in April 2010 by the military authorities as they prepared for her son’s inquest. Mrs Evison, a clinical psychologist, said: ‘Programmes like Our War are important even if I find them very upsetting. They show the grittiness, the hands-on aspects of the war, exactly what is going on. There is still very hard fighting in Afghanistan.’ ‘I hope the public will get a sense of how humane the soldiers are. Of how decent they are. ‘I hope people will see what the soldiers are up against – out there, fighting. ‘I want any claims the Army might have for proper equipment to be supported. The more awareness the better. Every tiny bit helps.’ Describing the first time she saw the images, she said: ‘The footage somehow seemed more horrible than anything I had imagined. That patrol base just seemed more brutish… alien. ‘His platoon watched it together. They were relieved because they could see that they had done everything right – that their contribution had been almost textbook stuff.’ Mrs Evison will watch the whole programme, called The Lost Platoon, when it is aired on Monday. Lt Evison was a physically fit young man with a bright future ahead of him Lt Evison shown puffing on what may have been a victory cigar She said: ‘I will see it. I will force myself to see it. No, that is not incredible strength. It is just doing one’s job, what Mark would have wanted. ‘He wouldn’t have wanted me to do nothing else with my life. He would have wanted me to get on with it. ‘So I must deal with these things. And psychologists believe that the best way to deal with trauma is to deal with it – not sweep it under the carpet. ‘I stay in touch with other mother’s who have lost sons. We are all the same when it happens, all just as mad. ‘Your head knows what has happened, but your heart says he is still there, that he has just gone abroad on holiday; that when the doorbell rings, it’s him.’ Mrs Evison, who has set up the Mark Evison Foundation, offering grants to help young people develop through facing challenging activities, has become close to the soldiers of 7 Platoon. Lt Evison's diary reveals the shocking equipment issues facing the British Army She said: ‘I have become very fond of them. When they got back from Afghanistan, they rang me up, one by one, to talk about it. ‘There has always been an understanding: Mark’s death rests heavy on them, and it rests heavy on me. ‘There has always been that shared something, the sharing of pain. ‘I have no doubt that the soldiers loved Mark, just as Mark loved the soldiers. That is a huge comfort.’ She is also unhappy with the kit shortages suffered by British troops. Mrs Evison said: ‘At the time of Mark’s death, there was bureaucratic waste, while the soldiers in the field didn’t seem to have the basic kit they needed.’ Asked whether her son’s death was ‘worth it’, Mrs Evison said: ‘I don’t know yet. That will only become clearer over the years, when we can see the fuller picture. ‘It would be lovely for me and all mother who have lost sons to see the benefit. But in war, it can’t always work out that way.’ * Our War is on BBC Three tonight (Monday) at 9pm Watch the trailer here"

Four years ago, three out of every five Iowans who attended a GOP precinct caucus described themselves that way, and they handed Baptist minister and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee an upset victory over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum would like to repeat that trick again on Tuesday. Whether 60% of the 2012 Iowa GOP caucus vote will be made up of self-described born-again or evangelical voters again, and whether any one of those candidates will be able to scoop up almost half of them as as Huckabee did, remains to be seen. But even if Bachmann, Perry or Santorum can repeat Huckabee's feat, then what? New Hampshire's Yankee Republicans have been notoriously skeptical of what they perceive as holy rollers roaring out of Iowa. Huckabee could only manage a distant third-place finish with 11% of the vote in the 2008 Granite State primary. And when the 1988 Iowa caucuses elevated televangelist Pat Robertson with a second-place finish that year, he could only manage a fifth-place showing and 9% of the vote in the New Hampshire GOP primary. Both Huckabee and Robertson quickly headed to South Carolina to try to resuscitate their campaigns in its primary, but there were no revivals: Huckabee finished second there, and Robertson third. CNN surveyed 64 Iowa GOP insiders, including state legislators, local elected and party officials, veterans of previous caucus campaigns, and other party operatives, and asked them if a relatively strong showing by any of this year's more conservative trio could lead to a legitimate run for the GOP nomination by rallying the faith vote. And in the state that knows that vote well, there were doubters. If Bachmann, Perry or Santorum is able to finish in the top three in the caucuses, do you think that candidate will be able to consolidate the born-again/evangelical vote and become a significant factor in the GOP nominating contest? â€¢ Yes: 46% â€¢ No: 54% The Iowa GOP insiders' skepticism was informed in part at least by what happened four years ago. ""Huckabee couldn't do it and he was a much better candidate,"" observed one Iowa GOP insider. Maybe Santorum or Bachmann or Perry could consolidate the religious vote for a while, allowed another GOP insider: ""Be a significant factor in the GOP nominating contest? No, the Huckabee campaign confirmed this in 2008."" RELATED: Two out of three think Romney will win RELATED: Some Iowa Republicans want more options And even several of those yeses were qualified. ""Bachmann and Perry are finished, they just don't know it yet,"" said one Iowa GOP insider dismissively. ""Santorum could ride the wave for a while, but I doubt to the nomination."" Another echoed, ""Santorum could become the anti-Mitt, but (the) lack of a national organization and fundraising will be an impediment. He'd need to suddenly catch fire in South Carolina and he'll have a tough time with resources in Florida."" The CNN Iowa GOP insiders were surveyed from the evening of December 27 through the morning of December 30. Most of the survey was conducted over the Internet; some interviews were conducted by phone. The Iowa insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers in order to encourage candid responses. And while some insiders were aligned with one or another of the presidential campaigns, more than two-thirds said they had not endorsed and were not working for any candidate in the race.

Clark insisted the mood in Villa’s camp remains healthy. ‘We’ve got too many good attacking players to not be scoring goals,’ he said. ‘We’re confident in ourselves and do it every day in training. ‘We’ll use the disappointment we have had from previous years to spur us on. It’s a horrible feeling walking into the dressing room knowing that you’ve been knocked out of the cup. It’s even worse when it’s a lower-league team, it’s devastating.’ Clark called on his team-mates to relieve the pressure on Lambert by producing a convincing win. ‘The manager does take a lot of the flak when the results aren’t going our way,’ he said. ‘We know as a group of lads that some of the games we have played in we should have got better results. I think it’s time for us to step up and start taking a lot of the responsibility ourselves. ‘The manager can only do so much in the week. The lads are all happy with what we’re doing leading up to the games. It’s about the time we get out on the pitch. Cup runs bring everyone together.

Ann Holding, 48, hanged herself in a barn after believing she was between three and four months pregnant - despite having just received a negative pregnancy test result. The cleaner, from Cadbury, Devon, had complained to doctors she felt ‘bloated and had backache’, which she believed were symptoms of being pregnant. She also told her GP that she ‘felt something moving inside her’ and thought she was three or four months pregnant even though she had a flat abdomen, an inquest into her death heard. Her husband Steven told the hearing, held at Exeter County Hall today, that her concern may have stemmed from the fact that she did not realise she was pregnant with her daughter, who was born in 1987. He said: ‘She was wearing size 10 jeans and carried on working. ‘The day before she was banging in some fence stakes and helped me with a mobile disco. It showed what a strong and determined lady she was.’ He also told the hearing how their relationship had been affected in 2012 when his wife started to worry about paying heating bills and keeping warm in their home. He said she went to bed dressed in clothes and he said he did not ‘attempt sexual advances’ because of her problems but admitted she may have ‘read the wrong thing into it’. He said his wife had never harmed herself or contemplated suicide before but was found hanged at a barn in Rackenford, Devon, in October last year. At an inquest at Exeter County Hall (above), Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland recorded a verdict of suicide and said that farmer's daughter Ann Holding was 'increasingly overwhelmed by the pressures of daily living' Family members said the couple had not been getting on but ‘would not expand any further’.

Rahman took home two Oscars for the movie ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Composer A. R. Rahman, ""The Mozart of Madras,"" celebrates his double Oscar win -- for Best Score and one for the song ""Jai Ho"" from the film. Rahman's wins -- one for the song ""Jai Ho"" and the other for Best Score -- were just two reasons for Indians to erupt in boisterous celebrations Monday morning. ""Slumdog,"" which was shot in the streets and slums of Mumbai bagged eight golden statuettes in total, including one for Best Sound Mixing. Indian Resul Pookutty shared it with fellow sound editors who worked on the film. ""This is the finest hour of Indian cinema in the global scenario,"" said Anand Sharma, the country's junior external affairs minister. Indians crowded around television sets in dorm rooms, restaurants and homes, exhaling in relief as Rahman's name was announced as the winner. They high-fived each other, hugged, shrieked and wept. ""I cannot describe this feeling,"" said Nikhil Jyonti, a Mumbai resident. ""I'm bursting with pride for India."" In the Mumbai slum of Dharavi, where many of the scenes in ""Slumdog"" were shot, a television  was set out for the street children to watch the ceremony. Few in the teeming slum of one million people had heard of the Oscars, but they knew Rahman's win was a source of pride for the country. Danny Boyle's rags-to-riches film tells the story of a tea-boy at a Mumbai call center who earns a spot in the Indian version of the quiz show ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?"" He raises the suspicion of the show's host when, despite the lack of a formal education, he begins to answer the increasingly difficult questions with ease. The movie also won four Golden Globes and a host of honors at other award shows. While the overwhelming sentiment was one of pride Monday, the movie has faced backlash from many Indian movie critics who took exception to its depiction of Mumbai's underworld without highlighting any of the city's achievements. Among the most notable criticisms was one offered by Amitabh Bachchan, considered the most successful movie star in Bollywood history, and a former real-life host of the Indian ""Millionaire."" The film,"" he said, ""projects India as the third world's dirty underbelly ... and causes pain and disgust among nationalists and patriots."" But most Mumabikers, still reeling from a terrorist attack in their city in November, embraced the movie while looking for something positive to root for. They found that in Rahman, a composer who has consistently broken barriers in his musical scores for dozens of Bollywood hits and is known as the ""Mozart of Madras."" Rahman has sold more than 200 million albums worldwide -- more than the Beatles -- but has remained relatively unknown in Europe and the United States. Director Spike Lee used one of his songs in his 2006 heist film, ""Inside Man."" Many hope the Oscar win will bring Rahman greater exposure. Rahman and Pookutty, however, aren't the first Indians with Academy Awards to their names. In 1992, legendary Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray received an honorary award for his contribution to world cinema. And in 1982, Bhanu Athaiya shared an Oscar for costume design for the movie ""Gandhi."" CNN's Saeed Ahmed and Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report"

Baroness Boothroyd, a respected and much-loved figure on all sides at Westminster, accused the Prime Minister of a ‘careless disregard for the way our constitution works’. She even suggested that the position of International Development Secretary Justine Greening should be downgraded to allow the new Lords leader Baroness Stowell to enjoy the same rank as all of her predecessors. Furious: The much-loved Baroness Boothroyd accused the Prime Minister of a ‘careless disregard for the way our constitution works’ The row has been caused by the Prime Minister’s decision not to grant Lady Stowell full Cabinet status after his reshuffle earlier this month. He decided to downgrade Lady Stowell because of a legal limit on the number of full Cabinet posts and salaries. Awkward: William Hague (left) has kept his place in the Cabinet despite being demoted by David Cameron (right) and he has also kept his salary The problem with numbers arose because William Hague, in being demoted to Leader of the Commons, has been given Cabinet status – despite the fact that the post did not attract the full Cabinet rank or salary when held by Andrew Lansley. As a consequence, Lady Stowell can attend Cabinet but is not allowed to vote, and is being paid the Lords’ minister of state salary of £78,891 a year, compared with the £101,038 that her predecessor, Lord Hill, received. The unprecedented move has prompted angry protests from senior figures from all three main parties in the House of Lords. Betty Boothroyd has suggested that the position of International Development Secretary Justine Greening (left) be downgraded to allow the new Lords leader Baroness Stowell (right( to enjoy the same rank and priviieges as all of her predecessors Lady Boothroyd, speaking in an emergency debate in the upper house last night, warned peers they lived in ‘dangerous times’ thanks to Mr Cameron’s decision. ‘The Prime Minister’s demotion of this House in his Cabinet reshuffle challenges its rights, its authority and its long-established role and status in the constitution,’ she said. ‘It breaks the mould of British history. It strikes at the very roots of our bicameral parliament. The place of this House in the Cabinet of every prime minister has never been challenged – until now. ‘I never thought I would witness such careless disregard for the way our constitution works.’ Lady Boothroyd said it was a ‘dead certainty’ that Lady Stowell’s downgraded status would be used as an excuse to ignore the views of the Lords. And, although international development secretaries have been Cabinet ministers since Labour’s Clare Short in 1997, Lady Boothroyd challenged Mr Cameron over the post’s elevated status. She said Mr Cameron’s claim that his hands were tied by the restrictions on the numbers of full Cabinet ministers in the Ministerial Salaries Act 1975 was ‘a pretence’. ‘Which section of that Act dictated that he promoted the Minister for Overseas Development [Miss Greening] to the Cabinet and demoted the Leader of the Lords?’ she demanded. ‘Why is the minister for overseas aid made a secretary of state, with full Cabinet rank and pay, while the salary of the leader of this House and her status is downgraded?’ In an attempt to contain the row, Number 10 said Mr Cameron regarded Lady Stowell’s position as ‘a purely temporary one’ which he aimed to rectify ‘at the earliest opportunity’. The Prime Minister has said he will restore the full Cabinet status of the Leader of the Lords ‘immediately after the election’ if he remains in power."

Allen, a former Australian golfing professional and regular on SEN radio, was talking major moot points from the Ryder Cup Golf Tournament with SEN host Kevin Bartlett when the hands-free interview he was conducting went horribly wrong. The golfing guru was halfway through his expert commentary, when the sound of two cars colliding burst through the speakers of  listeners' airwaves during their drive home from work. Scroll down for Audio The black Mercedes Mark Allen was driving when he hit the driver in front during Monday's The Run Home segment The pair were chatting on the radio network's The Run Home segment, before the sound of Allen's shiny black Mercedes was heard crashing in to the car in front. The pair joked about the fact he was 'obviously on hands free' before Allen was immediately instructed not to say anything further following about the crash due to 'legal reasons.' Host Kevin Bartlett said it was 'the first time we've had a crash on live radio.' 'Can you believe that he's had a crash while speaking on radio, that is a first, that is an absolute first,' he said. 'I reckon's that'd  make a good promo, don't you think?' he asked listeners. Twitter users compared the golfer's skills to his poor driving capabilities Mark Allen, left, was talking with AFL great and host of The Run Home when the incident occurred on Monday afternoon Prior to the mid-afternoon bingle Allen had been providing expert commentary on the Ryder Cup tournament where he was breaking-down the swings of each European and US golfer. He was just about to start getting started on world number 11 Phil Mickelson before crashing into the car in front. He had been referring to statistics inside the car of each golfer, but insisted he was driving and talking in a legal manner when he came to rest on a Melbourne road. 'Ohh, I've just crashed KB, I've just crashed...I've just crashed my car.' He confirmed he and the woman were both uninjured. Most concerning to Kevin Bartlett was not the safety of the occupants involved, however, but the mere fact he'd just buckled his bright looking Mercedes. 'Not the Mercedes?' Bartlett said. Allen, upon reassuring listeners about his rear-end bingle, told Bartlett the situation was under control. 'Yeah, I'm OK, everybody's OK, the lady in front is OK.' To Bartlett's surprise, he thought Allen had pulled over on the side of the road but was in fact using his hands-free device to talk and drive at the same time. Moments after the incident Allen put a call out to his Mercedes dealer in a plug for the car company to tell him that the vehicle was 'OK.' 'If Craig Howard is listening from Berry Mercedes Benz, everything is OK Craig.' It appeared Mr Howard was listening, and he instructed Bartlett to tell Allen not to say anything further 'for legal reasons.' 'Don't say anything for legal reasons that's what's coming through from Craig Howard at the moment.' Bartlett said the network were considering using the crash audio as a future 'promo' for the show."

Children should stop using it to mean ‘fanciable’ because it can lead to girls feeling self-conscious about their appearance while exercising, says Helen Fraser. Girls should be able to get ‘pink in the face and tousled’ without worrying about whether they were having a ‘bad hair day’. Attractive young schoolgirls should not be called 'fit' to mean 'fanciable' as it puts them off physical education, a girls' education chief will say today (library image) Mrs Fraser, chief executive of the Girls’ Day School Trust (GDST), believes girls should be concerned about their running speed instead of worrying ‘does my bum look big in this?’. In a speech to the trust’s annual conference today, Mrs Fraser will say: ‘What on earth has happened to the word fit, which used to mean that you could run a few miles without collapsing but now just means “fanciable”? ‘I think sport and exercise is one of the ways in which women can reclaim their bodies from the kind of obsessions of the tabloid press and celebrity magazines. ‘It is not about being fat or thin, it is about being fit. It is not about how you look, but about what you do.’ She will add: ‘Really great inclusive sport takes girls away from all those unhelpful thoughts of bodily perfection and focuses them on the team and the goals. ‘I have been in our schools when a class of teenage girls is returning from a sports lesson, pink in the face, tousled, throwing themselves down on the floor – with never a moment of “am I having a bad hair day”, or “does my bum look big in this”.’ Helen Fraser will say girls shouldn't worry about 'getting pink in the face' or if their 'bum looks big' while exercising (library image) Mrs Fraser will also urge schools to impress upon girls the importance of sport ‘more forcefully’. By the age of eight or nine, girls are already less active than boys and by the time they are 14, only 12 per cent of girls are as active as they should be. Mrs Fraser will highlight a lack of ‘cultural representations of women and girls who are physically powerful, fast and strong’. She will also criticise different treatment of the sexes in professional sport, with sponsorship and media attention skewed in favour of men. ‘Women’s football and women’s cricket gets less funding, less media attention,’ she says. ‘A Premier League boss sends sexist emails. Newspapers print allegations that Jessica Ennis is fat (that was before she won her gold medal),’ she will say. She will point out that many successful women have a strong sporting past including Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, who was a member of the French national synchronised swimming team, and Condoleezza Rice, the former US Secretary of State, who is an accomplished golfer. ‘It is important to have cultural representations of women and girls who are physically powerful, and fast and strong,’ she says. The GDST – which runs 24 private and two state academies  – has attempted to create a culture of ‘sport for all’ with classes in Zumba and tai chi as well as traditional team games."

'I didn't want to killer her,' Mr Krichbaum told The Northern Virginia Daily. 'I wanted her to go away and stop biting me.' Mr Krichbaum told the paper how he remembered the moment the bear sunk its teeth into his leg during the attack after his dog chased the two cubs into the forest. Mr Krichbaum said while he was being attacked his dog Henry managed to distract the bear, who then went for the pet, which allowed him to pick up a rock. Mr Krichbaum then struck the bear in the head with the rock, allowing him and his dog to return to their car before driving to a Frederick County fruit market in search of assistance. Mr Krichbaum, 59, of Staunton, Virginia, is treated for his injuries after being attacked by a bear. His brave pet Henry sits in between his legs Mr Krichbaum has described how Henry distracted the bear as it attacked him, before he managed to strike the bear with a rock Mr Krichbaum was then taken to Winchester Medical Center where he received treatment for the severe injuries. The bear has since evaded attempts to capture it following the attack, the Associated Press has reported. Traps were set by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources the day after the attack but removed on Monday. Colin Carpenter, the West Virginia Division of Natural Resource’s black bear project leader, told The Winchester Star on Friday that authorities planned to kill the bear and her cubs if they captured them.

The petition, posted on change.org, had 2,000 signatures by yesterday. Jamie Sajecki, Virginia’s black bear project leader, told The Northern Virginia Daily, how the state does not take action against bears if they are provoked into attacking, which he said is what appears to have happened in this instance. He said: 'Because the dog precipitated this event, we wouldn’t necessarily put a bear down in that situation because she was out in her habitat where she should have been.'"

For his decades of unjust incarceration, the state of Texas awarded him nearly $6million in compensation after his August, 2009 release, which is in accordance with a relatively new Texas law that specifies the amount of compensation exonerated prisoners are to receive. Then came the legal bills - his attorneys charged him more than $1million for work they claim to have done to lobby Texas lawmakers to increase the amount of compensation for exonerees. Then came his ex-wife. Justice delayed: Steven Phillips spent 24 years in prison for crimes he didn't commit. He was awarded $6million for his time in prison - and now his ex-wife wants a piece of the action Phillips and his former bride, Traci Tucker, were expecting their first child in 1982, when Phillips was first charged in the case that ultimately would send him to prison for more than two decades. They divorced nearly 10 years later, in 1992, after Phillips says they 'grew apart.' Now the two are engaged in an ongoing legal battle over compensation she claims she is owed for wages lost by her former husband's incarceration. “He was a victim of a wrongful justice system, and his family was also,” Tucker tells the Texas Tribune. Last year, a Dallas County judge awarded Tucker more than $150,000 of Phillips' compensation, a ruling Phillips has since appealed. The case is likely headed to the Texas Supreme Court, where justices will determine what - if any - sort of compensation former spouses of exonerated prisoners should receive. In 2009, the Texas Legislature passed the Tim Cole Act, which raised the compensation for exonerated prisoners to $160,000 for each year a person was wrongfully imprisoned. For the 24 years Phillips spent behind bars, he received a lump-sum payment of more than $2million. Additionally, he will receive a monthly annuity of about $11,000, as well as medical and education benefits from the state. Compensation: Traci Tucker feels she is owed compensation for the 24 years her ex-husband spent in prison But Phillips contends that the compensation is not for lost wages. Rather, he claims in his appeal, it's a mandatory payment he is owed under the law for his time spent behind bars. Texas state Senator Rodney Ellis, one of the architects of the Tim Cole Act, seems to agree. In an affidavit filed in the case, Ellis writes that the legislature never intended to compensate exonerees for lost wages; otherwise it would have been based on their income prior to their incarceration and be subject to taxes (as the law is written, compensation for exonerees is tax-free). Ellis notes that the Legislature recognized that a man cannot support his children while in prison, which is 'we drafted the compensation statute to include any child support payments and interest on child support arrearage that are owed by the exoneree.' The affidavit was not allowed into evidence. After winning his freedom, Phillips is back in court fighting for compensation Another of the law's architects, state Senator Rafael Anchia, says lawmakers had failed to consider former spouses of exonerees when drafting the law. 'This is an example of the law of unintended consequences,' he says 'We did not think about entitlement by spouses who had become divorced from these innocent men while they were in prison.' Regardless of the law, Tucker says she had every intention of sticking it out with Phillips while he was in prison. “To me, marriage was for life, and I was going to be with him forever, and we were going to get through this — or so I thought,” she says. Prior to the divorce, Tucker claims she visited Phillips frequently and provided him with money to buy things in the prison's commissary. At his trial, Tucker was Phillips' star witness. The string of sexual assaults for which Phillips was wrongly convicted happened in 1982. Several women were attacked and forced to perform sex acts at gun point. At least two of the victims wrongly identified Phillips. Tucker provided Phillips' alibi, testifying that he couldn't be the person committing the assaults because she was with him when some of the assaults took place. Phillips was convicted anyway and sentenced to two 30-year prison sentences. He subsequently pleaded guilty to several other, similar crimes to avoid what would likely have been a life sentence had he been found guilty. In 2001, Phillips began learning about DNA and - with the help of the Innocence Project - was able to have his DNA tested against DNA found at the scenes of crimes supposedly committed by him. The DNA didn't match. However, it did match a convicted sex criminal Sydney Alvin Goodyear. 'This is one of the worst cases of tunnel vision we’ve ever seen. Police seized on Steven Phillips as a suspect and refused to see mounting evidence that someone else actually committed these crimes,' said Innocence Project Co-Director Barry Scheck. 'Sidney Goodyear was a one-man crime spree who could have been stopped much sooner if police had followed the evidence instead of locking onto an innocent man.' After the Dallas crimes for which Phillips was wrongfully convicted, Goodyear committed at least 16 other sexual assaults and related offenses in multiple states. Of the lawsuit and inflated bill from his attorneys, Phillips - who says he has no ill-will against his ex - sums his situation up as follows: 'When the cheese is on the table, the rats come out.'"

Gloria Killian was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 32 years to life in 1985 for a murder she first heard about on the evening news. An elderly couple, Ed and Grace Davies were shot in 1981 during a robbery of six cases of silver at their home in Sacramento, California. Mr Davies died while Mrs Davies, who had been shot in the head, managed to crawl from her home and survived. Scroll down for video Joyce Ride (pictured left), the mother of astronaut Sally Ride, spent $100,000 to help free Gloria Killian (right) who was locked up for 17 years for a murder she did not commit The murders were committed by Stephen DeSantis and his cousin Gary Masse. An anonymous tip-off named DeSantis and Masse, sparking a huge police hunt. When officers tracked down Masse's wife Joanne, she told them that a woman named Gloria had orchestrated the robbery. Mr Davies was a customer at the coin shop where Gloria Killian, then a 35-year-old law student, worked. None of this information was known to Ms Killian when police asked her to the station to answer questions about the murders. Within hours, she found herself arrested and charged with capital murder. However after almost five months in jail, the case against the 35-year-old was dismissed on lack of evidence. Meanwhile, Masse had been convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole. On the day he began that sentence, he called the district attorney and said that he would testify against Killian in exchange for 25 years inside. Gloria Killian, from California, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 32 years to life in 1985 for a murder she first heard about on the evening news. Killian, who had no criminal past and protested her innocence, was tried, convicted and sentenced to 32 years to life - despite the fact DeSantis said at his trial that the woman had nothing to do with the murder and robbery. Each appeal Ms Killian lodged was lost. For a time, she faced the possibility of the death penalty until a change in the law in 1983 saw the option vetoed for murder accomplices. In an interview with the American Public Media last year, she said: 'The worst was about seven years in. It happens to lifers between five and seven years. 'I guess reality hits you in the face. You lose all hope. You lose everything.' Killian spent the years using her own legal education to help others fight their cases at the California Institution for Women prison at Chino. It was here, in the early 1990s, that she met Joyce Ride, the mother of the first woman in space Sally Ride. Mrs Ride had dedicated her life to helping women behind bars and visited Chino through organization Friends Outside. Mrs Ride, a Californian housewife, said that, at first, her daughter Sally could not understand why she was visiting prisons. Mrs Ride, who is now 90, met Ms Killian when she worked with her on ways to help victims of domestic abuse in prison. After a year of conversations, Mrs Ride finally asked what had put Ms Killian in jail. On hearing the story, the housewife said that she felt profoundly that Killian was innocent. She told CNN: 'I'm annoyed by injustice. Profoundly annoyed. This was clearly an injustice.' Despite protests from the prisoner, Mrs Ride started financing a private investigation and legal battle. In total, it cost Mrs Ride $100,000 of her own money, with the elderly widow selling stocks to pay lawyers. The investigation was triumphant - a letter emerged which exposed Masse's testimony as bogus in order to further his own leniency deal. Killian's prosecutor did not share this letter with the defense at the original trial. The prosecutor against Ms Killian, Christopher Cleland, was 'admonished' for failing to disclose the vital evidence - an unclear punishment at best. Another letter came to light - where Masse admitted 'he lied [his] ass off on the stand'. Without Masse's sworn testimony, the case was baseless and the murder conviction against Killian was overturned. Ms Killian was released from prison in 2002 and Mrs Ride, then in her 70s, was waiting to pick her up at the gate. Ms Ride told CNN: 'Seeing her walk out was a really great joy. It was like a load was lifted off my shoulders.' A decade on, the women share a home in Claremont, California along with a third woman that Ms Killian made friends with in prison.

Swann, who retired from cricket during England's miserable winter tour to Australia, earlier this week urged captain Cook to give up his limited-overs place and allow the likes of Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Vince and James Taylor the chance to show what they can do in a more exciting and attacking line-up.

He wrote in his column in The Sun on Friday: 'Real mates are honest with each other. I'm no longer in the England dressing room and it is my job now as a pundit to give my honest thoughts. 'I think being one-day captain is a poisoned chalice for him. He just doesn't need the job.

Measures to lower the number of Canada geese close to John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia international airports have been in place since last summer, said Carol Bannerman, spokeswoman for the USDA's Wildlife Services. New York City officials asked for federal assistance with solving the goose problem after US Airways flight 1549 was cripped by a bird strike and narrowly avoided crashing by successfully landing in the Hudson River in January 2009. ""Our responsibility is to look at safety hazards and the Canada geese can represent a significant aviation hazard,"" Bannerman said. The round-up last week came to light in New York media on Tuesday. The group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) issued a statement criticizing the euthanization and calling on authorities to use other methods to keep birds away from airports. ""Killing every goose within a seven-mile radius of an airport doesn't fly -- it isn't humane, and it isn't a viable solution for either people or birds,"" PETA said in the statement. ""When geese are killed, more birds simply move in to use available resources, and the temporary spike in the food supply results in accelerated breeding. What follows is a vicious killing cycle that is cruel, expensive, and pointless."" The group cited other methods including a radar system at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to detect flocks of birds, as well as lasers and pyrotechnics, as being better ways to change birds' flight paths. The Brooklyn geese, which are molting at this time of year and cannot fly, were herded into a fenced area, put in poultry crates and taken to a facility where they were euthanized with carbon dioxide, said Bannerman. The geese were later bagged and buried in a landfill, she said. Last month the radius from JFK and LaGuardia airports where Canada geese would be removed and euthanized was increased from five to seven miles and Bannerman said the new radius included Brooklyn's Prospect Park. ""JFK and LaGuardia are between six and seven miles from Prospect Park border-to-border,"" she said adding that she understood that attachment that people in the area have to the geese. ""We made the process as least stressful as possible for the geese,"" she said. Ed Bahlman, who said he is 60 years old and has been going to Prospect Park most of his life, called the removal of the geese ""unnecessary."" He said that he and his companion go to the park most mornings at around 7 a.m, and had started feeding a goose they called ""Beaky"" early last year. The goose had lost it's upper beak to a fishing hook. ""On Wednesday all the geese were there, we fed Beaky and on Thursday they were gone. Beaky was gone, too,"" he said. Bahlman who said he found zip ties and rope in the park said that the authorities had accomplished nothing by killing the geese. ""They have done a lot of harm and we don't believe they have done anything to help the public, they've done more harm than good,"" he said. Peter Brown, who said he was a fireman who has lived in the area all his life and goes to the park regularly with his 10 year old son said that although he thought the geese were beautiful and understood that it had upset the neighborhood, he agreed with the decision to remove them. ""What's more important, 200 geese or 200 people? That's the choice that has to be made,"" he said adding that he flies frequently. Bannerman said Canada geese were responsible for over 600 damaging airstrikes to U.S. planes between 1990 and 2008, and that their population was rapidly increasing. ""The Canada goose population increased from 19,000 in 1981 to 250,000 in 2008, making it a 12-fold increases in almost 30 years,"" she said. Bannerman said that 1,200 Canada geese were euthanized in 2009 in 17 New York locations."

In an emotional interview with The Mail on Sunday, Barry Steenkamp said he was struggling ‘to find some reason why this happened to our lovely daughter’. Pistorius broke down in tears in court when he was formally charged with Reeva Steenkamp’s premeditated murder and Mr Steenkamp said: ‘He must be going through things that we don’t know about. There is no hatred in our hearts.’ Ms Steenkamp, 29, had been dating the Olympic athlete, a double-amputee known as the Blade Runner, since November. She was shot dead in the early hours of Valentine’s Day at his gated mansion in Pretoria. It has been reported she was hit four times by bullets fired through the door of a bathroom. Pistorius, 26, a keen marksman, owned a pistol and machine gun. Sources told how he carried his dying girlfriend from the bathroom, her blood splattering the staircase, as he desperately tried to revive her. The pair had been called South Africa’s ‘golden couple’, and the arrest of Pistorius – who in London last year became the first man to compete at both an Olympics and Paralympics – was met with disbelief. Speaking for the first time since the death of his law graduate daughter, Mr Steenkamp, a horse trainer, wept as he said he and his wife June were at ‘a complete loss’. He said: ‘This is a very difficult time for us. June is inconsolable. We just need to find some answers. We ask the Lord every day to help us find a reason why this should happen to Reeva. She was the most beautiful, kind girl in the world. She had love for everyone, and she was loved by everyone who knew her.’ Mr Steenkamp said he had never met Pistorius but his wife occasionally spoke to him on the phone.On the day of the killing, Ms Steenkamp had been due to give a talk to high school pupils ‘to empower them to be confident’. Her father said: ‘That’s what she was like, always wanting to help others.’ Tragic: Mr Steenkamp, a horse trainer, wept as he said he and his wife June were at 'a complete loss' Blade Runner: Pistorius ran in both the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics last year Former girlfriends of the Paralympian have publicly suggested he has a dark side. One, 26-year-old student Samantha Taylor, said he is ‘certainly not what people think he is’. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Ms Taylor has been warned  to expect a subpoena, forcing her to give evidence at Pistorius’s trial. Ms Steenkamp appeared on a TV programme, Tropika Island of Treasure, in South Africa last night, which sees celebrities paired with contestants competing for a cash prize. Executive producer Samantha Moon claimed the programme had the backing of Reeva’s family. She said: ‘This is how they want to remember her.’ Reeva’s funeral will be on Tuesday, the same day Pistorius  is due in  court where it is understood lawyers will say the shooting was a tragic accident."

The man, in his 30s, was gunned down after firing a .357 Magnum revolver as armed officers swarmed into his house in the eastern city of Strasbourg. Seven others, including another gunman in Paris, were arrested during a nationwide anti-terrorist operation. Sting operation: A man, in his 30s, was shot dead as police arrested terror suspects around France Armed siege: A policeman from the GIPN - French national police intervention groups - stands guard outside a building in Cannes, southeastern France, where me connected with an extremist Islamic group were arrested Dramatic scenes: All the men arrested are believed to be part of the Salafist group which is waging a holy war in Europe Organised: The anti-terror operation was carried out in several cities around France - notably in Strasbourg where a suspect was fatally wounded All were suspected of being involved in an attack on a Jewish shop in which one person was slightly injured last month. The extreme violence used by the authorities in the face of Muslim extremism was praised by President Francois Hollande who 'saluted the action of the police' and urged Interior Minister Manuel Valls to 'take all measures necessary to ensure vigilance.' All the men targetted today were said to be linked to a Salafist group which is committed to waging a jihad - or holy war - across Europe. It follows Mohammed Merah, a 23-year-old French Algerian with similar Salafism connections, shooting seven people, including four Jews, dead in the Toulouse area in March. At least three policemen were injured in today's Strasboug raid, while others received direct hits to their bullet proof jackets and helmets. Heavily armed: Police officers wore full protective clothing including bullet proof vests, helmets and shields The anti-terror operation comes after extremist Mohammed Merah killed seven people - including four Jews - in Toulouse in March The suspect, meanwhile, was hit by a number of bullets and died at the scene, despite being treated by medics for his wounds. The source said the man's veiled wife and child were in the Strasbourg house, and that the woman was one of those arrested for questioning. 'He was initially on the sofa, but then started to fire at police with a .357 Magnum,' the source added. Dawn raid: Police raided the building in the Esplanade suburb of Strasbourg in the early hours on Saturday morning It was part of a nationwide counter-terrorist operation aimed at capturing the gang responsible for planting a low explosive device in a kosher food shop in the northern Paris suburb of Sarcelles on September 19th. A judicial source in the French capital said all the men targeted today were thought to be members of a secretive Salafist group. Referring to another Paris suburb, the source said: 'A prosecutor in Pontoise was recently withdrawn from the case and replaced with an anti-terrorist prosecutor in Paris. It was him who sanctioned this morning's raids. 'Armed police visited a number of addresses across the country in coordinated raids. The suspect in Strasbourg tried to resist arrest by firing at officers who had stormed into his home.' The raids were coordinated by the Central Directorate of Internal Intelligence (DCRI) and the terrorism sub-directorate (SDAT) of the Judicial Police. The source said that a gunman arrested in Paris had been acting in a 'threatening and dangerous manner' but was quickly disarmed with no injuries. An Interior Ministry spokesman said raids had today (sat) taken place at addresses in cities all over the country, and notably in Nice, Cannes, and Paris. He said there had been seven arrests in all. Police have been on heightened alert since the attacks by Merah, who was himself finally shot dead by police. Merah had strong links to Salafist groups in the Toulouse area, where he was brought up, and there are fears that they may have assisted his murderous crimes. Crime scene investigation: Police leaving the building in Strasburg, eastern France, where a man linked to the extremist Salafist group was shot dead Arrests: Around 11 other men believed to be connected to the extremist Salafist group were arrested at locations around France Dangerous: At least three policemen were injured during the raid while others received direct hits to their bullet proof jackets"

In a fresh escalation of the diplomatic tensions between Britain and Spain over Gibraltar, Mr Rajoy promised to take 'all necessary legal steps' in the stand-off after holding a meeting with King Juan Carlos. It comes as British warships are being sent to Gibraltar by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond to demonstrate the Royal Navy’s ‘formidable strength. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy promised to take 'all necessary legal steps' to protect his country's interests Stand-off: The Spanish PM spoke out after holding talks with Spain's King Juan Carlos (right) at the Marivent Palace in Palma de Mallorca Three ships including the frigate HMS Westminster depart for Gibraltar on Monday even as the diplomatic row with Madrid escalates over plans for draconian border controls. Mr Rajoy said he hoped to hold talks with Britain to end the dispute over shipping and increased border checks. But until then he would step up unilateral action to protect Spain from outside threats. He said: 'I hope that this doesn't go any further, but it's clear that Spain has to defend its national interest and that's what we're going to do.' Setting sail: HMS Westminster will leave Britain on Monday and is expected in Gibraltar from August 19 Ship shape: A sailor polishes HMS Westminster's ship's bell ahead of her deployment on Cougar 13 Supplies: Food and drink is prepared to keeping troops fighting fit while taking part in the exercise Downing Street said it was aware of the remarks, which come just two days after David Cameron warned Mr Rajoy that increased checks and plans to charge £43 to enter and leave the Rock were ‘totally disproportionate and unacceptable’. It was seen as coded warning that Britain is prepared to take Spain to court if it goes ahead with measures which are seen to be in breach of European law. With diplomatic relations between Britain and Spain over Gibraltar already in the deep freeze, the Ministry of Defence announced details of the naval deployment to the region, called Cougar ’13. Mr Hammond said the planned deployment of a total of 10 vessels to the region as part of a rapid reaction force will underline the Navy’s 'global reach'. The move comes just days after Gibraltar’s chief minister called for the British military to send forces into the area. Ten vessels including the aircraft carrier Illustrious, two frigates and support ships are heading to the waters off Gibraltar as part of an annual exercise. Gibraltar-bound: RFA Lyme Bay is heading to The Rock as as part of the deployment to the Mediterranean and Gulf region Trucks and jeeps are loaded on to RFA Lyme Bay as part of the deployment of the Response Force Task Group Loading up: Vehicles are driven on to RFA Lyme Bay for exercise Cougar All aboard: A crane lifts equipment on to RFA Lyme Bay as part of the deployment to 'protect the free, safe and lawful use of the sea' News that British warships are heading to Gibraltar is likely to add to the tensions with Spain But defence officials revealed that three of them – the frigate Westminster and two support vessels – will call in at the British sovereign base at Gibraltar for three days, beginning on August 19. In a show of force, the warships will practise ‘a range of operations’ including ‘deterring adversaries’. Mr Hammond said: ‘Since its creation under the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Response Force Task Group has demonstrated its formidable strength and readiness to respond to emerging threats worldwide through a number of operations and exercises. ‘This now routine and long-planned deployment will demonstrate once again its ability to operate as a rapid reaction force on behalf of the UK and, importantly, underlines the global reach and flexibility of the modern Royal Navy.’ The deployment follows demands from the government of Gibraltar for the coalition to beef up its naval presence off the Rock, and calls for gunboat diplomacy from Tory MPs. Commodore Paddy McAlpine, Commander UK Task Group, said: 'Cougar 13 is a bespoke opportunity to enhance the Royal Navy’s enduring core skill – the ability to operate and project power as a task group at range. In so doing, it will also remind interested domestic and international parties of the enduring utility, employability and interoperability of the Royal Navy. 'During Cougar 13 we will engage with our partner nations through a series of exercises, reinforcing our commitment and demonstrating our contribution to security in the Mediterranean and Gulf region.' Mr Cameron broke the news that the task force was set to sail to Mr Rajoy in the tense phone call on Wednesday which failed to resolve the diplomatic standoff. Ready for anything: Ahead of the deployment, the Vikings of the Armoured Support Group spent last week on the ranges at Lulworth in Dorset to hone their shooting skills Tensions: The British Foreign Office fears the proposed Spanish border charges would penalise islanders who regularly commute to Spain for work Downing Street claimed Mr Rajoy had offered to ‘de-escalate’ the  crisis after Mr Cameron issued a coded warning that Britain might take Spain to the European Court of Justice over the ‘disproportionate’ border checks. But within minutes of the call, the Spanish government insisted they were doing nothing wrong. Spanish foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo has threatened to impose tolls at the border and ban Gibraltar-bound aircraft from Spanish airspace because the government of Gibraltar sank concrete blocks off the Rock to deter Spanish fishermen. On the move: HMS Montrose sailing from HMNB Devonport in preparation for Operation Cougar On the move: RFA Fort Victoria (left) and HMS Montrose will leave the UK on Monday Support RFA Diligence is among the vessels providing support to the military exercise Cougar 13 Last night Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, a member of the all-party Parliamentary group on Gibraltar, said: ‘It’s wonderful news that the Royal Navy is on its way but I’d prefer it if this deployment was in response to the behaviour of the Spanish. ‘If they’re going down there, they might as well stay while this situation is going on. ‘The most powerful thing we could do is to announce that the Queen is going to visit. That would send the strongest signal that Gibraltar is British.’ Appeal: David Cameron asked the Spanish Prime Minister to scale back contentious border checks with the British territory, including blocking flights to Gibraltar Access: The Spanish government raised the prospect of imposing a 50 euros (£43) charge on vehicles entering Gibraltar and closing Spanish airspace to flights heading for the Rock On the ground, Spanish officials again forced motorists to wait for hours yesterday, imposing more border checks when they spotted UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall viewing their operations. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ‘The Royal Navy’s annual Cougar deployment is long-planned and well-established. ‘Gibraltar is a strategic base for UK defence and as such Royal Navy ships visit its waters throughout the year as part of a range of regular and routine deployments.’ Warship: The Ministry of Defence stressed that the movement of the nine-vessel Response Force Task Group was 'long-planned'"

People who did not participate in the race may be overwhelmed even though they did not experience the trauma directly. Not only is grieving necessary says Carter, so is looking back at how far Boston has come as a community. 'The progress these guys have been able to make is largely because of the generosity of strangers. In the midst of the horror and all the evil that was there, look at the good thatâ€™s been coming out,' he said. Carter will be in Hopkinton on Marathon Monday to support the runners raising money for his rehab. He spoke of the importance of coming together to help one another after the tragic event. Carter has helped many survivors come to terms with their fear and anger but says it is really the community that must help one another cope with overcoming obstacles. 'The progress these guys have been able to make is largely because of the generosity of strangers. In the midst of the horror and all the evil that was there, look at the good thatâ€™s been coming out,' he said. Being, or more appropriately the mantra 'Boston Strong,' doesn't have to do with being happy all the time. All people should expect to feel anxious sometimes, because overcoming adversity makes people stronger and brings them together.

The five were killed Thursday in the coastal town of Mpeketoni as they tried to escape Kenyan forces, the ministry said Friday. Authorities detained additional suspects in the raid, including the owner and driver of a vehicle used in the attack on soccer viewers that killed at least 48 people, said national police chief David Kimaiyo. Another suspect, who was operating social media accounts allegedly used by Al-Shabaab, was also arrested, he said. Kenyan authorities aggressively looked for suspects in Sunday's attack on the soccer viewers in the same town. Armed men stormed the city center, shooting and hacking people to death before moving into a residential area, where they went from door to door, the witnesses said. Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group active in Somalia, was not responsible, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said earlier this week. Instead, he blamed local political networks. ""The attack was well planned, orchestrated and politically motivated ethnic violence against the Kenyan community with the intention of victimization for political reasons. This therefore was not an Al-Shabaab terrorist attack,"" Kenyatta said. The heavily armed gunmen, many in military uniforms, attacked hotels, a restaurant, gas station, bank, police station and a government office, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. Video from the scene showed burned-out vehicles and walls pockmarked by bullets. Mpeketoni sits to the west of the Kenya-Somalia border, where the Kenyan army is fighting troops loyal to the al Qaeda-linked militant group. The attack in Mpeketoni is the deadliest attack in Kenya since Al-Shabab militants stormed Nairobi's Westgate Mall last year, killing dozens.

His car was picked up and dropped off at the airport after he says he was told it would be kept in a secure area. He said: 'I was horrified when it showed where my car had been kept while I was on holiday. 'My car had been stored in a field where there is no security fence, CCTV or any kind of lighting and also this is clearly visible from the main road.

Extra parking spaces could soon be built at the airport to ease congestion – and cater for growing passenger numbers. Airport chiefs have applied to build a 9,000-space car park on fields in Wythenshawe. The controversial plan has sparked fury from residents who say it will destroy dwindling greenbelt land – and prompt passengers to park on their roads to save money before boarding a shuttle bus. The low fences in the car park do not appear to be secured, and the cars were parked in lines surrounded by puddles and mud His car was picked up and dropped off at Manchester Airport (pictured) after he says he was told it would be kept in a secure area The airport has eight public car parks with 15,595 spaces and eight staff car parks with 5,535 spaces – but a 3,110 space car park closed in 2010. The 24-hour car park is earmarked for the Styal Road, Ringway Road and Shadowmoss Road area which is to the north-east of the site. It is part of the airport’s overall development of the site, which will include the removal of a 3,000-space car park to make way for Airport City. The plans are due to be discussed at a planning meeting tomorrow and councillors will undertake a visit to the proposed car park site."

Anthony Glees, the Professor of Politics at Buckingham University, called for West African students to be held in their home countries until they have been declared clear of ebola and the 21-day incubation period has passed. His comments came as Sierra Leone announced that it was introducing a four-day ‘lockdown’ to try to prevent the out-of-control epidemic from spreading further. People in the west African country will not be allowed to leave their homes from September 18 to 21. Scroll down for video High level isolation apparatus in the High Secure Infectious Disease Unit at The Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead The disease spreads through contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or contaminated environments and has killed more than 2,100 in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria in recent months. Symptoms include fever, bleeding and damage to the central nervous system, and the current outbreak has a mortality rate of 55 per cent. Professor Glees accused the Government and universities of ‘extreme complacency’ over the issue. ‘This plague is on the rampage,’ he said. ‘What no one seems to realise is that we are potentially at grave risk from any one of the 21,000 students from West African states who are going to arrive in the UK over the next fortnight. Ebola under the microscope - students from affected countries could develop symptoms up to three weeks after arrival ‘Students from affected countries could develop symptoms up to three weeks after arrival. Even where they have been screened before departing they may be sick. We should consider preventing them coming to the UK for 21 days so we can be sure they are not sick.’ He suggested that ‘cash-strapped’ universities regarding overseas students as ‘a vital source of income’ were turning a blind eye to the risk. Last month Universities UK, the membership organisation for the country’s 136 universities, passed on to universities the government’s official advice saying that the Ebola risk to the UK remains ‘very low’. Aerial view of an area of Freetown, Sierra Leone If a suspected case emerged, the patient should be immediately isolated – and looked after by staff equipped with ‘surgical gloves, plastic aprons, plastic visors and surgical facemasks’. But Professor Glees said: ‘No university has this kind of kit to hand unless they have medical schools. Many universities are in smaller towns and do not have the facilities of larger cities such as London. Students are not only obliged to share toilet and shower facilities, but exchanging bodily fluids is something they do with great frequency. ‘I am appalled by the total lack of practical advice, training or equipment for those working in universities who may come into contact with infected students.’ However, last night Dr Ben Neuman, a virology expert at Reading University who teaches students from West Africa, said: ‘The screening system at airports means that the numbers of infected patients potentially reaching the UK is tiny. Universities who think they have a case on their hands would refer it immediately to hospital.’"

A grandmother and four children died in the blaze on Thursday morning, which four other family members managed to escape. The mayor of South Plainfield said a fire service investigation had determined that the house's smoke alarms were not working properly. However, the family's landlord has insisted he installed proper file alarms and they were working when he last checked them in October. Tragic: Tyler Davis, seven, and a boy believed to be his brother Elijah Taylor, were among the five people who died in the raging house fire in South Plainfield, New Jersey Perished: Their sister, Alizae, 12, was also killed into the two-family home when the blaze erupted in the early hours of this morning Grandmother: Ann Jefferson, 62, was also trapped inside, with no way for firefighters to reach her Ann Jefferson, 62, and her grandchildren, 12-year-old Alizae, seven-year-old Tyler Davis, two-year-old Elijah Taylor, and a boy, Chris, believed to be age five or six, perished in the blaze. Another baby girl, two-year-old Angel Taylor, was reportedly saved when her teenage brother ran out of the burning home carrying her in his arms. Fifteen-year-old Shaquan Phillips apparently tried to return inside to rescue other family members, but was stopped by firefighters. A neighbour said he heard the teenager desperately shouting 'Come out, come out, get out of the house!' after the fire broke out. Jordan Taylor, eight, was said to be in critical condition in a hospital's burns unit after escaping the house with his mother, Natalie Jefferson, but the other three survivors have now left hospital. Burnt out: A fire at this house in South Plainfield, New Jersey killed five members of the family Destruction: The 130-year-old converted farmhouse was heavily damaged by the fatal blaze Aftermath: Four other family members survived the fire, but an eight-year-old boy is in a critical condition Raging: The fire was so extensive that emergency services had serious difficulty entering the house The fire started at 3am on Thursday in the converted farmhouse, which is designed to hold two families. When firefighters arrived at the scene, they had serious difficulty gaining entry either to the first or second floor because of the extraordinary volume of flames and smoke. 'There was just so much heat and fire,' South Plainfield's deputy fire chief told the Star-Ledger. Neighbour Isabel Scavino said her husband woke up to the sound of a screaming child, and the couple then heard what sounded like either gunshots or firecrackers. Ms Scavino said she saw a woman running from the home with several children, and a small child in her arms. 'The fire just spread out, it was just crazy. It looked like it started on the first floor and then just spread up to the roof in about a minute,' she said. Response: A teenager's attempts to save his siblings were barred by firefighters while the fire raged Scene: The large house was apparently designed to hold two families Authorities said that there were five casualties, all found on the second floor of the house, but were unable to confirm their identities. However, a relative of the family told the Star-Ledger that the woman killed was 62-year-old Ann Jefferson, and the four children - aged two to 11 - were her grandchildren. One firefighter described his colleagues' agony at being unable to rescue the five victims, saying: 'It’s a very trying time.' Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce Kaplan said authorities were working to confirm the identities of the victims and the causes of death. He said police and the prosecutor's office were investigating the cause of the fire. Two volunteer firefighters received minor injuries when they were involved in a two-vehicle crash en route to the fire."

Sabi Sand -- South Africa's oldest private game reserve -- is now spending half of its annual maintenance budget on security to protect the endangered rhino. Sabi Sand conservationist Andrew Parker told CNN that defense costs could become ""unaffordable."" ""There's no question we're fighting a counter insurgency war here,"" he said. ""As much as we increase the risk, all it will do is it will drive up the price of the horns, it will raise the stakes, the poachers will become more organized and better prepared to fight."" It's a problem across South Africa, but despite investment and innovation, unmanned drones, sniffer dogs and increased security have all failed to halt the rising tide of rhino slaughters, as poachers hunt the herbivores for their horns. Read this: Drone ranger -- unmanned plane to spy on rhino poachers Decimated by illegal poaching, the endangered rhino has increasingly come under attack in recent years. In South Africa alone, the government is estimating 1,000 killings for 2013, while last year there were 668 slaughters. But poaching rhino horn is a lucrative industry with much of the loot sold on to the affluent classes in Asia, particularly China and Vietnam, where it is believed by some that the horns can cure cancer and boost virility. With a kilogram fetching up to $20,000, a single horn weighs around 10kg, according to a report by Moses Montesh, a professor in criminology at the University of South Africa. However, exact prices are hard to measure with some saying a kilogram is more valuable than gold by weight. Montesh told CNN that some of the crime syndicates, getting rich off their relentless poaching, even include former army and police officers. He said: ""In some instances evidence suggests that private game operators are involved in rhino poaching. These guys are very familiar with all military and poaching techniques."" Montesh suggested that the South African armed forces could have a role to play in deterring poachers. He added: ""Currently our defense force is not involved in any military operation. I think this is an opportunity to keep our army active. The use of military drones can be handy."" Read this: Boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts But Julian Rademayer, author of ""Killing for Profit,"" told CNN the crime syndicates, based in Mozambique and operating across the border in South Africa, are out of reach of the authorities. ""You've got two levels, the syndicate crime that is untouchable,"" he said, ""and then you've got poachers being recruited in very impoverished communities in Mozambique and they're cannon fodder to the syndicates."" With poaching operations growing ever more sophisticated, the South African government has considered a radically different approach. In July, the government, led by President Jacob Zuma, openly backed a plan for a legal one-off sale of part of its billion-dollar stockpile of rhino horns in an effort to cripple the market. The government's thinking was that it could flood the market by selling stockpiled horn and regulating trade. The move, advocates say, would send the current sky-high prices tumbling, thus remove the incentives for poaching, and ultimately help prevent further mass killings of the species. But Kelvin Alie, director of wildlife crime and consumer awareness at the International Fund for Animal Awareness, told CNN legalizing the rhino horn trade could be ""disastrous."" ""A failed experiment such as this could result in the decimation of rhino populations,"" Alie said. ""We should not even consider talking about satisfying demand, and especially not about flooding markets, when we have no idea of what demand is, particularly given recent rises in consumption."" Alie called on governments to make illegal rhino horn trading a priority in order to protect the animal. He added: ""An integrated enforcement strategy among police, wildlife, military, judges and custom officials is needed to effectively combat the trade."" Brent Swails contributed to this report."

CNN's ""World's Untold Stories"" examines the dwindling Greek Orthodox community in Turkey and how they are faring. There has been a patriarch in Constantinople for 14 centuries, ever since it was the capital of Byzantium and the Eastern Roman Empire, ruling over the Eastern Mediterranean and much of the Middle East. To this day, Orthodox Christians around the world recite prayers to the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the ""first among equals."" Some describe him as the equivalent of the ""pope"" for the world's Orthodox Christians. But Bartholomew, who is now 70, may become the last in a line of some 270 bishops in Constantinople. The Turkish government refuses to recognize Bartholomew's title as ""Ecumenical Patriarch."" Twenty-five years ago, the Turkish government shut the seminary where Greek Orthodox clergy traditionally trained. Greeks who do not hold Turkish passports are barred from becoming clerics. Instead of being the spiritual leader of his faith, Bartholomew has become a symbol of the dwindling community of ethnic Greeks still living in modern-day Istanbul. There are only around 2,000 ethnic Greeks left in Istanbul. The last members of this community are gradually dying out, but they cling tenaciously to the churches and schools their ancestors built in what was once the capital of a Greek empire.

Critics said the lavish expenditures seemed out of place for a meeting that will focus on recovering from the global economic crisis. But cabinet members defended the Canadian government's plans as they faced shouts and heckles.

Police deployed the drone, ordinarily used to track down and assassinate terrorists and militants in countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan, following a stand-off between officers and farmer Rodney Brossart, who has now been jailed for six months. Brossart was initially accused - and subsequently cleared - of stealing six cows worth $6,000 (£3,625) from a neighbour. But the drone was used when he refused to allow officers on to his 3,600-acre farm in Lakota, North Dakota - despite them having a warrant. When police went to collect the lost cattle in the summer of 2011, three of Brossart's sons - Alex, Jacob and Thomas - allegedly confronted Nelson County Sheriff Kelly Janke with rifles and shotguns. That's when the sheriff summoned a $154 million MQ-9 Predator B drone from nearby Grand Forks Air Force Base, where it was patrolling the US-Canada border for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Using a handheld device that picked up the video camera footage from the spy plane, Sheriff Janke was able to watch the movements of everyone on the farm. During a 16-hour standoff, the sheriff and his deputies waited until they could see the remaining Brossarts put down their weapons. Brossart got a three-year sentence – all but six months of it suspended – for refusing to allow officers on to his land to investigate the cattle theft complaint, according to Fox News. Meanwhile, charges were dropped against Brossart’s wife and daughter for their alleged involvement. Charges against his three sons are still pending.

But the exercise did obtain enough evidence for Brossart and four family members to be arrested ion terrorising charges in November 2011.

The plodding storm had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph -- down considerably from earlier -- as it headed 7 mph in an east-northeasterly direction. Yet while it winds have died down, Lee remained a threat as it moved toward the Appalachians and points to the east and north, with its intense rains producing potential problems especially in already saturated areas. By Sunday night, state and local officials -- plus the Facebook page for Louisiana's emergency management division and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu -- had reported flooding in numerous Louisiana parishes including Iberia, Terrebone, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Tammany and Jefferson. Mississippi also was hard hit. A news release Sunday from its emergency management agency pointed to several flooded roads and damaged homes in Hancock, Harrison, Jackson and Stone counties. And the website for Entergy, a major utility in the area, showed mostly pockets of power outages as far west as the Houston suburbs and as far north as Arkansas. Centered over southern Louisiana, the storm continued to pump out rain -- as much as 20 inches expected in spots through Monday night, according to the National Hurricane Center -- as it chugged northward Sunday toward the Tennessee Valley. In an advisory, the center warned, ""These rains are expected to cause extensive flooding."" The storm had caused numerous headaches, but not the devastation of last week's Hurricane Irene, which killed more than 40 people and left millions without power. Nor has it compared with Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,000 people in Louisiana, Mississippi and other Gulf states six years ago. Robert Green was one of those directly affected by Katrina, which killed his mother and granddaughter and caused much of his house to literally float away. On Sunday, the resident of New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward tracked the storm and prepared for the worst. ""We're making sure that we keep up with what's going on with the storm, so that what happened in 2005 doesn't happen again,"" he said. ""If you live in fear, you don't live as well ... And you realize that you just have to be prepared and listen and move if you need to move."" In a press conference in New Orleans on Sunday afternoon, Landrieu characterized Lee as a ""very stubborn, persistent, slow-moving unpredictable event."" He noted that the storm, by then, had dumped 10 to 13 inches of rain on the city and brought wind gusts of up to 50 mph that caused minor flooding and prompted 60 calls to authorities for downed trees. Yet New Orleans is otherwise fully functional, with all 24 pump stations in the city ""100% operational"" and just more than 200 people without power, down significantly from Saturday, the mayor said. The mayor, though, warned residents not to be complacent, especially with continued tornado threats and rain bands that could dump between 2 to 4 inches at a time and cause flash floods. ""We're not out of the woods yet,"" Landrieu said. Other Gulf coast communities, however, have experienced more severe flooding. That includes the city of Mandeville, across Lake Pontchartrain, which was buried Sunday beneath feet of water. ""Normally there is a street here,"" said Gerard Braud, who sent CNN iReport videos from flooded areas of the city Sunday.  Mailboxes were barely sticking out over the water. In Plaquemines Parish, water pored over the top of levees and flooded parts of Highway 23, prompting its closure, the parish said in a news release. Rapidly rising waters also trapped some cattle, which survived after being steered to higher ground. Coastal residents knew the storm was coming, and many took precautions. ""We are a sturdy people. All Gulf Coasters are willing and able to weather any storm,"" said Andrew Kaile of Metairie, Louisiana, just west of New Orleans, in an iReport Saturday. In its 10 p.m. CT Sunday advisory, the National Hurricane Center reported that Lee's center was expected to move across southern Mississippi overnight and Monday. ""Little change in strength is expected in the next day or so as Lee becomes an extra-tropical cyclone,"" the center added. Over time, it is expected to dump considerable rain in the eastern part of the country -- including New Jersey, New York and Vermont, where grounds are drenched and rivers are already full after Irene. The hurricane center noted Sunday night that ""flooding rains (are) expected to spread from the Gulf Coast to the Appalachians."" ""It will ... be a long, slow trip through the Southeast into the Appalachians,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""Heavy rain and inland flooding continue to be the greatest concern."" Lee ""is expected to connect with a cold front moving through the Great Lakes today,"" Jeras said Sunday.  ""This will bring rain up and down the Eastern seaboard on Monday and will cause heavy travel delays for most major metropolitan areas on the Labor Day holiday.  In addition, the cold front will bring 1 to 3 inches of rain to the already flood-weary Northeast, including Vermont and New York, that were hit hard by (Hurricane) Irene."" After being in effect for days, all tropical storm warnings for the Gulf Coast were discontinued Sunday night. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal had urged state residents Saturday to ""use extreme caution.""  He noted that some roads were already flooded. Ten parishes issued emergency declarations and called on residents to pay attention to weather advisories and flood warnings. In Alabama, officials shut the Port of Mobile due to rough seas. By Sunday afternoon, water levels were as high as 2 to 4 feet above ground level over parts of the Louisiana coast, and up to 3 feet above ground level along the Mississippi and Alabama coasts, the hurricane center said. A storm surge of more than 2 feet was recorded just south of Morgan City, Louisiana, at Amerada Pass, the center said. The storm forced oil and gas producers to halt operations in the region amid threats of flooding in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Some energy producers evacuated employees ahead of the storm.

The tax would yield about 86 million euros per year. The revenue would help cultural industries create French content such as music, images and videos. Possible tax hike; France's President Francois Hollande today looked at proposals for a one per cent tax on smartphones and tablets The proposal is part of France's 'cultural exception,' a policy that protects French cinema and music industries, and other creative sectors, against foreign - often American - competition. The French government will meet leading figures of the cultural sector in the next few weeks before any decision is made. Today also marked Hollande's first day of consultations with trade union leaders and employers on an overhaul of France's pension system, a reform seen as vital to sorting out French public finances. The European Commission has given Paris a further two years to reduce its public deficit to a targeted three per cent of output but wants France to commit to structural reforms in return. Hollande has made a pension revamp a top priority this year but, with his ratings already at record lows, is also eager to avoid a repeat of mass street protests in 2010 when predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy raised the retirement age to 62 from 60. France's President Francois Hollande, left, shakes hand with French businessman and journalist Pierre Lescure after receiving a report about cultural politics in the digital period at the Elysee presidential Palace today The government is due to consult employers and trade unions through to parliament's summer recess. However it will not give them a say in a draft law due in the second half of the year as it did with new labour market rules agreed in January. France will see a 20 billion euros ($26 billion) annual shortfall in its pension system by 2020 if it does not act. The government has ruled out raising the legal retirement age beyond 62, but Hollande has said that extending the pay-in period beyond the current 41.5 years is all but inevitable. Two other options include raising the level of contributions to the retirement system and paring down pay-outs by limiting how much pensions are adjusted for inflation. The head of the Medef employers lobby, Laurence Parisot, called for the pay-in period to be raised to 43 years by 2020 and for the retirement age to be lifted to 65 years from 2040. The moderate CFDT union, which was a key backer of the labour reform, said on Monday it could back a deep overhaul as long as it considered fair. The hardline CGT and FO unions oppose raising either the retirement age or the pay-in period. A recent poll showed, however, that nearly two thirds of French would support a reform raising the retirement age and 66 percent think the pay-in period should be raised."

Officials will reassess the situation at midnight Sunday (8 p.m. EDT), she added.

Last year, another Icelandic eruption, of the volcano Eyjafjallajokull, attracted worldwide attention after its ash cloud disrupted air travel across Europe. Weather patterns this weekend have been very different from the northerly winds that swept through the region after last year's eruption, a spokeswoman for the official United Kingdom weather agency said. But she said the ash cloud's movement is difficult to predict. Ash could reach the United Kingdom and northern continental Europe Wednesday, she said. The Grimsvotn volcano under the Vatnajokull glacier erupted Saturday, according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office. A dark cloud of smoke rose from the glacier, and scientists flew over the scene to evaluate the event, according to CNN affiliate TV2 Iceland. The last eruption of the volcano was in 2004, TV2 Iceland reported. ""It is important for people to know that not all of Iceland is covered in ash,"" Gudmunsdottir said. Sitrun Kapitola, manager of the Islandia Hotel Nupar, which is close to Saturday's eruption, said she could see a cloud of smoke over the mountains, and ash was falling around the hotel. Police were telling her and others that there was no need to evacuate and there was nothing to fear, Kapitola said. ""We see it very well,"" she said. Tourists at the hotel were excited to see the eruption, watching the events unfold while eating dinner, she said. ""It happens every 10 years,"" she said. ""It mostly produces water.""

One holiday park owner in Devon criticised meteorologists for 'trying to cover all eventualities' to avoid a repeat of the infamous 1987 hurricane blooper by Michael Fish. Another, who runs resorts in Suffolk, said staycationers were 'terrified' to come to his sites because of fears their caravans would be left 'bobbing around' on flood water. 'Alarmist': Seaside resorts have accused BBC forecasters of driving away tourists with overly negative predictions, but in some areas such as Bracklesham Caravan Park (pictured) in West Sussex they have proved accurate Angry: One resort owner in Suffolk said meteorologists were tarnishing the whole country with a 'single wet weather symbol' by making it seem like floods such as this one in a Welsh caravan park would affect all tourist hotspots They are now asking for weathermen to not tarnish the whole country with a 'single wet-weather symbol' and be 'more careful with their phrasing'. Claire Jeavons, who runs the Beverley Park holiday site in Paignton, Devon, said 'alarmist' forecasts, which often proved groundless, were having a major impact on bookings across the West Country. She said: 'It is already causing holiday-makers to stay away. Just a few days ago we were hearing that all caravan parks in the West Country were on flood alert and this simply wasn't the case. 'We've been receiving many calls from worried customers, but we assure them that flooding at our altitude would also mean the entire English Riviera was hundreds of feet underwater.' 'Trying to cover all eventualities': Waves crash into Porthcawl lighthouse during a storm. Forecasters have been accused of over-egging reports to ensure they don't end up with another 'Michael Fish' incident Tony Clish, director of Park Holidays UK, which has more than 700 caravans at Felixstowe Beach Holiday Park and Suffolk Sands Holiday Park, said: 'Just last week we were told that all caravan parks in southern England were on flood alert and this simply wasn't the case. 'Some parks in Wales did flood recently, but that's no reason to suggest that caravans in Suffolk would soon be bobbing around on parks which have never flooded before.' He added: 'Coastal holiday parks in Suffolk often stay dry when it is raining inland, yet forecasters frequently tarnish the whole county with a single wet-weather symbol.' BBC weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker said there was no reason why forecasters would want to 'dampen the sprits or be deliberately pessimistic.' 'Our job to focus of negatives': BBC weather presenter Tomasz Schafernaker said forecasters needed to warn people of any dangers Mr Schafernaker, who predicts the weather on BBC South East Today, said: 'I understand the frustration and there is a tendency for weather forecasters to emphasise on the negative aspects of the weather. 'It's just that our job is to pick out the most important parts of the weather which can affect people's lives. 'If indeed there's going to be a shower somewhere we need to flag up that possibility.' In 1987, Mr Fish drew stinging criticism when he flatly denied a viewer's claim that a hurricane was about to hit Britain just hours before the Great Storm caused devastation across the country."

Internet users believe that a quirk of feline psychology means they will sit in circles because they identify it as new territory that requires protecting. It’s well known that cats enjoy the safety of enclosed spaces - such as boxes, carrier bags or cupboards A group of cat owners claims to have found a foolproof way to get cats to do their bidding: simply by drawing a circle on the floor. The cat, they say, instinctively feels compelled to go and sit inside it. According to the theory, cats find circles or similar shapes on the ground irresistible. So if you mark one out - around 2ft (0.6 metres) across -  using chalk, string, masking tape or flex, a cat will enter the circle and refuse to leave. The reason behind this phenomenon, however, is unknown. It’s well known that cats enjoy the safety of enclosed spaces - such as boxes, carrier bags or cupboards - and equally like perching on high spots where they can keep an eye on the world. It’s also established that they have favourite spots in the home. Animal behaviour expert Professor Daniel Mills told MailOnline cats could be attracted to circles if they formed a barrier, for instance, if they were made of a curled-up draught excluder, tea towels or a row of socks. ‘Low barriers can give a cat a sense of security because the cat can cower down,’ says the Lincoln University academic. ‘If you take a cat to the vet and it is put in an unfamiliar cage, it will often sit in a litter tray if there is one inside the cage. ‘The probable reason is that the sides of the tray are raised and they can get their eyes below the level. They don’t realise that their ears are sticking up.’ That could explain the lure of a raised circle, but not a two- dimensional mark on the floor. Artificial scents are typically used in the litter to counteract these smells, and silica gels are also included to absorb urine. Calcium bentonite is added to create what the video calls ‘litter clump’, which, as the name suggests, it clumps faeces together to make it easier to find and remove from the tray. And when it comes to marking their territory, glands in a cat’s face, tails, paws and lower back are used to rub against objects. This is also used to establish and feel familiarity with objects in the home. For example, when cats rub up against a person, they are showing affection while telling other cats that the person belongs to them. The video is part of a series, created by ACS, called Reactions.

But it was weather that destroyed the beloved mainstays as Superstorm Sandy’s savage winds ripped through low-lying coastal areas, rendering them to all but splinters. Nostalgia aside, boardwalks prove to be a driving economic force for these shoreline communities like the Rockaways and the Jersey Shore, and now, those communities are scrambling to rebuild their boardwalks before the busy summer months. Scroll down for video Total destruction: A photo taken on Halloween following Superstorm Sandy shows the immense damage to the amusement park in Seaside Heights, New Jersey Gone: A photo from November 1 shows teens on the beach at Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey, next to pilings that used to support part of a boardwalk; authorities are now looking at other sturdier materials Rush: On November 1, a worker removes damaged boards from the Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey, boardwalk; coastal communities are racing to rebuild their boardwalks in time for next summer In Far Rockaway, more than 500 residents from around the area showed up for a rally yesterday to demand federal support for rebuilding boardwalks and replenishing sand on the beaches, Rockaway’s The Wave newspaper reported. The destroyed boardwalk in Long Beach in Long Island will cost an estimated $25million to repair. Likewise, the terminal and boathouse in Ocean Beach could cost as much as $1million to rebuild, according to Newsday. Those in stricken communities will need the tourism money this summer more than ever as they try to rebuild homes and other infrastructure. The expensive efforts are forcing decisions not only about how much to spend, but also whether to rebuild with environmentally sensitive wood or more durable materials. The destruction of late October's Superstorm Sandy will likely result in some changes along the shoreline, with more wooden walkways giving way to concrete or synthetic materials. 'Under the Polymerwalk' might not have the same ring to it as The Drifters' 1960s hit 'Under The Boardwalk,' but in some places there will no longer be boards in the boardwalk. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has decided wooden boardwalks simply can't cut it anymore. City parks officials say concrete sections of boardwalk in Queens' Rockaways and Brooklyn's Coney Island held up much better in the storm. Desolation: Seagulls screech on the boardwalk in Ocean Grove, New Jersey; the boardwalk was warped and cracked by Superstorm Sandy Synthetic strength? A section of the Spring Lake, New Jersey boardwalk ripped loose during Superstorm Sandy, despite being made of out synthetic material And the mayor has long wanted to move away from the tropical hardwoods, harvested from endangered rainforests, that were used to build many boardwalks. That is an issue Tim Keating, director of Rainforest Relief, has been working on for years. He says coastal communities will be under pressure to quickly rebuild but urges them to resist the temptation to use tropical rainforest wood such as ipe, which is cheaper than synthetic materials and popular for its durability. Belmar is considering ipe for its boardwalk reconstruction. Keating says durable synthetic materials are the best choice for boardwalks; Belmar, Spring Lake, Point Pleasant Beach and other places already used it. Wooden boardwalks have staunch defenders, who say nothing else looks, feels or even smells quite like a true wooden boardwalk. A group from Coney Island called Friends of the Boardwalk sued last year to block a New York City plan to replace wooden boardwalks with concrete and plastic. Todd Dobrin, the group's leader, isn't convinced concrete will withstand a storm any better than wood. 'When hurricanes come through, they don't ask whether it's concrete or wood,' he said. 'They destroy whatever is in their path.' The destruction in Seaside Heights has become emblematic of the storm because of a roller coaster that plunged into the ocean. Yet Sandy also destroyed the boardwalk where families eat belly-busting foods like zeppoles — fried dough laden with powdered sugar — and where Snooki and company partied their way through the MTV reality show 'Jersey Shore.’ Month later: Sand and rubble sit where the boardwalk used to be in Seaside Heights, New Jersey on November 29 Mayor Bill Akers said 75 percent of his town's budget comes from tourism, with the remaining 25 percent raised from local taxpayers. 'You can see how important it is for us to get the boardwalk back up and running, and to make sure we have a summer season,' he told the Associated Press. 'It's something we have to get done.' Seaside Heights, like several other Jersey shore towns, is soliciting bids to rebuild its boardwalk; Akers estimated it will take $10 million to $12 million. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will reimburse towns for 75 percent of those costs, but local governments first must front all the money themselves, forcing many to borrow in the short or long term. In these towns, even in the many non-commercial sections where boardwalks are merely a non-sandy way to get from here to there, not having one is not an option. To the north, Belmar has approved the largest boardwalk rebuilding project so far in the aftermath of the storm, committing $20 million to rebuild its 1.3-mile boardwalk and haul away the remnants of the old one. It is also considering erecting a steel sea wall to be buried under sand dunes to help protect the boardwalk and homes and businesses. 'The beach and the boardwalk go together,' said Mayor Matthew Doherty. 'It's who we are; it's part of our identity.' Yet identity only goes so far in shore towns' calculus. Money is a bigger factor. 'If there's no boardwalk, people aren't going to come this summer,' Doherty said. 'They'll go somewhere else, and if they like it there, they won't be back here. We want to be the first in the race to get things started for the summer.' Scope: A satellite view of Hurricane Sandy shows the massive scope of the storm A 20-foot chunk of boardwalk is all that remains in Belmar, for one reason. It was an experimental section, bolted to underpinnings with the same hurricane tie-down straps that many home builders use to bind homes to their foundations. The entire new Belmar boardwalk will be built this way, Doherty said.Other Jersey shore towns including Sea Girt, Asbury Park and Point Pleasant Beach are moving forward with boardwalk rebuilding plans; Spring Lake has to rebuild its boardwalk little more than a year after Tropical Storm Irene wrecked half the old one. New York state parks, including the popular Jones Beach, also are starting to rebuild. 'We've engaged a contractor to go in and begin repairing it and experiment with some techniques as they go along,' said Ron Foley, Long Island regional director for the New York state parks. 'The boardwalk damage at Jones Beach was different. The wave action at some places got underneath the boardwalk. They lifted it right up, including the pilings driven into the sand, gave it a roller coaster effect.' Manasquan, New Jersey, for decades has paved its beachfront walkway with asphalt. Yet that, too, gets trashed by major storms. A 1992 nor'easter smashed large sections of it, and Sandy wrecked about half of it."

""I said, 'Oh, no. My God, not again.'"" He was faced with looking for work in an industry that traditionally slows down in the winter months. ""It's more than losing your job. It gives you a feeling of rejection,"" he says. Yet, Nieto feels this is a time to learn valuable lessons, especially for those who need to dip into their savings when unemployment checks don't cover all of the bills. ""I think a lot of people will learn from this situation, and, going forward, they'll try to save more money."" He has been trying to stay healthy, busy and positive. Passing the time working on projects in his basement workshop and taking yoga classes has helped him get through the rough spots, and his luck is turning. He was offered a job that starts in March. ""It is a relief, because I'm employed,"" he says, ""however, I'm taking a job for much less money."" Nieto believes that most employers cannot afford to hire at the salaries they could offer in the past. Like Kenney's hardware store, Sue Stein's American craft gallery, also in Brookline, is not seeing any major shifts in her business, yet. ""Our business has been certainly down, but not devastating,"" she says. Fire Opal, her gallery, sells everything from earrings to pottery to scarves, all made by artists from around the country. To keep her business healthy, she says, she is trying to make adjustments like buying less merchandise. But she is changing her approach to her customers as well. She says she tries to keep ""understanding that people are having a hard time and trying to find things that are more in their price range."" Like Kenney and Nieto, Stein is also trying to stay optimistic. ""I think if we all are very careful,"" she says, ""we'll sort of ride it out and then things will adjust."""

But some of the claims Romney makes in the ad about his own crime-fighting record have raised questions. With the crucial Iowa caucuses a little more than two weeks away, the Romney ad, titled ""Choice: Judgment,"" attempts to contrast his record as Massachusetts governor with Huckabee's in Arkansas. With pictures of the two candidates on the screen, the ad's announcer says that ""Romney got tough on drugs like meth"" and that ""he never pardoned a single criminal.""  Watch Romney's ad attacking Huckabee » The announcer goes on to say Huckabee ""granted 1,033 pardons and commutations, including 12 convicted murderers. Huckabee granted more clemencies than the previous three governors combined. Even reduced penalties for manufacturing methamphetamine."" The announcer closes with ""on crime the difference is judgment."" Speaking to reporters Monday in Los Angeles, California, Huckabee disputed the ad, pointing to his record of carrying out the death penalty while governor as evidence that he was tough on crime. Massachusetts doesn't have the death penalty. ""The difference between us is that I did something he never had to do. I carried out the death penalty 16 times, more than any other governor in my state's history,"" Huckabee said. The statistics cited in Romney's ad come from a recent Associated Press examination of Huckabee's record of commutations and pardons. Huckabee received more commutation and pardon requests than Romney did and rejected 78 percent of them, according to The Washington Post. One commutation request Huckabee rejected as governor was that of convicted rapist Wayne DuMond. But Huckabee supported DuMond's early release, and the convict raped and murdered a woman in Missouri after his 1999 parole. The mother of DuMond's victim has vowed to campaign against Huckabee's candidacy. Romney's claim he ""got tough"" on methamphetamine dealers is questionable since a proposal to stiffen sentences never passed the Massachusetts Legislature. The former Arkansas governor also challenged Romney's assertion that Huckabee had ""reduced"" the punishment for manufacturing meth. ""With Huckabee way ahead among evangelical voters, Romney is doing his best to change the subject to crime and, in an earlier ad, illegal immigration,"" said Howard Kurtz, The Washington Post's media critic and host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" ""Huckabee may have a hard time fighting back. He's got little money for TV, while Romney is spending millions."" The two candidates have been engaged in almost daily skirmishes over their records since Huckabee emerged as the front-runner in Iowa a few weeks ago, a position Romney had held. The Iowa caucuses will be held January 3. Before the disagreement over crime, the two exchanged barbs over foreign policy. In the current issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, Huckabee says, ""American foreign policy needs to change its tone and attitude, open up, and reach out. The Bush administration's arrogant bunker mentality has been counterproductive at home and abroad."" That stance prompted Romney, on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, to call on Huckabee to apologize to President Bush for his remarks. ""I said, 'Well, did this come from Barack Obama or from Hillary Clinton? Did it come from John Edwards?' No, it was Gov. Huckabee,"" Romney told host Tim Russert. ""The truth of the matter is this president has kept us safe these last six years and that has not been easy to do."" Huckabee said he didn't have anything for which to apologize. ""I didn't say the president was arrogant,"" Huckabee told CNN on Sunday. ""One of my opponents has mistakenly, maybe purposefully, misstated my position on that. I've said the policies have been arrogant."" E-mail to a friend"

He added: ""This doesn't mean, however, that the municipality will ban the use of them starting from May. The draft seeks only to regulate."" Despite the denial, Zappalorto said he hoped the furore surrounding reports of restrictions on wheeled luggage would prompt the tourism industry to address the issue of noisy bags. He echoed earlier comments, reported by the local Il Messaggero newspaper, in which he was quoted saying a ban would hopefully inspire luggage manufacturers to introduce softer, air-filled tires. ""This will undoubtedly be a deserving action that will contribute to the preservation of our architectural heritage and to the serenity of residents and tourists themselves,"" he said."

White children now make up 49.7 per cent of the 50million in America’s state schools, down from 63.4 per cent in 1997. There were 29.2million white students in 1997, with this figure dropping to 24.9million in 2014, which still makes them the largest single ethnic group. White children now make up 49.7 per cent of the 50million in America’s state schools The U.S Department of Education predicts that by 2023, the number of white students enrolled in U.S public schools will have decreased to 23.5million, giving them a 45 per cent share of enrolment. The number of Hispanic public school students is projected to increase from 12.9million to 15.6million by 2023, meaning that they will make up 30 per cent of all pupils. In 1997 there were around just six million Hispanic students. The number of Hispanic students is forecast to overtake whites by 2043. The number of black students, meanwhile, has remained about the same at 7.7million since 1997. Their enrollment share is projected to decrease from 16 to 15 percent by 2023. The number of Asian/Pacific Islander students is projected to increase to 2.9 million, and their enrollment share in 2023 is projected to be 5 per cent. This Department of Education graph shows how white and black student numbers have fallen and Hispanic students increased since 2001 The U.S Department of Education predicts that by 2023, the number of white students enrolled in U.S public schools will have decreased to 23.5million, giving them a 45 per cent share of enrolment Despite diversity increasing, segregation in U.S schools is still a major issue – one that President Obama is particularly concerned about. The Civil Right Project at UCLA, using Education Department data, has found that segregation has been increasing since 1990, and that black students nationally are substantially more segregated than they were in 1970. Around the country, only 23 percent of black students attended white-majority schools in 2011. That's the lowest number since 1968 and far below the peak of 44 percent in 1988. And segregation is also affecting Latino students, the largest minority group in the public schools. They now are more likely to attend school with other Latinos than black students are with other blacks. Many advocates blame this on the federal courts for removing school districts from desegregation orders. The changing demographics of the school system -the withdrawal of white students from the public systems and the booming Latino population -also contribute to the changing colors of the schools. Civil rights data recently released by the Education Department showed glaring disparities remain in all aspects of education. Among the findings: minority students are less likely to have access to advanced math and science classes, and to have new teachers. Black students of any age -even preschoolers - are more likely to be suspended. And, there continue to be gaps between the performance on national assessments between whites and black and Hispanic students, with whites scoring higher. In a recent bit of good news, high school graduation rates increased 15 percentage points for Hispanic students and 9 percentage points for African-American students from 2006 to 2012, according to a recent GradNation Report. Hispanic students graduated at 76 percent and African-American students at 68 percent in 2012, the report said. The national rate is 80 percent."

The disastrous year has prompted government and aviation officials from dozens of countries to gather in Montreal this week for an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) assembly to discuss the risks of flying over conflict zones and how to prevent planes from vanishing. Malaysia is leading a push for sweeping changes after its state-owned flag carrier, Malaysia Airlines, suffered two air disasters within five months last year. Malaysia wants mandatory reporting of conflict zone risks after a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down The Southeast Asian country is pushing for real-time aircraft tracking and calling on the UN to force its member states to warn airlines about the risks of flying over conflict zones. One of Malaysia Airlines' planes disappeared and has not been located, and another was shot down over eastern Ukraine, where the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian rebels are still involved in a heavy battle for territory. All 298 passengers and crew were killed when flight MH17 was shot down while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur last July. Since that incident the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has faced pressure to develop new systems to share intelligence and warn airlines about new threats associated with conflict zones. All 298 passengers and crew were killed when flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, director general of Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation, said a proposal to create a central website where states and agencies could voluntarily publish warnings does not go far enough. Speaking at the ICAO assembly, he was quoted by Reuters as saying that reports from ICAO member states should be ‘mandatory and timely’. He added: ‘We cannot delay implementing changes in the way global commercial aviation operates.’ The ICAO’s proposal is backed by the US and Netherlands, which lost 196 citizens when flight MH17 went down. The International Civil Aviation Organization is holding its second high-level safety conference in 70 years The Netherlands also wants airlines to tell passengers before take-off whether their flight will cross a conflict zone. The US said MH17 was hit with a ground-to-air missile fired by rebels, but Russia insists that the aircraft was shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet. It was flying at about 33,000ft after Ukraine had warned airlines to remain above 32,000ft. Malaysia is also pushing for real-time aircraft tracking to become an industry standard, despite the costs. Search teams have found no trace of flight MH370 despite scouring 25,000 square miles of ocean It follows the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which was carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Despite extensive search efforts in the Indian Ocean teams have been unable to find any debris or the plane’s black boxes. In a working paper presented to the assembly, Malaysia said: ‘We believe, based on our unfortunate experience, (it) will be offset by the benefits of enhancing the effectiveness of the alerting and search and rescue services. ‘The disappearance of MH370 demonstrates the crucial need to improve aircraft tracking systems for the sake of safety and security. The ICAO assembly is likely to endorse a plane tracking system that sends signals every 15 minutes ‘In this day and age, the fact that an aeroplane could go missing and that the flight recorders could be so difficult to recover is unacceptable.’ Despite Malaysia’s demands the ICAO conference is likely to back a less-costly system that sends tracking signals every 15 minutes, but would increase the intervals to every minute in an emergency or if a plane deviates from its route. Current standards require long-haul flights over water to report their position about every 45 minutes. Delegates are also studying how ejectable and buoyant black boxes would assist rescuers and investigators when a plane crashes."

Valcke was responding to the criticism of FIFA’s decision that means next year’s women’s World Cup in Canada will not be played on grass. A number of leading women players have filed a legal challenge to the decision to play on third-generation synthetic pitches, and a major part of their argument is that men would not be expected to contest a World Cup on anything other than grass. Gareth Bale playing for Wales against Andorra last month... on artificial turf in a 2-1 win Valcke said FIFA understands that players want 'the best conditions to perform well' but stressed any organiser of any of its tournaments is entitled to propose artificial turf. Valcke insists FIFA would only accept pitches 'of the highest quality', and added: 'It could well be that sooner rather than later the men’s World Cup will also be played on artificial pitches.' He told FIFA’s website that Canada’s decision to offer artificial pitches was 'due to the extreme climate in the host country', a problem that looks set to also arise when the men’s 2022 World Cup is played in Qatar. Valcke added: 'As has already been explained, this is not a question of money, or of differences between men’s and women’s events, but it is a matter of the natural conditions in Canada: we want to guarantee consistent top-level playing conditions for all 24 teams during the event, both in the official stadiums and at the training sites. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke says a men’s World Cup could be played on artificial turf soon 'This has been the sole reason behind the decision to play on artificial turf from day one.' Artificial pitches are not allowed in England’s Premier League and Football League, but the latter may soon give the go-ahead to their reintroduction in League One and League Two, with club chairmen due to vote on November 6. Such surfaces will be permitted at Conference level from next season, and this season a rule change means artificial pitches are allowed at any stage of the FA Cup. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told German magazine Sport Bild the world governing body will listen to all pitch suggestions, saying men could play a World Cup on a synthetic surface 'maybe even tomorrow'. Blatter said: 'We are open to proposal from the local organisers, and this has been possible for years in accordance with the FIFA regulations. Artificial turf is the future of football.' England famously lost to Russia in qualification for Euro 2008 on artificial turf in Moscow"

Mr Johnson, right, has asked his officials to investigate ‘the costs and practicalities’ of running the London scheme, which has so far placed more than 850 plaques on properties across the capital. Senior figures within the Mayor’s Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport believe the idea ‘makes sense’ and are looking at ways he could take over the scheme from English Heritage.

'Uncertain': English Heritage has said it can no longer afford the £250,000 annual cost of running the scheme The plaques cost an average of £965 to install at a time when English Heritage’s budget is dropping from £130 million to £92 million. Plaques that have already been approved are still expected to be installed by a team reduced to two full-time employees.

Suzannah Bertram, 32, and two men tied Lisa Bertram up in a room in a flat in Blackpool, Lancashire, burned her with a gadget used to 'zap' insects, cut her with a knife, cut all her hair cut off, and forced her to swallow a 'noxious substance' along with a cocktail of medication. The incident apparently took place after the group 'took exception' to something 36-year-old Lisa, who has learning difficulties, had said to Bertram. Savage: Suzannah Bertram was jailed along with Derek Buchanan (left) and Fraser Gallagher (right) for torturing her sister-in-law Lisa, who has learning difficulties, over a five day period in August 2012 At one stage Lisa was taken to hospital when her lip ended up partially hanging off and became infected. But after treatment she was allowed back to the flat in Central Drive, Blackpool, Lancashire, when Bertram ordered her to falsely tell medics she had been beaten up in the street. Back at her makeshift cell, she was then subjected to yet more 'cruelty and degradation' before one of the gang made a 999 call when she passed out. Paramedics found Lisa in a 'very dire state' and was said to be 'very incoherent, injured, wrapped in a dirty duvet'. She woke up in hospital and is now recovering from her ordeal. Details of the attack emerged at Burnley Crown Court where Bertram - the mother 'of a number of children' - admitted wounding, false imprisonment, administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon. Fraser Gallagher, 20, from Glasgow was locked up for 42 months and Derek Buchanan, 18, of Blackpool, was given 12 months. The attack took place in a flat on Central Drive in Blackpool, Lancashire. Lisa Bertram had arrived with her husband Kevin only two months earlier and initially stayed with her attacker before moving to a flat upstairs Both admitted false imprisonment, administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon. Earlier Richard Haworth, prosecuting, said the victim was a 'vulnerable young lady, with significant leaning difficulties.' She arrived in Blackpool in June 2012 with her husband Kevin and initially stayed with Bertram before moving to rent the flat upstairs. Mr Haworth added : 'Between August 13 and August 17, 2012, Lisa Bertram was subjected to a prolonged, cruel and degrading attack at the hands, at various times, of the three defendants. 'She sustained physical and emotional harm during the course of that time.' The prosecutor said the attack began after the victim’s husband was admitted to Blackpool Victoria Hospital unbeknown to his wife. She went downstairs in search of him and found Bertram lying asleep on the sofa with two men inside the flat. Mr Haworth said Gallagher then ordered Lisa to the floor by the window and then put the table over her, so it’s legs were by her head at one end and her knees at the other. Heaters were then put either side of her and she was 'tightly encased' in that position. Gallagher then got a yard brush, put it on top of the table and she recalled feeling something wet on her legs. She thought it might be urine. The victim felt tingling in her legs and described what she thought was a 'zappy thing', which turned out to be a prohibited Taser-type device, which had originally been used as an electronic fly swatter. The prosecutor said: 'Clearly, at some stage during the course of that week-long period, she sustained an injury to her mouth, a serious tear to the upper lip. The lip was partially hanging off and became infected.' Brutal: Suzannah Bertram admitted wounding, false imprisonment, administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon at Burnley Crown Court (pictured). She was sentenced to four years in prison Bertram took the victim to hospital where she received stitches but told her sister-in-law to say her injury had been caused by two girls. But Lisa did not go to the Royal Preston Hospital for further treatment as advised. The prosecutor added: 'One cannot say how exactly, or who exactly, caused that injury to the lip. The fact remains it was caused during the time of the false imprisonment.' The prosecutor said when the victim returned to the flat, she was made to go under the table again and one of her legs was tied up to the cord of one of the heaters. He added: 'The following day, as she believed it was, Gallagher zapped her on the arm four times with the taser and cut her hair. Some of her husband’s medication was there and Suzannah Bertram told the complainant to take some.' 'Gallagher made her drink some yellow fluid. Derek Buchanan was present. He was part and parcel of the false imprisonment, administering the noxious substance and tasering. It beggars belief what these defendants were doing to her.' Mr Haworth said at one point Bertram had taken a knife and started to cut downwards on Lisa's arm until the victim passed out. Paramedics were eventually called to a report that Lisa had taken an overdose, only to be horrified when they arrived at the scene. One of the paramedics said. 'She appeared as though she had not been cared for in any way.' In mitigation defence counsel Sharon Watson said: 'It’s impossible to explain what would lead three people to behave in the terrible, despicable way that they did towards Lisa Bertram, a lady who had done absolutely nothing to them. ' 'The best guess is that something was said by Lisa Bertram. Individually, none of the people in the dock would have behaved in the way that they did. 'It would appear together they conducted themselves in a way that was out of character and out of the norm. The incident was dreadful and must have been terrible for Lisa Bertram to endure.' Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said: 'Over several days this incident occurred which led to harm to Lisa Bertram in a most cruel manner. This was a dreadful case.'"

Relatives of Alan Catterall, 54, wept as plastic kayak manufacturer Pyranha Mouldings became one of the first companies in the country to be convicted of the charge following a five week trial. Mr Catterall's widow, Pearl, said: 'I am definitely happy with the verdict and hopefully it is a landmark for other cases like this.' 'But it does not change the fact that Alan is no longer with us and his family miss him desperately. He has missed his son’s wedding and birth of his grandson and will not see his two daughters marry. 'Alan was a hard-working, conscientious man and he gave Pyranha Mouldings everything. It hurts that they have not admitted any failings in their health and safety procedures.' Mr Catterall died after he was trapped inside the industrial oven at the company's factory in Premier Point, Runcorn, Cheshire, on December 23, 2010. The father-of-three from Halewood, Liverpool, had gone inside to clean molten plastic escaping from a mould while the oven was switched off after a fault developed. But when the fault was repaired his colleague Mark Francis turned the power, causing the doors to slam shut and lock from the outside. In a cruel twist, Mr Francis was engaged to Mr Catterall's eldest daughter. During the trial at Liverpool Crown Court Andrew Thomas, QC, prosecuting, said no-one realised Mr Catterall was trapped inside the oven until smoke started seeping out and the 'horrific' circumstances of his death discovered. 'The design of the oven was such that the moment it was switched on the doors automatically shut and coked with metal pins which dropped into place on the outside,' Mr Thomas said. 'Mr Catterall was trapped within the oven. There was no means of escape and no means of raising the alarm.' As the temperature soared, Mr Catterall desperately tried to prise open the oven door with a crowbar but could not do so. His shouts for help were drowned out by the din of the noisy factory. The court heard he died after suffering severe burns and shock. Pyranha Mouldings was found guilty by a majority verdict of 10-2 and unanimously convicted of two health and safety breaches. Technical director Peter Mackereth, 60, of Iso Vivoid, Llangollen, North Wales, was unanimously found guilty of two health and safety breaches. He was responsible for health and safety at the factory. High Court judge, Mr Justice McDuff, adjourned sentence for financial reports and will pass sentence in Leeds at a date to be fixed. The oven where Mr Catterall died: As the temperature soared, Mr Catterall desperately prise open the oven door with a crowbar but could not do so. His shouts for help were drowned out by the din of the noisy factory Mr Catterall grew up in Liverpool and worked at a tyre factory in Speke before joining the Ford factory in Halewood where he worked for many years. He joined Pyranha in 1997 and was promoted to team leader at the company - which had between 90 and 100 employees - where his wife Pearl and daughter also worked. Mackereth said experts helped design the oven where Mr Catterall died, he and maintained he looked at the safety aspects of the design and considered safety in terms of the detailed design. But Martin Heywood, the investigating inspector at the Health and Safety Executive, said, 'The doors were set to automatically close whenever the electrical supply was switched back on, which meant there was a high risk of someone being trapped inside. 'There had been no risk assessments and staff had not received suitable training on how to use the new ovens and there were no written instructions on cleaning and maintenance. 'If Pyranha Mouldings and the individual prosecuted over Alan's death had properly considered the risks to employees when they designed, installed and operated the ovens then he would still be here today.' Detective inspector Gary Smith, from Cheshire Police, welcomed the verdicts. He said, 'Alan’s death was a tragedy.

The ABC reality series dealt with the death of contestant Eric Hill, who perished in a paragliding accident following his stint on the show. Hill was one of 25 bachelors vying for the heart of Andi Dorfman. Dorfman visited the hometowns of the four remaining contestants, but the show took a dramatic turn when host Chris Harrison had to inform the group of Hill's passing. ""I know this is a little unorthodox,"" Harrison said. ""You all know Eric Hill. He, a couple of days ago, was in Utah paragliding and was in a serious accident. We knew he was hurt bad, but we just didn't know how bad. We learned this morning that he passed away. Obviously I'm really sorry to be the one to have to tell you. But as soon as we found out, I definitely wanted every one of you guys to know as fast as we could."" Dorfman broke down in tears and one of the bachelors, Marcus Grodd, had to leave the room. Dorfman was later shown sobbing and lamenting the fact that Hill was eliminated from the show after the pair had a disagreement. ""I kicked him out,"" she said. ""I can't believe that was my last conversation with him."" Dorfman also rallied to help the others deal with the tragedy. ""It just puts in perspective all of this -- there's so much more to all of this,"" she told them. ""There's life, people have lives here."" In his blog about the show for EW, Harrison defended the decision to include the heartbreak in the episode. ""There were those who didn't think we should shoot it at all and not include this news,"" he wrote. ""I vehemently disagreed. I thought we should not only shoot it, but felt we should include it on this show for you to see as well. I knew this was going to be a brutally sad moment for all of us, but that's why I felt so strongly we should show it."""

In the past three over $54million in compensation has been awarded to 25,000 people who were wrongly discriminated against as a result of enforcement actions, Donovan noted.

And as you know, decades ago, these funds were used to support discrimination. Now, they will be used to expand opportunity and bring communities closer to the American Dream.’With half of all African-American household wealth in the U.S. wiped out in the four years before President Barack Obama took office, Donovan said, quoting a Pew Research study, the agency has its work cut out.Donovan, though, remains optimistic, saying ‘we will continue to in order to strengthen this work in the months and years ahead to bring Fair Housing into the 21st century.’"

The consecration of Rev. Gene Robinson as bishop of New Hampshire left many conservatives disaffected. Leaders of the Common Cause Partnership, a network of more than 100,000 Anglican Christians in North America, are expected to unveil a draft constitution for a new ecclesiastical territorial division, or province, at an evening service in Wheaton Evangelical Free Church in Wheaton, Illinois, the group said in a written statement. ""The public release of our draft constitution is an important concrete step toward the goal of a biblical, missionary and united Anglican Church in North America,"" Bishop Robert Duncan of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, diocese, said in the written statement. The move comes after years of debate over issues from the interpretation of the Bible to homosexuality. Tensions reached a boiling point in 2003, when the Episcopal Church consecrated an openly gay man, Rev. Gene Robinson, as bishop of New Hampshire. The move outraged worshippers with traditionalist tendencies, and since then, four dioceses and several parishes have left the Episcopalian Church, including Duncan's Pittsburgh diocese. In all, the newly formed division will consist of about 100,000 members from the secessionist dioceses and parishes, along with splinter groups that had left the Episcopalian Church in earlier years, said Robert Lundy, a spokesman for the group ""This constitution brings them back together under one church, all aligned together,"" Lundy said. ""This is all these folks coming back together."" Lunday said it was safe to say Duncan will lead the nascent province. An assembly is likely to be called next year to determine additional leadership, he said. The Rev. Dr. Charles K. Robertson, canon to the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Katharine Jefferts Schori, issued a statement saying it would not hazard a guess as to the consequences of Wednesday's service. ""We will not predict what will or will not come out of this meeting, but simply continue to be clear that the Episcopal Church, along with the Anglican Church of Canada and the La Iglesia Anglicana de Mexico, comprise the official, recognized presence of the Anglican Communion in North America,"" he said. ""We reiterate what has been true of Anglicanism for centuries: that there is room within the Episcopal Church for people with different views, and we regret that some have felt the need to depart from the diversity of our common life in Christ."" The Episcopal Church is part of the Anglican Communion, which is composed of 38 provinces around the world. It was not immediately clear which of the other provinces would recognize the Anglican Church in North America, but Lundy said in a meeting last year in Jerusalem indicated that some would do so. Lundy said the draft constitution will state the province's core beliefs and doctrine. He said it will not lay out definite policies for issues the leaders disagree on, such as ordaining women."

Jim Morrison had been performing with the band at a typically raucous concert at Miami's Key Auditorium on March 1, 1969 when the incident took place. Reportedly drunk and slurring obscenities at the crowd, he was accused of unzipping his pants and simulating a sex act, a charge he denied. Despite being acquitted of lascivious behavior and drunkenness, Morrison was convicted of indecent exposure and open profanity and sentenced to six months in jail. He was still appealing the verdict in 1971 when he died in Paris at the age of 27. Four decades on and the outgoing Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, has said he may consider an official let-off for the legendary hell-raiser. ""It's something that I haven't given a lot of thought to, but it's something I'm willing to look into in the time I have left,"" Crist told U.S. Congressional newspaper The Hill. ""Anything is possible. Stay tuned."" Doors fans have long appealed for an official pardon for Morrison, petitioning previous Florida governors without success. Many argue that the trial was a sham and that there was no conclusive evidence supporting the exposure charge against Morrison. Crist was first approached about the issue of clemency in 2007. According to The Hill, he said he would consider it, acknowledging ""there was some doubt about how solid the case was."" But with Crist set to leave office in January after losing his bid for the Senate in the recent Midterm elections, time is running out for Morrison's supporters as the request must be submitted by December 9. Under state law a pardon must have the consent of the governor and at least two other members of the Florida Board of Executive Clemency. The Doors formed in Los Angeles in 1965 and comprised of Morrison on lead vocals, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore."

That followed an incident in qualifying when Rosberg brought out the yellow flags, thwarting Hamilton in his bid to claim pole at a time when he was on a quicker lap than the German. VIDEO Scroll down to ride on board with Lewis Hamilton for a lap of the Monaco GP Condemned: Lewis Hamilton has had his behaviour at Monaco criticised by many in F1 Wrongdoing: Hamilton refused to acknowledge his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg on the podium Starting from top spot on the grid proved crucial for Rosberg as he went on to win from lights to flag and return to the top of the drivers' standings, leaving Hamilton to settle for second. Hamilton, though, did not disguise his displeasure at the antics of Rosberg, even though the 28-year-old was cleared by the stewards. Mercedes non-executive chairman and three-times champion Niki Lauda chastised Hamilton after the race, suggesting that ignoring Rosberg was 'not good' and reflected badly on the Mercedes brand. Now John Surtees and Mika Hakkinen have waded into the debate and agree with Lauda that Hamilton's behaviour was unbecoming. Surtees, the only driver to win world titles on two and four wheels, said in his column in Motor Sport magazine: 'I have no doubt about Lewis Hamilton's driving ability, but I didn't like what I saw and heard from Monaco. 'I can understand the frustration Lewis must have felt in not having that opportunity on the last lap of qualifying to get pole. 'But I think his reaction to his team-mate and team was wrong.' Hakkinen, who won two titles with McLaren in 1998 and 1999, believes Hamilton displayed the attitude of a sore loser. In his column for Hermes, Hakkinen said: 'It's hard to tell if something is going to change significantly (between the drivers). 'I don't know if Lewis would even consider apologising for his behaviour. It is a very individual thing. 'But in my opinion, one of the characteristics of a good winner is he also knows how to lose.' Unimpressed: Former world champion Mika Hakkinen believes Hamilton displayed the attitude of a poor loser Wrong: And John Surtees (left) was equally unimpressed with the attitude of Hamilton at Monaco Surtees, now 80, believes Hamilton was also wrong to highlight his upbringing as a source of motivation compared to that of Rosberg. Hamilton suggested he was hungrier than Rosberg as he was raised on a council estate in Stevenage, whereas the German lived the life of luxury in Monaco. Although Hamilton later claimed the quote was taken out of context, Surtees feels it has only added fuel to the fire for Rosberg. 'Lewis had said he had more motivation than Nico to win the world championship because of his upbringing in a flat in Stevenage as against Nico growing up in Monaco,' added Surtees. 'If Nico wasn't already inspired to win his first world championship, then Lewis certainly would have provided some material for him to dig even deeper.' Frosty: Lewis Hamilton's attitude after Nico Rosberg's 'error' in qualifying reflected badly and didn't help him Controversial: Rosberg was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in Saturday's qualifying session Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff, meanwhile, has downplayed claims the rivalry between the pair is starting to resemble that of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. Three-times champion Senna and four-times king Prost were bitter enemies during the two seasons they spent together at McLaren in 1988 and 1989. On the team website, Wolff said: 'We have seen a lot of talk about their relationship, but that's not the key thing for a successful campaign. 'It's a job, not a holiday, and the drivers need to work with and for the team first of all. 'There have been a lot of comparisons to the Senna/Prost scenario, which is a kind of compliment to both Lewis and Nico. 'But the situation here is very different. It's an intense relationship but this intensity is normal. 'The racing philosophy of Mercedes-Benz is to allow our drivers to compete. We let the boys play with their toys, unless they break them.'"

The self-effacing 33-year old has recently graced the covers of China's editions of Harper's Bazaar and Elle magazines, but bringing her face to an audience away from China's mainland remains elusive. Zhou is demur on the topic of international acclaim, preferring only to say that she hopes to become a better actress rather than rival Zhang Ziyi as the face of Chinese cinema abroad. Her latest film is ""Confucius"" also starring Chow Yun Fat, but Zhou made her breakthrough on the big screen in 2000 appearing in ""Suzhou River,"" and was soon hailed by the Chinese media as one of the country's four best young actresses along with Zhao Wei, Xu Jinglei and Zhang Ziyi. Since then Zhou has taken on a number of alternative roles -- from a nerdy lab technician in ""All About Women"" to an alcoholic spy in ""The Message"" -- that have marked her out from her peers and attracted plaudits from critics and fans. She won best actress awards at the Paris Film Festival in 2000 and numerous awards in China for her role in 2005 film ""Perhaps Love"" and more recently, ""The Equation of Love and Death."" Coming from a middle class family, she was a young girl at a dance academy when spotted by a film director and encouraged to become an actress. ""Being an actress in China, I'm actually a very lucky actress... Especially now that Chinese movies are becoming more diverse with more viewers overseas,"" she told CNN. ""I think it's the same to be an actress anywhere because the profession is about attitudes towards events -- it is a process to try to understand life. I think this is the case for actors across the world. ""It all comes down to how you try to be a good person, and act responsibly."" Acting responsibly, that is, except when the role demands it. Her clean-cut image was tarnished, on-screen at least, when she took a method approach to her part as a hard-drinking spook in ""The Message."" She admits to turning up on the set intoxicated in order to get into character.

Two Spanish military cargo planes, which retrieved the nearly 594,000 coins in crates from a secretive warehouse in Florida, landed at the Torrejon military air base in Madrid just before 2 p.m. (8 a.m. ET). The two planes arrived at a U.S. military base in Florida earlier this week -- on the heels of a team of Spanish government experts who did an inventory of the treasure -- and departed on Friday for the overnight flight to Madrid. That was after the Florida company, Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. had exhausted its legal appeals all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined without comment Odyssey's motion for a hearing earlier this month. ""Spain has now been victorious at every level in the United States courts, from Tampa to Atlanta to Washington,"" said Jim Goold, who defended Spain's claim to the treasure. ""I am pleased and proud for all of us."" Odyssey Marine Exploration made an emergency appeal to the high court in an attempt to block a lower court's order that it turn over the treasure to Spain. The dispute goes back to 2007, when Odyssey announced it had found a 19th-century sunken ship off of Spain. The company claimed ownership of the coins and said it had flown them to a guarded location in the United States. Spain filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure. Spain says its navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was carrying the coins. The 34-gun frigate left Peru in 1804 and crossed the Atlantic to within a day's sail from Spain when British ships attacked the Spanish fleet. In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary, south of Portugal, the Mercedes was hit in its powder magazine and exploded, according to the Spanish government's filing to the Florida court. In 2009, the federal court in Tampa ruled in favor of Spain and the federal appeals court in Atlanta upheld the ruling last September. Last January 31, the appeals court denied an Odyssey motion, which Odyssey appealed to the Supreme Court. Spain's Culture Minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, told CNN in Madrid earlier this month that the case was never really about the money. ""We're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition, but this is something that enriches our material, artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such,"" Wert said in an interview. He said the coins would be exhibited at Spanish museums, and perhaps elsewhere. Peru, too, has followed the fate of the coins, which came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony. ""Formally, they haven't claimed anything, but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the Latin American museums,"" Wert said. The treasure includes fabled ""pieces of eight,"" some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials have said. The treasure, which already has crossed the Atlantic Ocean twice, by ship in 1804 and then by plane in 2007, has now arrived on the Spanish mainland for the first time. A Spanish Defense Ministry official at the Torrejon base said the treasure will be turned over to Spain's paramilitary Civil Guard for safekeeping. The Culture Ministry is expected to hold a news conference and possibly show off a portion of the coins in the coming days."

""We don't know what the next day is going to bring, so we're just trusting the Lord,"" her brother Brian Swaffer said Sunday. ""We're taking it one day at a time."" Her twins, Ian and Abigail, are being cared for by family and friends as their mother battles necrotizing fasciitis at Greenville Memorial Hospital. Their uncle told reporters from outside the western South Carolina hospital that both babies are ""doing great."" ""They are healthy and doing well,"" Swaffer said. They were born May 7 in Atlanta. At that time, Kuykendall was healthy but, a few days later, she went to hospital near her South Carolina home after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg, her husband Darren, a firefighter, told CNN last week. Since going to the hospital on May 11, Kuykendall has been ""intubated and sedated,"" her brother said. ""She does respond sometimes, you can see in her blood pressure. She has opened her eyes a little bit at times,"" said Swaffer, who has been going back and forth from his sister's side to his home in western North Carolina. ""But that's pretty much it."" Kuykendall's health is precarious, though Swaffer expressed gratitude Sunday it appears confined to her legs and has not affected her internal organs. That is unlike Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate student at the University of West Georgia suffering from the same disease. She has already lost a leg, part of her abdomen, her remaining foot and her hands, according to online posts from her father, Andy Copeland. Swaffer also gave thanks Sunday for the support that his sister, a paramedic, has gotten from fellow relatives, friends and the community, as well as medical staff. He pointed to two efforts in particular -- one by fellow EMTs called ""Loops for Lana,"" selling navy blue and green bracelets, as well as a fundraiser ride by the South Carolina chapter of the Knights of the Inferno Firefighters Motorcycle Club -- to raise money for Kuykendall and her family. ""So many people in the community have rallied behind her, and we're so thankful for that,"" Swaffer said. The condition that Kuykendall and Copeland are facing, necrotizing fasciitis, is rare. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 cases occur each year in the United States, though such estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Caused by a number of bacteria, the disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The responsible bacteria are common in the environment, though they rarely cause infections. When they do, the body's immune system is almost always able to fight them off, according to experts. Occasionally, however, the bacteria find their way into the bloodstream -- either through a cut or an abrasion. In such cases, doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain."

Flight crew on a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 first spotted an unmanned drone as the jumbo jet made its final approach on a flight from London last Sunday evening. The captain told officials that the drone was flying at an altitude of around 3,000ft in airspace over Nassau County, just east of the airport. A Virgin Atlantic pilot alerted air traffic control after spotting a drone at an altitude of 3,000ft Radio-controlled drones have skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the growing trend of aerial photography Around a minute later, a Delta Air Lines pilot who was behind the controls of a Boeing 737 arriving from San Diego told air traffic controllers that the drone was flying too close to its left wing as it flew over Nassau County, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). According to an audio recording obtained by NBC News, the Delta pilot told the air traffic control tower: ‘We just had something fly over us. I don’t know if it was a drone or a balloon, it just came real quick.’ Another incident was reported on Wednesday afternoon as a JetBlue plane from Savannah, Georgia, prepared to land at JFK. Nassau County police were unable to locate the drone during an aerial search by helicopter The drone was flying at about 400ft as it buzzed near the Airbus A320 over Nassau County. Air traffic control recordings captured the pilot's concern telling controllers that the drone looked like it was flying right on the final approach, NBC reported. Despite raising concerns, none of the pilots had to take evasive action and all three planes landed safely. A drone was flying at about 400ft as it buzzed a JetBlue Airbus A320 over Nassau County Local police, the FBI and FAA were all notified, and Nassau County police were unable to locate the drone or its operator during an aerial search by helicopter. If the operator is identified, he or she could face criminal charges. Unmanned drones have skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the growing trend of aerial photography, and they have become a serious problem for airports and pilots as many operators are not aware of the rules or dangers. There have been dozens of reports of drones flying too close to airports or commercial aircraft, and experts say the radio-controlled devices pose a significant threat because they could be sucked into a jet engine. Three commercial pilots encountered drones while making their final approach to JFK Airport in New York Hobbyists are allowed to use drones for recreational flights but the tiny aircraft are not permitted within five miles of airports and they must be kept far from planes. Ken Honig, a former high-ranking official with the Port Authority, which operates major airports in New York City and some New Jersey cities, told NBC that drone operators probably don't realise the devastating damage they could cause. He said: ‘These planes are all being approached [by drones] while the planes are landing, so they're close to the ground, which means the pilot doesn't have a whole lot of room for manoeuvring. ‘If the unmanned aerial vehicle gets too close to a plane, it could get sucked into a jet engine. The kind of damage done by a bird could be amplified by the metal parts in a UAV.’"

Above, his sister, Vivien Robson, in her mother's garden, where the ashes used to be buried Distraught: Joseph Pringle, 64, died from heart failure in 1996 and his remains were buried in his wife Ruby's (picture, right, with Ms Robson) garden in Spittal in Berwick, Northumberland. But in November, they vanished But in November, Mrs Pringle, now 82, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, went into the garden and discovered the urn had vanished, while the rose bush had been upended. Following a police investigation, her eldest son, Stephen Pringle, was charged with stealing the cremated remains. The 52-year-old appeared before Berwick Magistrates' Court on Monday, where he was found not guilty of committing a criminal offence. Cremated:  The ashes of Joseph Pringle (pictured) had been stored in an urn and hidden under a rose bush for 17 years before they were taken But despite the outcome, Mr Pringle admits he has taken the ashes - although he is still yet to reveal their exact whereabouts to his family. Yesterday, his mother and siblings Vivien Robson, 58, Ann Chissel, 46, and Gordon Pringle, 48, pleaded with him to disclose the location of his father's remains. 'Just let us know exactly where you have scattered my dad. We could go and put some flowers down,' said Mrs Chissel, also from Berwick. 'At the end of the day, we were all very close to my dad.' Mrs Chissel said her brother had taken the ashes following a family row over a loan, and had later revealed that he had scattered them somewhere in Ormiston in East Lothian, Scotland. But after visiting the village and raking through rubbish bins, the family have still not managed to recover any trace of the urn. 'It is like my dad has died all over again but now we don't have anything to show for it,' she said. 'When he died we knew where he was and now it is like that closure has been taken away from us. 'This has wrecked the whole family because we were all pretty close. When we found out this had happened, we couldn't believe it and we don't know why it has happened.' She added: 'We believe that Stephen still has the ashes. We don't know why he is doing this to us. We would be happy if he even took us and showed us where he scattered them. All that is left: In November, Mrs Pringle, now 82, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, went into the garden and discovered the urn had vanished, while the rose bush had been upended (pictured) 'We just want to know what has happened. It would help if we just knew.' Mr Pringle's solicitor Ian O'Rourke said yesterday the case was the 'most extraordinary case' he has ever had to deal with, and should never have reached court. 'It was a dreadful and very sad case. This man [Stephen Pringle] did not act dishonestly at all. It has been quite a distressing case to see a family torn apart like this,' he said. Sister: Mr Pringle has admitted taking the ashes - but is yet to reveal their exact whereabouts to his family Mr O'Rourke said his client had admitted taking the ashes after things came to a head one night when he had taken prescribed tranquillisers. 'Stephen wanted to scatter the ashes where his father was born in Ormiston,' he said. But he added that there is hope for the fractured family as mediation is an option, saying: 'When Stephen was interviewed by police, he was more than willing to engage in mediation.' When approached by reporters, Mr Pringle said he did not wish to comment."

The rabbits ran from all directions to chase after the woman From 1929 to 1945, more than 6,000 tons of poison gas were manufactured on the remote island, and the program was shrouded in secrecy. For 16 years, Okunoshima was left off maps, and workers who produced the five types of poison gas - which were mostly used in warfare in China - were told to keep the factories a secret. But somewhere along the line rabbits were introduced and - as rabbits tend to do - they bred fast. Some sources claim they were brought to the island to test the effects of the poison and released by workers when the war ended. Others sources say that a group of schoolchildren on a field trip released eight of the animals in 1971. Now tourists flock to the 2.5 mile wide Inland Sea island off the coast of Takehara to feed and pet the hundreds of bunnies that call it home. And it's easy to see why.

Eliot Spitzer. Gov. Eliot Spitzer, with his wife, Silda, by his side, apologizes to his family and to the public. The affidavit does not mention Spitzer by name, but a source with knowledge of the case said the subject identified as Client-9 is the governor. Spitzer took office in January 2007 after serving eight years as the state's attorney general, when he rose to national prominence as a hard-charging prosecutor. He has not been charged. Spitzer, who is married with three children, went before reporters Monday to confess to an undisclosed personal indiscretion, saying he had acted ""in a way that violates my obligations to my family, that violates my or any sense of right and wrong."" He did not acknowledge the allegations, which were revealed Monday in The New York Times, nor did he take questions.  Watch Spitzer's apology » His alleged involvement with the ring was caught on a federal wiretap, the source said. The prostitute, identified only as ""Kristen"" worked for the Emperors Club, which charged between $1,000 and $5,500 an hour and operated in New York; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; London, England; and Paris, France, according to court papers. According to the affidavit, defendant Temeka Rachelle Lewis -- who is accused of working as a booking agent for the club -- wrote a text message Monday, February 11, asking the operation's day-to-day organizer to ""pls let me know if (Client-9's) 'package' arrives 2mrw. Appt wd be on Wed."" Prosecutors say the message was a reference to a deposit. On Tuesday, according to the affidavit, Lewis sent a message to Kristen, saying Client-9's deposit had not arrived but she should be able to ""do the trip"" if it arrived the next day.  View a gallery of recent political sex scandals » In a later conversation, Lewis and Kristen discussed when the prostitute could take a train from New York's Penn Station to Washington's Union Station, the affidavit says. Client-9 would be ""paying for everything -- train tickets, cab fare from the hotel and back, mini bar or room service, travel time, and hotel."" The affidavit says that, about 5 p.m. Tuesday, February 12, Lewis spoke with Client-9 on the telephone and told him that his ""package arrived today."" The client asked Lewis whom he would be meeting and, when told it was Kristen, said, ""Great, OK, wonderful."" The two discussed how the woman would get a key to his room for a Wednesday rendezvous and how they could arrange credit for future services. ""Client-9 asked Lewis to remind him what Kristen looked like and Lewis said that she was an American, petite, very pretty brunette, 5 feet 5 inches and 105 pounds,"" the affidavit reads. In a call to Lewis, Client-9 was told the balance would be $2,712.41, but Lewis suggested he give Kristen $1,500 or $2,000 more so that he would have a credit. According to the affidavit, Kristen called Lewis about 9:32 p.m. Wednesday, February 13, and told her she was in Client-9's room -- No. 871 -- at the Washington hotel. Four minutes later, Client-9 was in the hotel, Lewis told Kristen in another call. No more calls were logged until 12:02 a.m. Thursday -- Valentine's Day -- nearly 2½ hours later. At that time, Kristen told Lewis Client-9 had left and she had collected $4,300. Lewis told the prostitute she'd been told that Client-9 ""would ask you to do things that, like, you might not think are safe -- you know -- I mean that ... very basic things,"" the affidavit says. Kristen told Lewis, ""I have a way of dealing with that. ... I'd be like, listen dude, you really want the sex?"" ""I don't think he's difficult,"" Kristen is quoted as saying. ""I mean it's just kind of like ... whatever ... I'm here for a purpose. I know what my purpose is. I am not a ... moron, you know what I mean."" Spitzer, who built his career on rooting out public corruption as New York attorney general, became a national figure with a series of high-profile Wall Street investigations. He is also known for prosecuting prostitution rings.  See a timeline of his life » Now his lawyers may be questioned about how he paid for the alleged hotel encounter, whether the trail was concealed and whether any banking laws were circumvented as a result, the source said. The investigation into the Emperor's Club, which began in October 2007, included evidence from a confidential source identified in court papers as a prostitute who worked at the club in 2006 and was given immunity. It also included statements from an undercover officer who posed as a customer, more than 5,000 intercepted phone calls and text messages, more than 6,000 e-mails recovered with search warrants, bank records, travel and hotel records and physical surveillance. Despite the high cost of the club's services, the job was not alluring to one potential employee, who sent an e-mail to the club's management January 28 after speaking to a friend who was working for the agency. ""I wasn't very happy to find out that it's only 500 ph + over 50% commission fees ...

She added: ""The other think [sic] I was a little bit shock and confuse that she had a sex with him twice in an hour and without her taking her out for dinner before. ...

Yet after a day of fighting, rebel forces remained in control, said activists, suggesting they had successfully fought off the government's initial assault. The international community has raised an outcry about a possible massacre in this city of three million but acknowledged there was little they could do to stop the bloodshed. Syrian rebels arrest a man who they said was a government informant during the fighting in Aleppo The foreign minister of Russia, a powerful ally of Syria, said it was ""simply unrealistic"" for the Syrian regime to cede control. The state-controlled al-Watan newspaper celebrated the assault with a banner headline proclaiming the fight for Aleppo 'the mother of all battles'. The rebels are estimated to control between a third and a half of the districts in Aleppo, especially a cluster in the north-east around Sakhour neighbourhood and in the south-west. Syrian rebels sit in a pick up truck.

About 162 people have been killed, mostly civilians, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which does not include soldiers in its toll. Some 19,000 people have been killed since the uprising began in March 2011, estimated the group. Today, activists estimate that at least two dozen have died so far in the day's fighting. Local activist Mohammed Saeed said the rebels have managed to keep the regime's tanks at bay so far with rocket-propelled grenades. ""The army hasn't been able to take any neighbourhoods yet, there are too many from the Free Syrian Army,"" Saeed said, referring to the rebels.

Tonight, according to the Observatory, the government appeared to have pulled back from its ground offensive and was resuming its bombardment of various neighbourhoods with artillery. Attack helicopters pounded rebel positions. The international community has expressed growing concern that there could be major bloodshed if Syrian troops retake Aleppo. But Western nations and their allies have found themselves powerless to prevent the situation from deteriorating despite a series of diplomatic efforts, including a cease-fire agreement that never took effect.

The group's deputy chief, Ahmed Ben Hali added that the Arab states were preparing a resolution in front of the United Nations General Assembly calling for the creation of safe havens to protect civilians and to apply further sanctions on the regime. Measures passed in the General Assembly are largely symbolic and not binding. The West and its Arab allies have been unable to pass effective resolutions in the more powerful Security Council. China, and especially Syria's close ally, Russia, have vetoed any attempt to sanction Bashar Assad's regime. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the bloodshed in Aleppo a tragedy, but asked what else could the government do against the rebellion. ""Now the city of Aleppo is occupied by the armed opposition; another tragedy is imminent there,"" he said. ""How can it be hoped that in such a situation the government will simply give in, say 'Okay, I wasn't right, overthrow me, change the regime - it's simply unrealistic."" Russia has been a key source of support for Syria, although Moscow officials in recent months have said they are simply taking a more even-handed approach while the West offers support to the rebels.

The public bus she boarded normally carries ultra-Orthodox passengers and travels to an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem. As a matter of custom women sit in the back portion of the bus, because the ultra-Orthodox avoid mingling of the sexes according to their beliefs. She was the first passenger that morning on the bus and took a seat behind the driver. As the bus took on more passengers along its route, an ultra-orthodox man demanded she should sit in the back of the bus as is the custom on that route. ""I heard him call me 'Shikse,'"" Rosenblit wrote on her Facebook page, referencing a Yiddish term for a non-Jewish woman. ""He demanded I sit in the back of the bus, because Jewish men couldn't sit behind women (!!!). I refused."" ""This is my home town of Ashdod, I live in an Israeli democracy, people cannot tell me where to sit on a bus."" An argument ensued and ultimately the bus driver called the police to intervene, but not before a crowd of black-clad ultra-orthodox men had gathered outside the bus. ""I was starting to get scared, to tell you the truth,"" Rosenblit recalled. ""There were like 20 of them, all wearing black. Most of them were just curious, but they were definitely on his side."" Rosenblit snapped throughout this disruption, and said she was comfortable knowing that Israeli law was on her side. In a case brought by an Israeli woman earlier this year, the country's Supreme Court ruled that involuntary separation between the sexes on public buses was against the law. The responding police officer tried to talk to everyone and calm things down. Rosenblit said he asked if she was willing to show respect for the objectors and move to the back of the bus. She refused and, after a 30-minute delay, the bus moved on to Jerusalem with her sitting up front. A day after posting the account on Facebook, Rosenblit's story was picked up by the Israeli media, which has been devoting a lot of coverage to the public outcry over the growing political power of the ultra-Orthodox in Israel, and fears they are forcing the generally secular Israeli public to adopt their religious standards. Israel's largest circulation newspaper put her story on its front page with the headline, ""They Won't Tell Me Where to Sit,"" and compared Rosenblit to the American civil rights movement's legendary Rosa Parks. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought up her story in his weekly cabinet meeting. ""Up until this day we have agreed to live in peace with mutual respect by all sectors of the Israeli society,"" he told his government ministers. ""In recent days we witness attempts to break this coexistence apart. Today, for example, I have heard of an attempt to move a woman from her seat on a bus. I oppose this unequivocally. I believe we must not allow margins groups to break our common denominator and we must keep our public spaces open and safe for all of our citizens. We must find the uniting and mediating ground rather than the things that divide and separate us."" Netanyahu said. Rosenblit also received a call from Israel's opposition leader, Tzipi Livni, who offered her support and called her a symbol of determination against ""anti-democratic radicalization that pushes women away from the public space."" A spokesman for Egged, the transportation company that runs the bus line, told CNN in a statement that it ""does not deal with seating arrangements"" on its buses and that ""even if there are population groups that prefer to sit separately due to their beliefs, it is a voluntary choice and does not bind the other passengers."" Rosenblit describes herself as secular and said she did not ride the bus looking for a confrontation. She said what motivated her to write about her experience was not ""not to declare the Orthodox Jews as pure evil and the oppressors of human rights and liberties,"" but to point out what she sees as societal problem in Israel. ""There are a lot of lovely things about religion, but forcing people to choose religion is wrong,"" she said. ""It is wrong to use religion as an excuse to eliminate people's basic rights: the right for freedom and the right for dignity."""

Women who sport the look or use styling products such as heated rollers or straightening irons risk damaging their scalp and losing hair, say scientists. The Croydon facelift, adopted by women including Katy Perry, Cheryl Cole, Tulisa and Little Britain’s Vicky Pollard, involves pulling the hair into such a tight ponytail that the face is stretched like it would be with surgery. It is named after the hometown of supermodel Kate Moss, who popularised the style. In other parts of the country the look has different names: in Essex it is known as the 'Dagenham facelift', in Northern Ireland the 'Millie facelift', and in other areas simply the 'council house facelift'. But university researchers in America have warned that the style could be permanently damaging, and not only to the hair itself, but to the scalp too. And so too could other female styling accessories, including hot rollers, straightening irons and chemical relaxers, used to unwind tight curly hair. Dermatologists at the Southwestern Medical Center in the University of Texas have discovered that both the hairstyle and these modern hair accessories leads to hair loss from the root itself and chemical damage to the scalp. And while these problems can sometimes be remedied with treatment, this specific type of hair loss - known as traction alopecia' - is often permanent and can lead to bald patches. British supermodel Kate Moss, left, who comes from Croydon, the London borough which loaned its name to the hairstyle, and American actress Sarah Jessica Parker, right, who adopted the look across the Atlantic The study recommends 'hair holidays' where women take a regular day off from styling their hair to let it recover naturally from all the hot irons and rough treatment of previous days. Tips to avoid damage include regular washing - as a buildup of oil is bad for the roots - and using 'natural hairstyles' that do not need heat treatment, because these place less tension on roots. Research leader Dr Josephone Quintanilla-Dieck said: 'Pulling hair into tight ponytails or braids; using hot rollers, curling irons, or straightening irons; and applying chemical relaxers can all lead to structural damage of the hair shaft as well as thermal and chemical damage to the skin of the scalp. Singer Cheryl Cole, left, comes from Newcastle, while X-Factor judge Tulisa is from Camden in north London, but both have a soft spot for the Croydon facelift, which could be seriously damaging their scalps forever 'Regular and sometimes even occasional use of these hair techniques may lead to hair breakage and hair loss from the root. 'Although usually reversible, hair loss occasionally can be permanent with longstanding or severe cases.' Scraping the hair back into a Croydon facelift puts too much 'structural' pressure on the root of the hair, said the study."

Sean Hoare, who was found dead at his flat in Watford, Hertfordshire, had spent much of the last weeks of his life 'hiding' in his flat with the curtains drawn. A post mortem examination revealed that there was no third party involvement in the death. Officers are not treating the death as suspicious although it will be several weeks before they have full toxicology results. A friend and neighbour claimed Mr Hoare, 47, had become increasingly reclusive and paranoid in recent weeks. ‘He would talk about someone from the Government coming to get him,' he said. 'He’d say to me, “If anyone comes by, don’t say I’m in”. 'He was physically going downhill. He was yellow in colour and wasn’t looking well for the last month. ‘He had a constant struggle with alcohol and talked to me about how much he had put his wife through. ‘He did say something about phone hacking and I think that was his main worry. He had definite concerns with the media. He did mention he was paranoid and would mention conspiracy stuff.’ Former News of the World journalist Mr Hoare had accused former Tory media chief Andy Coulson of lying about his role in the affair. He said that when editor of the paper, Mr Coulson actively encouraged his staff to intercept the calls of celebrities. It was his explosive claims last autumn that reignited the scandal and ultimately led to the tumultuous events of the past fortnight which have shaken the political, police and media establishments. Police were investigating the possibility that he had killed himself, saying his death was ‘not thought to be suspicious’. His death came after: Mr Hoare in the sitting room of his home. A friend and neighbour claimed Mr Hoare had become increasingly reclusive and paranoid in recent weeks Tragic: Police are investigating the death of Mr Hoare after his body was found at his Hertfordshire home The body of Mr Hoare, 47, was discovered by police on Monday morning at his modern first-floor flat in Watford. The former reporter blew the whistle during an investigation by the New York Times last September, pointing the finger directly at Mr Coulson, by then the Prime Minister’s communications chief. Until Mr Hoare spoke out in September, pressure had eased on Mr Coulson, recruited by David Cameron as his media chief in 2007 after resigning as editor of the News of the World when royal reporter Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed. Last week, Mr Hoare was back in the spotlight with further claims, telling the New York Times that reporters at the News of the World were able to use police technology to locate people using their mobile phone signals in exchange for payments to police officers. Mr Coulson, who quit Downing Street in January and was arrested over hacking earlier this month, has strenuously denied Mr Hoare’s allegations. Allegations: Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson was aware phone hacking took place at the paper, Mr Hoare claimed last year Last year Mr Hoare (right) claimed that Andy Coulson was aware of phone hacking while he was editor at the News of the World. He gave an interview to the New York Times, and then to the BBC, about the use of phone hacking at the newspaper. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he said phone hacking was 'endemic' in the newspaper industry. Mr Hoare, who worked on the Sun before being recruited by Mr Coulson to work on the NOTW, said: 'He was well aware that the practice exists. To deny it is a lie, simply a lie.' Mr Coulson denies the allegations. Later, Mr Hoare was interviewed by police over the allegations he had made but would offer no comment, Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said in December. He issued a statement last year that he had ‘never condoned the use of phone hacking and nor do I have any recollection of incidences where phone hacking took place’. But Mr Hoare told Radio 4’s PM programme that phone hacking was ‘endemic’ at the newspaper and said of his former boss: ‘He was well aware that the practice exists. To deny it is a lie, simply a lie.’ Police could not rule out suicide but friends suggested natural causes was also a possibility as he had been suffering from ill health. A Hertfordshire Police spokeswoman added: 'The man's next of kin have been informed and the family are being supported by police at this sad time.' Officers have yet to confirm arrangements for an inquest to be opened. His solicitor David Sonn said: ‘I last spoke to him a week ago and he seemed fine. I am shocked and saddened. It is a terrible tragedy.’ He added: ‘In giving his statement to the New York Times, he was arguably the catalyst for everything that has happened since.’  When Mr Coulson was made editor of the News of the World in 2003, he recruited Mr Hoare as a showbusiness reporter. Investigation: Forensic officers and a policeman at the flat of Mr Hoare They had previously both worked on The Sun’s showbusiness column Bizarre. One former colleague said: ‘At The Sun, they were absolutely the best of buddies. They used to go out to Covent Garden and socialise all night together. Andy would cover for Sean, or vice versa, if one of them was too hung over for work. ‘I last saw Sean at a do not all that long after he left the News of the World. He was looking very scrubbed and sober and I asked what he planned to do, and he said he wanted to get back into journalism but added, “Journalism has turned its back on me”.’ Mr Hoare was sacked from the News of the World over drink and drug problems in 2005, and last year sources at the paper said that his claims should be treated with ‘extreme scepticism’. But a friend who saw him more recently described him as ‘sober’ and wanting to rebuild his career.

Mexico, who hosted the World Cup in 1970 and 1986, were always considered outsiders in the 2018/2022 tender. With the neighbouring United States putting together an impressive bid and the 2014 edition being staged in Brazil, it was always unlikely that FIFA would opt for more than one country in the Americas when voting on the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 events. The other bidders include England, Australia, Indonesia, Japan and Russia, while Portugal and Spain have tabled a joint bid, as have Belgium and the Netherlands. South Korea and Qatar will compete with the other eight bids to host the 2022 World Cup, with FIFA set to decide on the hosts of both events in December 2010. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke added: ""Even though Mexico, one of the biggest football nations on earth and host of two FIFA World Cups, has finally opted to withdraw its bid to stage a third edition, FIFA wishes to thank the whole Mexican football family for having taken part in this process. ""We obviously fully respect this decision and are very much looking forward to continued cooperation with the Mexican Football Federation as another very nice goal approaches, namely the FIFA Under-17 World Cup 2011, for which the preparations are well on track."""

The deaths of both stillborn infants have been classified as ‘serious incidents’ at the unit which has previously been criticised for its patient care and deteriorating finances. Basildon and Thurrock was one of 11 NHS trusts placed in special measures in July 2013 amid concerns over its above average death rates. Basildon Hospital in Essex is investigating the deaths of two stillborn babies in September last year It was then given a clean bill of health in June last year, following a ‘good’ rating from the Care Quality Commission. Its maternity unit was also the first in the country to receive an ‘outstanding’ grade. However a regular assessment report has revealed that two babies died within weeks of each other in September, and the hospital has now launched a probe into the matter. One of the mothers was induced at Basildon Hospital in Essex despite staff not checking her full clinical details first. The woman was suffering from high blood pressure, or hypertension, which meant she was categorised as ‘high risk’ – though this has not been confirmed as the direct cause of the baby’s death. The other death is ‘still unexplained’ pending a post-mortem examination. Families involved in the deaths have not been named. Staff have since been instructed to carry out blood pressure tests on women with hypertension as their labour progresses, as the report concluded that there had been ‘no room for complacency’ in the monitoring of the first mother or her baby. Midwives have also been reminded to seek the opinion of medical staff on how to manage women where there is ‘any deviation from the normal’. The review looked into 37 ‘serious incidents’ at the hospital in recent months – 19 of which had ‘moderate to catastrophic’ impact on patients. Stephen Metcalfe, MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock, said he hoped there would not be a repeat of any mistakes. MP Stephen Metcalfe says the hospital is more open and transparent after previous investigations He said: 'Every complex organisation faces a number of challenges but I have complete confidence in the team. 'The Care Quality Commission has said the trust is moving the right way. It does not mean they can be complacent but we need to work with and support them. 'If the hospital is now reporting more incidents it is because there is now a more open and transparent culture which is willing to accept and investigate mistakes and make sure they do not happen again.' However Dan Chapple, of campaign group Cure The NHS, said promises of further investigation were ‘not good enough’. He said: ‘It is a shame to see the same problems with Basildon hospital recurring at a time when the CQC has deemed this hospital safe enough to be brought out of special measures. ‘The hospital’s normal comment with these sorts of incidents is that they will learn from them but when similar incidents recur year after year it just is not good enough.’ A review last year found deaths among weekend admissions contributed to the hospital's death rate being 11 per cent higher than the average NHS hospital. In the two years to October 2012, there were 544 more deaths than expected. The trust was removed from special measures last June after the quality of services improved. But it emerged last month that health service watchdog Monitor had launched an fresh investigation into the finances of the hospital. Monitor is concerned about a predicted deficit of £14.2m because it is larger than previously expected. Monitor was told about the loss when a revised deficit plan was submitted in November and will now seek to find out why finances have deteriorated and what can be done to fix them. A Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'It is unclear at this stage whether any of the patients died as a direct result of the serious incident as they are still being investigated. 'Basildon Hospital is committed to providing all its patients with safe, high-quality treatment and care. Crucial to that is learning when things go wrong.'"

City are aiming to bounce back from a disappointing Champions League defeat against Barcelona on Tuesday but can close the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to two points by beating Liverpool at lunchtime, with Jose Mourinho's men occupied in the Capital One Cup final. Hart has already won two championship medals with City but says it has done nothing to dampen his desire to collect more despite Chelsea being odds-on favourites to claim the crown in May. Joe Hart is in excellent form and hoping to help Manchester City to defend their Premier League title Hart rushes out to deny Lionel Messi during the 2-1 Champions League defeat to Barcelona in midweek 'Chelsea are performing well this season but there are plenty of twists and turns to come. Last weekend (when Chelsea and Burnley drew 1-1) proved that. 'We have had results like that too and it's a damn hard league to win. That's why we are so proud of the two we've won so far and why we want three, four, five. 'People write you off but we have proved them wrong before and we will do it in the Premier League. We are 100% fit with an amazing squad, look at the quality we have in our squad. We are in the right place it's now down to us. Hart saved a crucial penalty to keep City in the tie, and is now turning his attention back to the league Chelsea dropped points against Burnley last week, and City can further close the gap on Sunday 'We won't give in, we are here to win and that's all we want to do. It is what we believe in together and we are hungry to try to do that.' Hart has had an outstanding season and signed a new long-term contract after losing his place to Willie Caballero early on. He accepts criticism as part of the job at City and is quick to defend manager Manuel Pellegrini, whose tactics were questioned against Barcelona. 'That's life being at Manchester City. I let a goal in and I'm under pressure. We miss chances and we don't score the lads are under pressure,' he said. Hart believes City have enough quality in their squad to defend the title which they won last May 'But that's why we are at this club. We aren't here to hide. The manager doesn't want to be manager of this club so he can hide. He fronts it up. 'He has been a great manager for us and will continue to try and win things with us and we want to win things with him.'"

""My new political party won't be named Mega Party. We are the Internet Party,"" he tweeted Wednesday. The aim of the Internet Party is to make politics exciting again, he said through Twitter. The larger-than-life entrepreneur is a German native and can't personally run for office as he is not a citizen of New Zealand. However he alluded to his desire to focus his party's policies around internet privacy and government surveillance. Dotcom founded file-sharing website Megaupload in 2005, which allowed users to upload music, videos and files. It was accused of being an online haven for digital pirates. The U.S. government shut down the site in 2012 in a piracy crackdown. Dotcom had assets frozen and was arrested in the crackdown that included a police raid on his luxurious house near the capital, Auckland and was remanded to Mt. Eden prison. A judge overturned the verdict just over a month later. Since then, he has faced numerous legal battles. In New Zealand, Dotcom has worked on various projects -- with politics being the latest. Antihero appeal? Bryce Edwards, a political commentator and lecturer at the University of Otago in New Zealand, believes that Dotcom has become an unlikely beloved figure in the country. ""We haven't seen a maverick like Kim Dotcom throw his weight into politics, this is someone wanted for crimes allegedly committed and has an extreme personality, and strangely New Zealanders have really warmed to it,"" Edwards said. New Zealand's general elections are expected to take place before the end of this year. According to numerous political analysts, there is no clear front-runner, making it difficult to predict the outcome. ""In the past, Dotcom has infamously donated money to a politician called John Banks who is quite far on the right of the political spectrum, so there are assumptions that Dotcom is politically at the right but it's pretty uncertain,"" said Edwards. He also cautioned that Dotcom's Internet Party must win at least 5%in order to make any impact on the political scene. Gaining anything less would make people ""feel like they are wasting their vote."" In order for a party to be sworn into parliament in a country with over 3 million eligible voters, it must obtain this crucial 5% threshold or win a constituency. In a further comment on Twitter, Dotcom appeared confident that the Internet Party would make it mark at the election. ""Get ready for low blows and smear against me and my political party. My attackers are worried. They should be. We will get more than 5%,"" he stated on the microblogging site. Other than technological advocacy, it's unclear what the party's exact policies are. Edwards believes the Internet Party is set to focus on some key voting groups including the youth, tech-savvy people and those that have become disillusioned with the current system such as those from a lower socio-economic background and ethnic minorities. A man of many talents It's not only politics that Dotcom has dabbled in lately. He was planning to launch his debut album titled ""Good Times"" at a huge birthday bash for himself on January 20. However, he had to cancel the event because of a potential breach of electoral laws as it was being held for free. Over 20,000 people had registered on Twitter to attend. Dotcom says he increasingly turned to music to escape his legal woes of the past few years. ""When you have a family with five kids, and you're facing an indictment with potentially 80 years in prison, you're not in a good state of mind. But that's why the music really helped me. When I was in the studio, everything else just turned off,"" he said in an interview with The Guardian this week. Megaupload has since been succeeded by an almost identical venture under a new, shortened name -- Mega. Dotcom has said that he will release more details of his new political party on January 20."

But nearly seven decades ago these women were serving as guards at Hitler’s death camps, shepherding hundreds of Nazi Germany’s victims to their deaths. The women are among some 24 suspects now being investigated by prosecutors in Germany for their wartime roles as accomplices to mass murder. Despite the fact there are no witnesses left alive to testify as to what they did, prosecutors hope that the mere fact of serving in a place of suffering and death will be enough to bring charges and guilty verdicts. Probe: Charlotte S, left, now 94, was an SS guard in the Nazi death camps Ravensbrück and Auschwitz, according to Stasi records, while Gisela S, is pictured right in her card index of concentration camp guards Horror: Prisoners produce weapons in the concentration camp of Dachau during World War Two Last week a former Dachau guard identified only as Horst P, aged 87, was pictured at his Berlin home with a collage of photos of him in his SS uniform beneath the words Mein Kampf – the title of Adolf Hitler’s hate-filled blueprint for racial war. Now the central authority for the prosecution of Nazi war crimes, based in Ludwigsburg, has sent out files on 24 more suspects, including three women. Gertrud Elli Schmid, now 92 and living in Hamburg, is one of the suspects. She was formerly an SS guard at Majdanek in the Polish city of Lublin where an estimated 235,000 people were murdered during WW2. Prosecutors have traced her SS identity card. After service in Majdanek she was sent to Auschwitz, also in occupied Poland, where 1.1million prisoners were exterminated. Now wheelchair bound, she was tracked down by the daily newspaper Bild. Her daughter said: ‘We know that my mother had something to do with Auschwitz. We have tried to talk with her about it but her memory doesn’t really function any more.’ Tortured: Prisoners look out from behind a barbed wire enclosure at the Dachau concentration camp in Germany in 1945 Another SS woman has been identified as Gisela S. Now 90, she lives in a care home in northern Germany. She too worked at Auschwitz. Charlotte S, 94, was a guard at the women’s concentration camp of Ravensbruck where diarist Anne Frank was briefly incarcerated before being sent to her death at Belsen. Ravensbruck held mainly women and Charlotte S is said to have been a terrifying figure who beat up  prisoners and unleashed her Alsatian dog on them. Tried in Communist East Germany after the war, she was locked up for 15 months for attacking prisoners and stealing from them, but this time prosecutors hope to charge her with accessory to murder. A man on the list is Oskar Groening, cleared of war crimes in 1948. He served in Auschwitz as a clerk sorting through the clothes and possessions of the victims. Survivors: French prisoners pictured when the Nazi concentration camp of Dachau, near Munich, was liberated by Allied troops at the end of April 1945 Work: Children are seen behind barbed wire in Auschwitz He said: 'I was an official in the prisoners' possessions administration which basically involved removing the money, jewels and other valuables from the inmates, registering it and sending it back to Berlin. 'They had diamonds and gold worth millions and it was my duty to make sure all of it got to Berlin. 'It was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight to the gas chamber, although some believed they were only going to be showered before going to work. On trial: Oskar Groening, now 92, pictured in his S.S. uniform when he served in Auschwitz, has been deemed fit to stand trial for his role as an accomplice to mass murder at the camp 'Many Jews knew they were going to die. One time a drunken SS man discovered a crying baby on the platform. He grabbed the waif by its legs and smashed its head against the side of a truck. My blood froze when I saw it.' He claims he applied for a transfer and fought in Belgium until his capture. He, too, now faces an  indictment of complicity to commit mass murder. On one night in January 1943 he saw for the first time how the Jews were actually gassed. 'It was in a half-built farmyard near to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. A gas chamber was built there. We were searching the wood nearby for prisoners who had escaped,' he went on. 'There were more than 100 prisoners and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the chamber and the door was shut. 'Then a sergeant with a gasmask went to a hole in the wall and from a tin shook Zyklon B gas pellets inside. 'In that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo, a choir of madness. These cries I have ringing in my ears to this day. 'I again made an application for a transfer and at the end of October 1944 I was shipped to the Belgian Ardennes where I served with a fighting unit until capture. But you can imagine that down the years I have heard the cries of the dead in my dreams and in every waking moment. I will never be free of them. 'I have never been back there because of my shame. This guilt will never leave me. I can only plead for forgiveness and pray for atonement.' He, too, is in the eye of prosecutors who believe him to be worthy of an indictment of guilty of complicity to mass murder. Notorious: Groening was responsible for guarding the possessions of the doomed arrivals as they stepped off the trains bringing them to Auschwitz (pictured) in Poland. He claims he committed no crimes at the complex"

So far multiple tips from people have turned up nothing, she said. 'There's really not a whole lot to go on,' she said. 'We have searched the area and have been responding to tips but we really don't have a small enough area to search yet.'

Competitive bidding would have cut costs on a standard power wheelchair by nearly $1,000, the report says. A standard power wheelchair costs the federal health insurance program for seniors an average of $4,018 to lease, compared with $1,048 for suppliers to buy, the Department of Health and Human Services' internal watchdog reported. ""Medicare and its beneficiaries paid suppliers an average of $2,970 beyond the supplier's acquisition cost to perform an average of five services and cover general business costs,"" the report found. The difference was not as dramatic for more advanced wheelchairs used for physical rehabilitation patients, but at an average lease of $11,507, those chairs still cost Medicare about twice as much as the $5,880 paid by suppliers, the report found. More than 173,000 Medicare beneficiaries received power wheelchairs in the first half of 2007, at a cost of about $686 million, the report said. The cost could have been reduced considerably had Congress not delayed a planned system of competitive bidding for what Medicare classifies as ""durable medical equipment,"" such as wheelchairs and oxygen tanks, the report said. Competitive bidding would have cut Medicare's average cost of a standard power wheelchair by nearly $1,000, the inspector general found. ""Medicare and beneficiary payments under the Competitive Bidding Acquisition Program would have decreased by an average of 26 percent across all included categories of [durable medical equipment], saving up to an estimated $1 billion annually,"" the report found. ""However, Congress delayed the program and exempted complex rehabilitation power wheelchairs from future competitive bidding."" Medicare's annual budget for 2008 was $444 billion. In January, it cut its payments to suppliers by 9.5 percent to make up for what it thought competitive bidding would have saved taxpayers, according to the report. In July, a CNN investigation found that a patient and taxpayers were billed about $1,200 over four years for a nonmotorized chair, while a nearly identical chair could be bought from the same supplier for $349. The issue has become controversial as the Obama administration tries to overhaul the U.S. health care system and rein in the cost of Medicare. Administration officials want to require competitive bids for items such as wheelchairs. But the American Association for Homecare, which represents many in the durable equipment industry, said the bidding program would reduce patient choice, limit access to home medical care and drive up Medicare costs by requiring more hospital stays."

Exit polls suggest el-Sisi won 95.3% of the vote, while opponent Hamdeen Sabahy garnered only 4.7%, according to data from the Egyptian Center for Public Opinion Research and the Egyptian TV channel MBC Masr. Egypt's state-run Ahram Online news agency reported an even more lopsided margin, based on unofficial results, with Sabahy only getting 3.5% of the vote. The final results will be announced by Saturday or Sunday, according to the same agency. Sabahy, el-Sisi's lone competitor, conceded defeat in a press conference Thursday, acknowledging, ""It is time to respect the people's choice and admit my loss."" He didn't embrace the process -- including allegations his campaign representatives were attacked and detained, that el-Sisi's representatives were allowed inside polling stations and claims of forgery -- according to Ahram. ""We cannot give any credibility or ratification to the announced numbers of turnout or results,"" Sabahy said. ""The announced results are an insult to the intelligence of the Egyptians."" Turnout at 48% despite extra day of voting The election was called amid a turbulent political year in Egypt that saw Mohamed Morsy -- the country's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak -- himself removed from power in July in a military coup. El-Sisi, who was army chief at the time, stepped down from his military post this year to run for president. Analysts have said that -- in order to demonstrate his legitimacy -- el-Sisi would want to beat the turnout rate of the 2012 presidential elections, which was 46% in the first round and increased to 51.8%. As it turned out, the country seemingly struggled to get voters to the polls this week. Officials even tacked on a third day of voting Wednesday -- a move both campaigns challenged -- in an attempt to boost turnout. Presidential Elections Commission member Tarek Shebi ended up putting the final turnout figure at 48%, according to Ahram Online -- hardly a resounding number. El-Sisi's campaign hailed the election on its official Facebook page, saying that all those involved helped ""bedazzle"" the world. ""The nation has put itself, with its great people's will, on the beginning of the right track and has stepped firmly and trustingly ... towards the future they've chosen,"" the campaign post said, according to Ahram. It is a future that -- at least for now -- will not include the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that Morsy belonged to and that has been banned and declared a terrorist organization since his ouster. To this end, interim President Adly Mansour issued a decree Thursday canceling Morsy's pardoning of 52 Islamists -- including nine Brotherhood leaders and 18 jihadists -- tied to a failed 1995 assassination attempt on Mubarak.

Three people who claim to be close to the talks said the service would come through set-top boxes, with a fourth adding that it could be an extra option added to a viewer's bill. Leading online TV company Netflix is rumoured to be in talks with cable companies about a deal which could see it become a paid on-demand service to rival HBO The move would represent a major about-face in relations between the company and TV providers, who initially saw the internet giant as a big threat to their $100billion-a-year (£62.5bn) industry. Hastings has strongly hinted at investor conferences in recent weeks about the possibility of Netflix one day being a cable channel rival to premium networks such as Time Warner's HBO. He said: 'It's not in the short term, but it's in the natural direction for us in the long term. Many (cable service providers) would like to have a competitor to HBO, and they would bid us off of HBO.' While many played off the remarks as general speculation about the future, others have suggested that at least one cable provider could experiment with the service by the end of the year. Talks are though to involve Comcast Corp and Suddenlink Communications, though Netflix will not comment on the rumours. The move would give Netflix more room to expand its subscriptions as internet capabilities stuggle to keep up with demand. The service already accounts for a third of all peak US internet traffic, using almost twice as much bandwidth as YouTube. The market potential is clear too, as in a recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers 70 per cent of those polled said they still subscribed to cable, while 41 per cent said they used Netflix. A PricewaterhouseCoopers poll in June showed that, while 41 per cent of people use Netflix, a whopping 70 per cent still subscribe to cable TV However, the world's most popular streaming service still has some way to go in order to compete in the TV market. Despite producing the award winning show House of Cards, its original content falls way behind the likes of HBO, who are behind dozens of hit series including Game of Thrones, True Blood, Boardwalk Empire and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes famously dismissed the idea that Netflix was a serious threat by equating the service to the 'Albanian Army.' It must also face down stiff competition online from the likes of Google, Apple and Amazon who are thought to have major plans in the works. Even if a deal is reached in the near-term, actually receiving Netflix through a cable provider could still take months to launch. Hastings would first need to rework his licensing deals with programmers since most existing contracts will not allow Netflix to deliver their shows on a cable box, according to a senior programming executive. Netflix is currently the world's leading internet television network with more than 37 million members in 40 countries watching more than one billion hours of TV programmes and films every month. On the back of the news Netflix shares gained almost 8 per cent in trading yesterday closing at just under $325 (£203) per share."

Data examining six regions in the Karakoram mountains in the western Himalayas, which contains 7,700 square miles (nearly 20,000 square kilometers) of glaciers, revealed more than half of them are either stable or have been advancing in recent years. French scientists observed the size and shape of ice covering 2,168 square miles (5,615 square kilometers) in central Karakoram using satellite data from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (STRM) and the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT5). Between 1999 and 2008 the glaciers gained, on average, the water equivalent of around 11 centimeters a year, according to the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Lead author, Julie Gardelle from University of Grenoble in France says explanations for this increase are still not clear, but might lie in the localized climate. ""Studies have already reported an increase in winter precipitation and a lowering of summer temperatures since the 1960s in low-altitude valleys of Karakoram,"" Gardelle said. ""Given the wide extent of high mountain Asia, we cannot expect the climate to be uniform over the whole range, so a peculiar atmospheric behavior over Karakoram may not be surprising,"" she added. The study confirms an anomaly in the region which was put forward in 2005 and contrasts with the experience of the central and eastern Himalayas where most glaciers are shrinking, say researchers. That story is one which is being repeated globally, say the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) and has been since the end of the Little Ice Age around 150 years ago. WGMS estimate that since 1980 the cumulative average thickness loss of monitored glaciers across the world has been 11.3 meters. Despite the overall picture of retreat, there are instances where glaciers are able to re-advance and Karakoram is an example, says WGMS director Michael Kemp. ""The Himalayas is the highest mountain range on Earth with the highest elevation difference. It's a huge area. So we expect regions (of it) to act a bit different,"" Kemp said. Glacier data in the wider Himalayan region hit the headlines in 2010 when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had to apologize for a ""poorly substantiated"" study they cited which claimed all Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035. Kemp told CNN at the time that the data, which found its way into their Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), was flawed, saying there were ""simply no observations available to make these sorts of statements."" But this most recent work using satellites is of great value, he says, giving a picture of what is happening in a region where data has traditionally been scarce due to its remoteness and political issues -- the Karakoram range borders India, Pakistan and China. Despite the slight gains, Gardelle says, the message on climate change remains the same. ""Global warming is far from spatially homogeneous and continuous with time. In our warming world, there are regions of the Earth where, during a few years or decades, the atmosphere is not warming or even cooling,"" Gardelle said. ""Karakoram may be one of those, but we lack consistent high elevation weather station to conclude firmly on this."""

Pearson won gold in 12.67s - quicker again than her semi final win - to defeat rival Tiffany Porter who ran 12.80, with Canada's Angela Whyte bronze in 13.02 on a day where Australia hauled in four gold. A jubilant Pearson, who had stayed silent on the sacking of coach Eric Hollingswoth earlier in the week, made a statement louder than any words could when she flew home in the final before celebrating with fans post-race. The 27-year-old capped off not only a personal milestone but a big day for Australians generally with four athletes bagging golds on day nine. Rookie high jumper Eleanor Patterson, discus thrower Dani Samuels and diver Matthew Mitcham also made their statements on the world stage. Pearson edged out her rival Tiffany Porter who ran a time of 12.80s in second place It is back-to-back gold for Pearson in her pet event the 100m hurdles Mitcham broke through to win his first Commonwealth Gold after six attempts, while discus thrower  Dani Samuels lived up to her favourites’ tag with a dominant win in the women’s event. She threw  64.88m, almost 3m ahead of her nearest competitor. Rookie high jumper, Eleanor Patterson, 18, produced a big effort to win gold in the women’s high jump final with a jump of 1.94m Australian Hannah Joye, who was also competing in the final, finished sixth with a personal best of 1.89 metres. But the day belonged to Pearson, who put all the controversy of her troubled relationship with Hollingsworth behind her when he was sacked for comments he made earlier in the week. He had said that Pearson set a bad example to younger athletes by not appearing at the team camp in Gateshead last week.

When asked how she put the sensational sacking of her coach behind her and remain so calm in the build-up to the final, Pearson said she reverted to simple tactics. 'I’ve done this a million times before. I know how to win, I know how to race. It’s just another day at the office,' she told Channel 10. 'It’s just another 100 metres with 10 hurdles in the way.

Curious, he unzipped it, and found a pile of brown bottles with cloth wicks attached by duct tape. His observant reactions might have foiled a plot to blow up 48 churches across Oklahoma. Smith next noticed an empty gas can in the bin, and a co-worker remembered seeing a motel guest with it two days earlier. They quickly reported their finds to police, leading to the arrest of a 23-year-old Illinois man who authorities now say planned to attack dozens of churches with Molotov cocktails. Gregory Arthur Weiler II, 23, of Elk Grove Village, Ill., has been charged with threatening to use an explosive or incendiary device and violating the Oklahoma Antiterrorism Act. 'I don't feel like I'm a hero or anything like that,' said. 'We were doing it because we want the public to know people can stay here and this is not a bad place.' Maintenance worker Steve Ballenger said he saw Weiler with the gas can two days earlier - and Weiler explained that he had run out of gas in his car. After Smith discovered the gas can and bag in the trash bin on Thursday October 4, the two pretended to be cleaning and went into Weiler's room. There, they found more duct tape, nylon and other items. Motel owner Ishver Patel said he considers it 'lucky' that Weiler was caught. 'He might have blown up here and innocent people get hurt,' Patel said. Police said in an affidavit that along with bomb-making materials, they found pieces of paper in Weiler's room that when assembled, contained directions for making Molotov cocktails, a list of 48 local churches and an outline of a plan to plant bombs at the churches. Weiler, who is being held without bail, has applied for a court-appointed attorney. His cousin, Johnny Meyers, has said that Weiler has struggled with mental illness but is fine when he takes his medication. Ralph Smith, a maintenance worker at the Legacy Inn & Suites, stands in front of the trash bin where he found discarded bomb-making materials Meyers said relatives believe Weiler may have stopped taking his medication before his arrest. Ministers and others at churches in Miami said they were surprised by the arrest and didn't know why he focused on their town. 'The only thing I can think of is this is the Bible belt,' said Carrol Thompson, the secretary at Immanuel Baptist Church, referring to the region's reputation for having many churches. Others expressed sympathy for Weiler, who was raised by Meyers' family after his parents committed suicide. 'Whatever bad experience he had, we don't look at him any different than anybody who needs Jesus in their lives,' said Rev. Raymond Frizzelle, of First Assembly of God, which sits across the road from the motel. At nearby First Christian Church, associate minister Gary Reed said his first reaction was disbelief, followed by compassion for Weiler. 'We pray for him and our heart goes out to somebody that's feeling very disenfranchised and has a lot of anger and resentment toward the church and our faith tells us we have to have compassion,' Reed said."

That is preposterous and beside the point. The ACA is law. End of story. The House Republicans' attempt to nullify a duly-enacted law violates the norms of our constitutional system. It is reckless economically and an egregious affront to our democratic form of government. House Republicans have every right to press their views in Congress but not to threaten to blow up the U.S. and global economy by shutting down the government and threatening public default We have elections for all three key players -- the president, the House and the Senate. If Republicans want to change the law, they must do it the old-fashioned way: Persuade the others to accept their position or win control of the White House and Senate. House Republicans lost ground in the 2012 elections, lost the national vote for the House by over a million votes and retained a majority only because of favorable districting. Obama won re-election by 3.9 percentage points and got an overwhelming victory in the Electoral College. Senate Democrats retained their majority despite having to defend more than twice as many seats as the Republicans. House Republicans represent a distinct minority of public sentiment. They carelessly generalize from the echo chambers of their safe districts to the national electorate. Polls show a majority of the public opposed to shutting down the government to kill or amend Obamacare. A majority of Americans also oppose its repeal or defunding. Moreover, a significant portion of those who don't like the law say it doesn't go far enough. But public opinion doesn't matter at this point. The Constitution provides for an orderly process of making laws and building agreement between chambers of Congress and branches of government. Blackmail, extortion, hostage-taking and brinksmanship are the tools of terrorists, not legislators. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Mann."

The death rate at two hospitals fell by 15 per cent after nurses were given electronic devices in place of handwritten paper notes to record patients’ heart rates and breathing. Researchers calculated that 750 deaths were prevented in a year at the two hospitals, Queen Alexandria in Portsmouth and University Hospital in Coventry. At present, nurses are meant to measure patients’ heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and take certain other readings and note them down on a board at the end of the bed: There is no suggestion that these nurses have illegible handwriting (File photo) Across the NHS, this means 37,000 deaths could be avoided if nurses were given the devices rather than relying on traditional handwritten notes from nurses. At present, nurses are meant to measure patients’ heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and take certain other readings and note them down on a board at the end of the bed. Often these readings aren’t taken regularly enough and in some patients there are gaps of between eight and 12 hours between measures. In other cases, nurses handwriting is illegible or they don’t note down all the figures meaning it is not clear for their colleagues to monitor patients. To address the problem of poor handwriting, hand-held devices were given to nurses at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth (above) To address the problem, hand-held devices were given to nurses at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth in 2005 and at University Hospitals in Coventry in 2007. They were handed either iPhones or iPads – small computers – installed with an app that takes patients readings and reminds nurses when they are next needed. An alert flashes up on the screen if patients are deteriorating and in some cases they will urge nurses to summon a doctor. Researchers compared the death rates for every year from 2004 – before the devices were used – to 2010. They annual death rates fell by 397 at Portsmouth and by 372 deaths at University Hospitals Coventry in 2010 compared to 2004. Dr Paul Schmidt of Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, one of the leaders of the project, said: ‘Observing patients and making accurate records provides a safety net to guard against their deterioration. ‘We believed traditional paper charts were not doing the job well enough so we designed an electronic system to support staff. This study shows its introduction was followed by a significant drop in deaths.” Dr Duncan Watson of University Hospital Coventry, who also worked on the project, said: ‘This technology improves the performance of routine but important tasks and frees up clinical staff to do what only human beings can do – care for patients.” Many of the deaths avoided would have occurred in the elderly who had developed pneumonia or infections which would otherwise have been spotted too late. Typically they cost around £500,000 to roll out across a medium-sized hospital trust and about 40 are now using them in at leat one department."

The latest blast killed at least 14 with 28 wounded, some severely. A day earlier, an explosion reported as being detonated by a female ""black widow"" suicide bomber saw 17 killed and dozens wounded in the city's main railway station. Umarov, 49, is the Chechen jihadist leader blamed for the two suicide bombings in Volgograd in Russia over Christmas Russian emergency workers and investigators at the site of the wreckage of a trolleybus after an attack by a suicide bomber The latest explosion was said by law enforcement officials to have been  caused by a man detonating a bomb in a crowded trolley bus packed with early morning commuters. At least 14 people were killed and 28 wounded in the bombing 'The explosives were detonated by a male suicide bomber, fragments of whose body have been found and sent for DNA testing to identify him,' said Vladimir Markin, spokesman for the Russian Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI. 'According to preliminary information, the explosive device was the equivalent of at least 4 kg of TNT, and like the explosive device used at the railway station, it was stuffed with metal filings. It was not immediately clear why he is suspected. The blasts are causing panic in the city, and deep concern all over Russia as people prepare to celebrate the New Year. 'Since both explosive devices contained identical metal filings, this confirms the investigation's theory that two terrorist attacks are linked.' Security officials today named a suspected perpetrator of the trolley bus explosion as Pavel Pechenkin, from the Volga River republic of Mariy El. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the blasts, but they underscored vulnerability to bombings and raised fears of attacks by Islamist insurgents whose leader has called on militants to prevent Russia hosting the Olympics Devastating: At least 14 people were killed when a bomb exploded on a packed trolleybus on Monday in Russia Suicide bombing: At least 14 passengers on a trolley bus have been killed in the Russian city of Volgograd Emergency Ministry officers working at the site of the explosion He apparently joined a illegal armed band in spring 2012 after converting to Islam and changing his name to Ansar Ar-Rusi. A DNA test is underway to confirm his identity. President Vladamir Putin held a crisis summit with the country's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to discuss the double bombing. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, speaks during a meeting to discuss the blasts with Premier Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow's Kremlin Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) has ordered security to be stepped up across the whole of Russia He ordered security to be stepped up across all nine time zones in Russia, and especially around fear-stricken Volgograd, a city known as Stalingrad in the Soviet era. President Putin also ordered the head of Russian secret services Alexander Bortnikov to fly to Volgograd  amid fears of a campaign of terror aimed at disrupting preparations for the Sochi Winter Olympics in February. Flowers placed at the site of the train station explosion Sochi is around 425 miles from Volgograd. While forensic work is underway, security officials already suspect the mayhem was unleashed by followers of Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov who earlier this year threatened to hit  civilian targets and urged followed to ""to their utmost to derail"" the Olympics. Among the wounded in Monday's blast was a one year old child. Television footage of the scene, near a market in the Dzerzhinsky region of the city, showed debris strewn across the street around the blackened shell of the trolleybus. The vehicle's roof was blown out  by the force of the explosion which also smashed windows in nearby houses. Speaking to RT, Sergey Avdienko, retired police colonel and former Interpol officer, said the attacks are: 'Exactly a part of the same chain, including the past explosion in October, the people behind it are the same. 'It’s quite clear who is behind these attacks – it’s people from a place fairly close to Volgograd; I’m speaking about the Caucasus, where radical Islamic groups thrive. 'The entire point of doing this, especially on the cusp of the New Year, is to intimidate the population and to destabilise the situation in the country as well, particularly in view of the coming Olympic Games that are going to take place in Sochi, which is about 700 kilometers from Volgograd. Tragic: Monday's shocking blast (pictured) came a day after a suicide bombing killed at least 17 people in the same Russian city 'The choice of this place for suicide attacks is obvious.' The RT also reported that more than 600 people have volunteered to give blood at the Volgograd regional blood bank. At least 14 people have been killed and 22 injured in an explosion on a packed trolleybus in Russia's Volgograd city Despite an overabundance of blood, people have continued to volunteer and a queue stretches outside the building. The Spiritual Administration of Muslims in Moscow is also keen to help and has launched a fundraiser to collect money for the families of the bombing victims. Volunteers from the administration are also planning to go to Volgograd 'to provide help and moral support.' The blast was caused by an explosive device in the vehicles passenger cabin, said Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee. The railway station blast was initially said to have been caused by a Siberian-born woman who was named as Oksana Aslanova who had been married to two different Islamists killed in battles with federal forces. The woman was on the federal wanted list and she had been on the run for almost two years. Today the Investigative Committee said they were also looking at evidence a man was closely involved in the devastating ""terror act"". Female suicide bombers are often referred to in Russia as ""black widows"" -- women who seek to avenge the deaths of their family members in the fighting by targeting Russian civilians.

Dr Richard Keller, 56, of Andover, Massachusetts, 'knowingly received films depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct', according to the U.S. attorney's office. Keller was the medical director at Phillips Academy for almost 20 years before leaving in 2011. Phillips Academy is a highly prestigious boarding school for students in grades nine to 12 and the oldest incorporated academy in the United States, established in 1778 by Samuel Phillips, Jr. Andover has educated two American presidents, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Keller is also a pediatrics instructor at Harvard Medical School. In a statement released this afternoon, federal prosecutors said Keller 'purchased and ordered over 50 DVDs of child pornography online. 'At this time, more than 500 photographs and between 60 – 100 DVDs have been recovered during an ongoing search of Dr Keller’s home today.' The case began with an investigation of an oversea's movie production company that offered films featuring naked young boys having food fights, wrestling, showering together and playing Twister. When investigators accessed the company website and reviewed film previews and summaries, one of the videos was described as: 'We bring you action-packed discs of ooey-gooey slippery goodness. This two set disc features (name) and his buddies going commando in a very unique way. 'They're sweet enough but that didn't stop them from breaking out sugary cupcakes and giving you a whole new perspective on nudist food fighting.' An investigation into the pediatric endocrinologist's account showed that between January 2009 and July 2011, he ordered titles on 19 separate occasions, spending $2,695. On five of the 19 occasions, the pornographic material was sent to Phillips Academy's student health center, according to the arrest warrant. Concerns: Keller was placed on immediate leave from Boston Children's Hospital Boston pending an investigation Famous boarding school: Keller worked at prestigious Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for almost 20 years before he left last year It also states that 60 to 100 DVDs and 500 high-gloss images were seized from his bedroom. If Keller is convicted of all charges, he faces up to 20 years in prison and will be placed on the sex offender's register for life. Children’s Hospital spokesman Rob Graham released this statement: 'Providing safe and appropriate care in a safe and protective environment is the absolute paramount priority for Boston Children’s Hospital. 'When the hospital learned of the allegations against Dr Richard Keller earlier today, he was immediately put on administrative leave pending results of the investigation by the US Attorney’s Office. We will cooperate fully with the US Attorney’s Office and all other involved regulatory and legal authorities. 'No complaints or concerns have been expressed by any patients or family members about the care Dr Keller provided while he was at Children's.' Because Keller would have been in contact with countless minors through the nature of his work, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said: 'Members of the public who have questions, concerns or information regarding this case should call 617-748-3274, and messages will be promptly returned.'"

The club's annual autumn meeting saw members vote 85 per cent in favour of the change in membership rules that have stood for its 260-year history. After the vote Peter Dawson, chief executive of the R&A, said: 'The R&A is now a mixed-sex club. The Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews has voted 85 per cent in favour of allowing women members Of the 2,400 men who make up the global R&A membership, about two-thirds took the opportunity to make history at the club. 'This is an important and positive day in the history of the R&A Golf Club,' Dawson said. 'The R&A has served the sport of golf well for 260 years and I am confident that the club will continue to do so in future with the support of all its members, both women and men.' Dawson confirmed a 'significant' number of women in prominent positions within the golfing community will be fast-tracked into membership at the exclusive club. Sports minister Helen Grant called on other clubs with similar restrictions to follow the R&A's lead. 'I am pleased that the members of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews have voted in favour of admitting women members,' she said. 'This is positive news for the sport and I hope we will now see other golf clubs that still have outdated same sex policies follow suit. Peter Dawson, chief executive of the R&A, says 'The R&A is now a mixed-sex club.' 'With golf in the next Olympics there is a huge opportunity for the sport to grow and this sends out the right inclusive message that golf is for everyone.' Cabinet Secretary for Sport and Equalities Shona Robison also praised the decision, adding: 'In the week before Scotland welcomes golf fans from across the world for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, this decision by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews to admit women members is another step on the road to full equality in sport and society. 'This decision by the world's most exclusive and prestigious golf club sees real progress towards making golf a more equal sport, which is very important. 'We firmly believe that there should be no barriers at all to being involved in sport with everyone able to participate in and enjoy sport - whoever they are and whatever their background. I hope this welcome development leads to the few remaining single-gender golf clubs to take a similar path.' When the vote was announced in March, Dawson insisted it was not intended to place pressure on the three male-only clubs on the Open Championship rota, but such an interpretation is unavoidable. Pressure from sponsors had been mounting, with HSBC's global head of sponsorship and events Giles Morgan saying in January that: ''The R&A are clear that it's a very uneasy position for the bank.' Sweden's Annika Sorenstam tees off on the 18th at St Andrews in the 2007 Women's British Open pro-am Morgan said on Thursday: 'As a partner of the R&A and a long-term international sponsor of golf, we welcome this news with open arms. 'HSBC is committed to growing the game at all levels and fundamental to this is our commitment to the value of diversity and our support of women's golf which is a cornerstone of our global golf portfolio. 'As a patron of the oldest and most prestigious of all major championships, we are proud to be a partner of The Open Championship which creates a centre of gravity in our global golf portfolio. We look forward to continuing this successful partnership at St Andrews in 2015 for what promises to be the start of a new era.' Muirfield, Royal Troon and Royal St George's are the three clubs on the 10-strong rota with male-only membership policies, although Troon feels it should not be directly compared to the other two as it shares its facilities with The Ladies Golf Club Troon. Muirfield, which is owned and run by The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, is reviewing its membership criteria with a report to be completed by March 2015, while Royal St George's is also 'considering its position' as a single-sex club."

But by April of next year, the planes named Lisa Marie and Hound Dog II could be gone. Elvis Presley Enterprises, which operates Graceland, has notified the planes' owners that they should prepare to remove the jets early next year. The planes, owned by the OKC Partnership in Memphis, have been a tourist attraction since the mid-1980s. On the move?: The Lisa Marie, one of two jets once owned by late singer Elvis Presley, at Graceland Flying visit: The two planes are a huge tourist attraction for Elvis fans heading to Graceland OKC Partnership and Graceland agreed to bring them to Graceland, with OKC getting a share of ticket sales at the mansion. In a letter to OKC Partnership's KG Coker, Elvis Presley Enterprises CEO Jack Soden said the company was ending the agreement and asked Coker to remove the planes and restore the site by April 26, 2015. The larger plane, a Convair 880 named Lisa Marie, is like a customised flying limousine, with a large bed, a stereo system, conference room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. It was renovated after Presley bought it from Delta Air Lines. Presley took his first flight on it in November 1975. Tourist attraction: The Hound Dog II plane which was once used by the King of Rock and Roll Elvis Presley Home sweet home: Elvis poses outside Graceland in 1957 The smaller jet, a JetStar named the Hound Dog II, was also used by Presley. Coker, 76, says OKC may sell the planes if they're removed from Graceland, but he still hopes to negotiate a deal to keep the planes there. ‘I would love to see the aeroplanes stay where they are forever,’ he said. ‘Millions of fans have toured those airplanes and there's a real connection between fans and those airplanes. Those aeroplanes are part of the Elvis experience.’ Perfectly preserved: The seats inside the Lisa Marie jet are covered in plastic wrapping KG Coker, whose OKC Partnership owns two airplanes once owned and used by Elvis Presley, stands behind a model of one of the planes in his home in Memphis Dedicated Elvis fan Paul Fivelson of Algonquin, Illinois, said he expects many fans will be upset to hear the planes may be leaving. ‘The people who come to Memphis for Elvis Week like seeing those planes there because it's just part of the whole aura of what Elvis was about,’ he said. ‘It would be kind of blasphemous to take them away, and I think there are probably a lot of fans who will feel the same way.’ The disclosure also raises questions about the future use of the site where the airplanes now sit, across the street from Presley's long-time home. Big draw: Thousands of Elvis fans flock to Graceland every year to see the planes Luxury jet: Inside the Hound Dog II plane, which could be removed from Graceland Elvis Presley Enterprises declined to comment. In November, New York-based Authentic Brands Group bought Elvis Presley Enterprises and the licensing and merchandising rights for Presley's music and image from CORE Media Group. As part of the deal, Joel Weinshanker, founder of the National Entertainment Collectibles Association, acquired the operating rights to Graceland, which attracts about 500,000 visitors each year. Earlier this year, Elvis Presley Enterprises announced plans to build a 450-room hotel, theatre and restaurant, with a projected opening date of August 2015. Their plan was approved Tuesday by the Memphis City Council. Today, Graceland visitors can buy a ticket that includes a tour of Presley's home-turned-museum and the interior of the two airplanes. At one point, after the planes were sold following the singer's death, the Lisa Marie was owned by Raymond Zimmerman, owner of the Service Merchandise chain, according to Coker. The Hound Dog II was in the hands of Hustler head Larry Flynt for a time, Coker said. OKC Partnership eventually bought the planes and the Lisa Marie was installed at Graceland in 1984. The Hound Dog II came later."

Felix Magath has declared that he wouldn’t sign Brazilian superstar Neymar, even if he had the chance to get him for free. Despite the club playing Championship football next season, Magath sees no role at Craven Cottage for one of the best players in the world. The Fulham manager appeared on Germany’s major TV channel ZDF after Argentina’s victory over Switzerland, to give his own expert view on the World Cup. Talking to former Bayern Munich star Hasan Salihamidaic, the German coach said that he didn’t like players like Neymar. VIDEO scroll down to watch Thomas Muller leading Germany's training Star of the show: Neymar has been one of Brazil's key men - but he would not get in Felix Magath's team Going alone: Neymar scores a lot of individual goals - according to Magath 'I like team players. Players like Neymar, where it’s all about the individual scoring goals... I don’t know,' said Magath, before breaking into sheepish grin, 'I probably wouldn’t even take him for free'. Salihamidaic’s reaction was one of visible shock, and the Bosnian couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Even as a tongue-in-cheek remark, it was a bold claim from Magath, who faces the mammoth task of reshaping Fulham’s squad for the Championship following their relegation in May. Team player: Magath is a fan of players like Germany's Thomas Muller Midfield master: Magath is also a fan of Bastian Schweinsteiger He did offer optimistic Fulham fans a glimmer of hope though, saying: 'If Neymar wins the World Cup with Brazil, then maybe I’d consider it.' Happily for the Craven Cottage faithful, Magath’s infamous love of the transfer market has not disappeared entirely. Asked which World Cup stars he would like to bring to Fulham, Magath said he thought Manuel Neuer had been outstanding, and that he’d always welcome Thomas Muller. With those two transfers under his belt, perhaps Fulham wouldn’t even need Neymar to guarantee promotion next season. Making his mark: Magath will look to lead Fulham back to the Premer League at the first attempt Magath was also full of praise for Bastian Schweinsteiger, saying he was the 'right man' for Germany’s midfield. He claimed that the Bayern Munich player was a superior choice to Real Madrid’s Sami Khedira. 'Khedira can’t play the same leading role at the moment,' he said. The Fulham boss then laid into Germany coach Joachim Low, saying that he had to stop playing captain Phillipp Lahm in midfield. 'Phillipp wants to play there, but it’s not about that. It’s about the team. For this team, he is more urgently needed as a left back. Benedikt Hoewedes can’t fulfil that role properly at the moment'. VIDEO Neymar fit for Brazil"

A lab test confirms DNA evidence taken from the body of a murder victim matches Albert DeSalvo, who at one point confessed to being the Boston Strangler, Massachusetts authorities said Friday. The evidence was taken after Mary Sullivan, 19, was sexually assaulted and strangled to death on January 4, 1964, in her Charles Street apartment in Boston. DeSalvo had confessed to that crime and about a dozen other murders police attributed to the Boston Strangler. However, he recanted his admissions and was never convicted of any of them before his death. Although many continued to believe DeSalvo was the Boston Strangler despite his retraction, others expressed doubts. Now, however, there is an ""unprecedented level of certainty"" that DeSalvo raped and killed Sullivan, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said in a news release Friday. Officials announced the results after notifying Sullivan's family of the findings, the release said. See more: City of fear, photos from the Boston Strangler era ""Questions that Mary's family asked for almost 50 years have finally been answered. They, and the families of all homicide victims, should know that we will never stop working to find justice, accountability, and closure on their behalf,"" Conley said. Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis credited ""a relentless cold case squad"" who ""refused to give up, waiting until science met good police work to solve this case."" DeSalvo was stabbed to death in 1973 while serving a life prison term for unrelated rapes. Solving a murder with DNA Conley said earlier this month that scientists had tried several times in the late 1990s and early 2000s to isolate DNA evidence from semen found in Sullivan's body and on a blanket. They resumed their efforts last year, after scientific advances had led to a laboratory successfully salvaging DNA from decades-old material. Boston Police Crime Laboratory technicians were able to extract DNA profiles from both sets of samples, and those DNA profiles matched one another, the news release says. The DNA profile was uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System. Known as CODIS, it stores the DNA profiles of millions of known offenders, the release says. But there was no match. That ruled out at least one man who earlier been an unofficial suspect in Sullivan's slaying, it says. Investigators then went on a search for any other evidence that might contain DeSalvo's DNA. But each place that might have had suitable samples -- like the Department of Correction, the Massachusetts State Police and others -- did not. Knowing Y chromosomes are passed down ""almost unchanged"" from father to son, Boston Police retrieved a water bottle that one of DeSalvo's nephews drank from and threw away. Police revealed this action earlier in July. Although the DNA recovered from the bottle was a ""familial match"" with the genetic material preserved from Sullivan's murder, Conley said at that time that it wasn't enough to close the case with certainty. It did, however, lead to a judge approving DeSalvo's exhumation so a DNA sample could be taken directly from him. On July 12, DeSalvo's grave was excavated and his remains were transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Comparisons were made, officials said, and the match was confirmed."

Mr Justice Charles told peers that open scrutiny of the controversial court’s hearings would improve the behaviour of everyone taking part, including judges. He brushed aside arguments that the Court of Protection – which makes decisions about the medical treatment, care and property of those who cannot decide for themselves – has a first duty to protect the privacy of families and individuals who come before it. The Court of Protection is part of the High Court and analyses issues relating to sick and vulnerable people ‘The impact of proceedings having more sunlight let in, more transparency, outweighs the difficulties that in some cases some people may have in having their privacy invaded,’ the judge said. He also told peers the court’s routine secrecy may break human rights laws, that judges have been reluctant even to let the public know the outcome of the court’s cases, and that some judges and legal figures remain firmly opposed to letting outsiders know what goes on in its hearings. The call for open reporting of cases follows months of growing controversy. Set up six years ago under Labour’s Mental Capacity Act, the court can order people to be confined to care homes or decide whether desperately sick patients should die or be treated. One doctor told the court that the woman's physical and mental problems should lessen, and be easier to treat, once the baby was born In April, the Daily Mail revealed that a Court of Protection judge had sent Wanda Maddocks, 50, to jail in secret. Miss Maddocks was sentenced to five months for defying the court by trying to free her father from a care home where she thought his life was in danger. Sir James Munby, head of the family courts, has repeatedly called for more openness. Mr Justice Charles yesterday threw his weight behind Sir James at the Lords inquiry into the Mental Capacity Act’s workings. Greater openness would ‘improve the performance of all involved in the court process’, he told peers. ‘I don’t exclude judges from that.’"

Ketan Somaia, 52, wooed his victims with luxury trips on private Learjets, champagne parties, extravagant dinners and expenses paid trips to Dubai, Kenya and South Africa. The Kenyan businessman, dubbed ‘King Con’, boasted about his connections to the billionaire Hinduja brothers while showing off his plush office in Mayfair and a palatial home in the exclusive north London suburb of Hadley Wood. In reality Somaia was shamelessly exploiting his unwitting victims to get his hands on their money to sustain his luxurious lifestyle and prop up his failing businesses. Even after his arrest Somaia continued to live in a manner that ‘most can only dream of’, dining at the five-star Dorchester hotel in Mayfair and the exclusive East India Men’s Club, and sending his teenage daughter to a finishing school in Switzerland. Somaia was convicted of nine counts of fraud after a private prosecution launched by his victim and former friend Murli Mirchandani at the Old Bailey. Mr Mirchandani lost nearly $20million between 1999 and 2000 while a second investor Dilip Shah lost 200,000 dollars. Sentencing Somaia, Judge Richard Hone QC said: ‘Your fraudulent conduct involved obtaining $19.7million. At the prevailing exchange rates that represents approximately £13.5million. ‘It is apparent from the evidence that your Dolphin Group of companies was in serious trouble at the time of the economic downturn at the end of 1999. ‘I am satisfied the money you took as loans and investments were never invested as you said they would be but were used by you either for your own purposes or to prop up your failing companies. ‘You were fundamentally dishonest in your dealings with both Murli Mirchandani and Dilip Shah. You breached their trust in you in a callous, immoral and flagrant manner. Influence: All four of the billionaire Hinduja brothers who Ketan Somaia, dubbed King Con, claimed to know ‘But for your admitted ill health I would have had no hesitation in passing a sentence of ten years imprisonment. However I think some allowance should be made though in my judgement you are your own worst enemy in that respect, having failed to take medication and failed to adhere to your doctor’s advice.’ Defence barrister James Woods QC had attempted to delay sentence again after arguing Somaia needed another operation. Mr Woods also claimed that Somaia had only a 20 per cent chance of surviving the next five years because of his heart and kidney problems. Somaia was able to pull off the scams because his victims accepted his personal guarantees that ‘my word is my bond’. He gave the impression of being a successful businessman with his smooth, charming, impressive and persuasive exterior. Somaia bragged that he was a friend of the billionaire Hinduja brothers and owned assets worth $500million in banking and hotels. Exclusive: Hadley Wood in north London where Ketan Somaia owned a palatial home (file picture) He could boast a link to Lord Parkinson through Dolphin Holdings, part of a business empire built up by Somaia that collapsed in 2001. Mr Mirchandani heard of his business prowess at a cocktail party and was quickly bewitched by Somaia’s offer of a lucrative partnership. Somaia treated him to dinners at Annabel’s nightclub in London and all expenses paid trips to South Africa and Dubai and flaunted his lavish home in Hadley Wood, north London. His scam began with a plea for a short term loan of $865,000 to buy shares in Delphis Bank Mauritius, guaranteeing repayment in four months. Two days later he convinced Mr Mirchandani to hand over $7.5million to buy a ten per cent stake in the bank. In July Mr Mirchandani transferred another $2.5million to buy a stake in another company which Somaia claimed would double in value within three years. The following month Mr Mirchandani thought he was paying $2.775million for a 50 per cent interest in the Diamond Mining Corporation of Liberia, which Somaia claimed would treble in value within nine months. Two weeks later Mr Mirchandani transferred another $3million to Somaia to help purchase a bank in Tanzania with a guaranteed profit of 20 per cent and full repayment within 120 days at 15 per cent interest. Somaia built up a feeling of ‘fevered excitement’ in his victim with false opportunities of being his business partner, said prosecutor William Boyce QC. Justice: Somaia was convicted of nine counts after a trial at the Old Bailey In October 1999 Somaia invited Mr Mirchandani to a meeting at his office in Brook Street, Mayfair and offered him the chance to invest in a hotel group in South Africa. Mr Mirchandani paid $1.85million for a 50 per cent interest in the deal but never received any paper work confirming his investment. The duped businessman became increasingly worried about his investments after Somaia asked for two loans of £1million at 15 per cent interest and $1.5million at 18 per cent interest in November 1999. Somaia claimed he was having ‘cash flow problems’ but would personally guarantee the loans.The following month he invited Mr Mirchandani on another ‘no expenses spared’ trip to South Africa in December. By March 2000 Mr Mirchandani was pressing Somaia for repayment but still felt some obligation because of Somaia’s previous generosity. Victim Murli Mirchandani leaving the Old Bailey after giving evidence during the trial in June. He lost nearly $20million between 1999 and 2000 As a result he agreed to give the conman a further loan of £1million to be repaid within 30 days. He never received the money back but two months later Somaia again asked for another loan during a trip to Mauritius. Mr Mirchandani agreed to give him another $1million on condition everything was repaid by September 2000 before finally pulling the plug. Somaia then asked Dilip Shah for ‘emergency funding’ with an return of 25 per cent but Mr Shah could only afford $200,000. In return he was given ten million shares in Delphis Bank Mauritius but when he tried to cash them in a year later he was told they were worthless. Mr Mirchandani - who himself claims to be worth more than $120million - finally launched a private prosecution in the autumn of 2011 while Somaia was in London. Somaia claimed in his defence that Mr Mirchandani gave him the money knowing the risk it might be lost, and said the gamble had not paid off. The court heard Somaia also received around $2million from Surajit Sen in 1997 and owed a total of $15million to another businessman, referred to as ‘Mr Bose’, by April 2001. Somaia made the first repayment of $2million to Mr Bose but failed to pay any more of the money back. Somaia, of Bayswater, west London, was found guilty of eight charges of obtaining money transfers by deception from Mr Mirchandani between 23 June 1999 and 6 May 2000 and one charge of obtaining money transfers by deception from Mr Shah on 10 August 2000. He was acquitted of two counts of obtaining money by deception from Mr Mirchandani amounting to $3.5m. In a statement released following conviction, Mr Mirchandani said: ‘I feel great relief that Mr Somaia has finally been brought to justice. ‘Fourteen years ago, I was a self-made businessman with a thriving business to hand over to my children. When I met Mr Somaia, I trusted him implicitly. ‘He seemed to me to be a very successful and wealthy businessman and I thought that I could benefit from doing business with him. I now bitterly regret my misplaced trust. He has stolen US$19.5 million from me which has caused considerable harm to my business. ‘His actions have undermined my trust in people and had a detrimental effect on my health. I have spent the last fourteen years trying to rebuild my businesses at the same time as trying to hold Mr Somaia to account for his actions. ‘By bringing a private prosecution, I have made sure that his conduct is seen for what it is: criminal and dishonest. Securing a conviction against Mr Somaia will not undo the harm he has caused and the pain he has inflicted upon me and my family but knowing that he has been brought to justice helps bring us some closure.’ Michael O’Kane, Head of Business Crime at legal firm Peters & Peters said: ’Mr Murli Mirchandani approached Peters & Peters in 2009 with a view to bringing Mr Somaia to justice. ‘Peters & Peters helped Mr Mirchandani to mount his own private prosecution which is, to our knowledge, the largest private prosecution brought by an individual in the UK to date.’"

With the president escaping to Asia for a critical foreign trip after last week's bruising losses for his party, White House officials are signaling Obama will take a hard-nosed approach with Congress when he returns to Washington. Obama is ""nearing a final decision"" on issuing an executive order bringing reforms to U.S. immigration policy, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters at a briefing in Naypyitaw, Myanmar. Earnest reiterated the President's goal to act on the issue by the end of the year. Immigration reform advocates working with the administration on the expected executive action anticipate Obama will expand his policy of deferred deportation for undocumented children to their families, a move that may provide enforcement relief to as many as five million people. The expected incoming Senate majority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has described such a move as a ""poison pill"" that would damage relations with the new Republican Congress coming into power in January. Aides to the President brush off those GOP warnings, noting threats from Republican leaders to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Obama has vowed he will never sign that repeal legislation into law. ""Repealing Obamacare is also a poison pill,"" White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer said. Obama seeks new Syria strategy review Earnest cited the President's new climate change deal with China as another area where Obama can pursue his own agenda without Congress. Asked whether the administration believes the United States can meet the agreement's carbon emission requirements without congressional involvement, Earnest said simply, ""we do."" Administration officials believe the United States is well on its way to holding up its end of the climate deal, citing Obama's executive decisions to raise fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as well as new rules that set tougher emission requirements for power plants. In his own response to the climate agreement, McConnell questioned whether China would be as ambitious. ""I read the agreement - requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states around the country,"" the Kentucky Republican said. Will Congress kill an Iran nuclear deal? China would have to make ""significant"" changes in meeting its energy needs in order to comply with the deal, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said. On another top priority for Republicans, passage of legislation to accelerate completion of the contested Keystone oil pipeline, Earnest suggested the President is warming up his veto pen. Earnest declined to definitively say Obama would veto such legislation. But he quickly added the President has taken a ""dim view"" of similar bills in the past. Top White House officials insist the President remains interested in working with Republicans on a range of common interests, from tax reform to infrastructure spending. Obama is visiting Myanmar for the second time in two years to attend the ASEAN economic summit while checking in on democratic reform efforts in the nation also known as Burma. Top Congressional Republicans slam U.S.-China climate deal Making the transformation from a closed-off military state to a parliamentary democracy, Myanmar happens to be a beneficiary of bipartisan cooperation on Capitol Hill. McConnell, who was originally a sponsor of sanctions on Myanmar's military leadership, was praised by Rhodes in Naypyitaw for his role in winding down those economic penalties. ""Senator McConnell has been a champion of democracy here in Burma,"" Rhodes volunteered to reporters. What to expect from the lame duck Congress"

Home Secretary Theresa May killed the agency off earlier this year, condemning it as a ‘troubled’ organisation dogged by years of catastrophic failure. Analysis of the UKBA’s accounts reveal it squandered millions on empty buildings, giving money to asylum seekers who were not entitled to it and booking flights for people who were not deported. The UK Border Agency was broken up after it emerged the backlog of immigration cases would take 24 years to clear The agency was repeatedly criticised for its failure to get a grip on Britain’s immigration backlog. Mrs May lost patience in March after it emerged there were 321,726 outstanding cases involving immigrants, which would take until 2037 to clear. But behind the scenes a string of blunders meant the agency was wasting millions on buildings, plane tickets and compensation. The agency’s accounts reveal how the money was written off under the heading of 'losses and special payments'. In 2012-13 the agency wrote off £42.9million, a significant increase on the £25.1million wasted in the year before. In 2010-11, a total of £30.3million was written off. Home Secretary Theresa May said the agency had been 'troubled' and had a 'closed, secretive and defensive culture' Amongst the money that was written off in the last three years were: It included £2.5million in 2012-13 alone booking flights for failed asylum seekers who did not leave the country because they were granted the right to appeal. A doomed plan to build an immigration detention centre in Bullingdon, Oxfordshire  wasted £1.7million before being abandoned. The agency also lost more than £8million after being told projects it ran for refugees failed to meet funding criteria laid down by the European Union. Some £1.6million was spent renting a building that was not needed while £1.5million was wrongly paid out to staff in payroll errors. The extraordinary errors were made at a time when UKBA bosses were receiving six-fugure salaries and generous bonuses. Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: ‘The UKBA appears to have been as dysfunctional at managing out money as it policing the borders. ‘It's simply not good enough that taxpayers' money has been wasted in this manner. The officials responsible should be held to account, not eased into another cushy roll where they can waste money yet again.’ UKBA was set up under Labour in 2008. It was first split almost two years ago, when passport checks and customs were hived off into a new Border Force after officials were found to have downgraded border checks used to spot terrorists. In March Mrs May announced it would be cut into two parts, one to deal with visa applications and backlogs and the other to track illegal migrants. In a damning assessment of its failings, she told MPs: ‘The agency has been a troubled organisation since it was formed in 2008 and its performance is not good enough.’ Responding to the revelations of waste, a Home Office spokesperson said: ‘The government is determined to build an immigration system that the public can have confidence in. 'We have already reformed the immigration rules and net migration is down by a third since its peak in 2010. ‘The UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation since it was formed in 2008 and its performance was not good enough. This is why we split the Agency and brought its work into the Home Office under two distinct directorates.’ The UKBA was created in 2008 to replace the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in the Home Office, a department which was already in chaos, with asylum claims piling up, and staff badly demoralised. It emerged some 450,000 asylum cases had not been dealt with but left in boxes at the Home Office. The shake-up that led to the creation of UKBA was meant to clear up the mess and stop similar scandals happening in future. But history repeated itself: Nearly 400 of the 1,000 foreign prisoners were told they could stay in Britain and dozens remained untraced. More than 100,000 of the 400,000 asylum seekers were allowed to stay, which MPs said in effect amounted to an ‘amnesty’. Around 500,000 Eurostar passengers boarded trains in France and arrived in the UK without being checked against the warnings index of suspected terrorists. Border security checks were also suspended regularly and applied inconsistently from 2007 onwards. In February last year, Theresa May hived off the UK Border Force, which is responsible for frontline controls at air, sea and rail ports, from the wider UKBA. But in November last year, John Vine, the independent chief inspector of the UKBA revealed that thousands of immigrants were allowed to stay in the UK without undergoing proper checks because of a mountainous backlog of cases. At one point 100,000 pieces of post were unopened and some 14,000 applicants had already been refused the right to stay but were still pleading with the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to reconsider. An additional 2,100 cases - shipped in a box from an office in Croydon to Sheffield - were still waiting for an initial decision at the time of the inspection with some dating back a decade. In a scathing report in March, the Home Affairs Select Committee said it would take the UKBA 24 years to clear through a backlog the size of the population of Iceland of asylum and immigration cases."

And there's plenty of room for growth, as only about 1 in every 4 Chinese has Internet access.

The 10th century BC 'Ophel Inscription' was unearthed last year, and scientists were initially baffled by the bizarre language that was inscribed on the remains of a jug. But leading expert Dr Douglas Petrovich believe the language is a primitive form of Hebrew which suggests the ancient Israelites were accurately recording history much earlier than previously thought. Scroll down for video The 3000-year-old Ophel Inscription was unearthed last year and scientists were initially baffled by the bizarre language that was inscribed on the remains of what was once a jug When the inscription was originally discovered in December 2012, experts immediately presumed it was an example of Canaanite language. The Canaanites were a Biblical people who lived in what is now modern Israel. But ancient Near Eastern history and biblical studies expert Dr Petrovich has said that this is incorrect and that the mysterious language is in fact the original and oldest form of Hebrew – placing the ancient Israelites in Jerusalem far earlier that previously thought. The inscription was found in Ophel, near near Temple Mount in Jerusalem (pictured) in December last year The inscription was found among a pile of pottery (pictured). Leading expert Douglas Petrovich believes the language is a primitive form of Hebrew which suggests the ancient Israelites were recording history much earlier than previously thought ‘Hebrew speakers were controlling Jerusalem in the 10th century [BC], which biblical chronology points to as the time of David and Solomon,' he told FoxNews.com. ‘Whoever they were, they were writing in Hebrew like they owned the place,’ he added. If the Dr Petrovich’s claim is correct, it could provide evidence of the accuracy of the Old Testament, and that the ancient Israelites were writing their history as things happened as opposed to writing it down hundreds of years later. If expert Douglas Petrovich is correct, it could mean the Bible stories of King David and King Solomon were not just passed down orally and recorded hundreds of years later but written down at the time and are true This would make the Old Testament an historical account of real-life events. As expected, Dr Petrovich’s claims are stirring up controversy among the archaeological community. Tel Aviv University archaeologist Israel Finkelstein told FoxNews.com that the Ophel Inscription is critical to the early history of Israel but that romantic notions of the Bible shouldn't cloud scientific methods. In 2008, when a similar inscription was found at a site many now believe is one of King David's palaces, he warned against the 'revival in the belief that what's written in the Bible is accurate like a newspaper.'"

The number of groups demanding money to release hostage is on the rise, with ransoms increasing by 25 per cent in just three years. There are fears that more and more countries are now willing to stump up money to free citizens being held by terrorists, increasing the likelihood of more kidnappings. Warning: The Foreign Office says the number of ransoms paid to kidnappers is on the rise, with more money demanded to release captives The G8 summit in Lough Erne, Northern Ireland in June agreed to ‘stamp out’ ransom payments to terror groups. David Cameron called on private firms to follow the lead of the most powerful countries in the world. Downing Street said it wanted to ‘suffocate terrorist sources of financing’. However, the families of people who are kidnapped say they had little choice but to pay money to have their loved ones returned. Somali gunmen kidnapped Brits Paul and Rachel Chandler off the Seychelles four years ago. Mrs Chandler's brother Stephen Collett negotiated a significant ransom for their release as the only option to secure the couple's release. Mr Collett said: 'I'm very unhappy at paying ransoms. But if we have a policy where there is no alternative, and the Foreign Office don't give you an alternative, they just seem to think if you just sit back and do nothing, eventually they might be released.' In the last three years £45million is thought to have been paid to free western hostages, equivalent to But Foreign Office officials say the amount charged per hostage is on the rise, from $4million in 2010 to $5million this year, the BBC reported. British sailors Paul and Rachel Chandler were only released by Somali pirates after their family paid a substantial ransom Earlier this year $22million was paid to Al Qaeda to release Swiss, Austrian and Finnish hostages and weeks later there was a security alert which closed US and UK embassies in Yemen. Aimen Deen, a terrorism expert from security consultants Five Dimensions, said: ‘Basically the money is taken and divided into several categories for several departments. ‘There is the weapons department. There are the training camps that need food and electricity. ‘They need money for weapons for training, they need to obtain chemicals for explosives, they need to pay for the tickets for people to travel... the renting of apartments abroad and the building of camps outside and inside of Yemen.’ The UK has had a policy of not paying ransoms since the 1970s, insisting it only encourages more hostage-taking. The Foreign Office said: ‘We want others in the international community to follow the G8’s lead so that terrorist groups no longer have any access to finances traditionally secured through ransom payments. ‘We believe this will severely hinder their ability to operate since ransoms represent the single most significant source of terrorist income.’"

The large illustration depicts two of the men lifting their sunglasses to peer at the backside of a lone woman as she walks by. Bosses at Caffe Nero – Britain’s third largest coffee-house chain with 500 cafes – say the image was supposed to ‘portray Italian culture’. But they now concede it may cause offence, and say it will be removed from all stores as soon as possible. Caffe Nero plans to remove dozens of these 'sexist' posters, which show three men ogling a woman in the street A Caffe Nero branch. Chiefs say they have removed the offending poster after complaints it was sexist Teacher Laura Palmer, 32, was visiting Caffe Nero in Ashford, Kent, with a group of new mothers when she spotted the print. She said: ‘I think it’s a really inappropriate image, which in my view promotes sexual discrimination and the sexualisation of women. It has undertones which are almost creepy – three guys standing by the side of the road in a pack with their eyes obviously drawn to the woman’s behind. I decided to complain. Foaming with anger: It had been claimed the poster portrayed everyday Italian life - instead it was accused of 'everyday sexism' ‘I was extremely shocked to be faced with such blatant leering at women. It just isn’t the sort of image Nero should be promoting.’ Writer Laura Bates, founder of the online Everyday Sexism Project which records women’s real-life brushes with sexism, said it was only right that the chain was taking the matter seriously. She said: ‘Some people will dismiss this as being a very minor issue, but behaviour like this is something that impacts on the lives of thousands of women and girls up and down the country. Being harassed in the street isn’t a harmless compliment – it can be scary, uncomfortable and have a real impact on women’s lives.’ However, Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke said he could not really understand what all the fuss was about. He said: ‘I have never had anyone come to me with an issue like this – and I have to admit that I don’t think the general public care that much.’ In an email response to Ms Palmer’s complaint, a customer service worker for Caffe Nero said: ‘This is one of 1,000 images we use in our stores, designed to portray Italian culture. But I can see how this might cause offence, which was never intended.’ Caffe Nero spokeswoman Ceri Aiken said: ‘We have stopped actively using this image, meaning it is no longer used in new stores, or existing stores given a refresh. We are also in the process of removing the image from stores where it is displayed.’"

The office of U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman has sought documents from Christie's reelection campaign and the New Jersey State Committee, which is controlled by the governor, relating to the alleged scheme that has rocked Christie's administration, Mark Sheridan of Patton Boggs said in a statement. The firm is representing both groups in investigations by the Justice Department and a special state committee, which has also sought materials from them, he said.

Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for Fishman, said that ""we can neither confirm nor deny any specific investigative actions."" Sheridan said the subpoenas involve investigations of whether top Christie appointees orchestrated traffic gridlock around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee over several days last September in an apparent bid to punish that town's mayor, Mark Sokolich, for not endorsing their boss for reelection. Christie denies any knowledge of the alleged scheme, but he fired one aide at the center of it and three others whose names have surfaced in e-mails around the scandal have also left their jobs. The scandal has heated up with Christie taking the oath of office for a second term this week. It has also raised questions about his brash governing style that has propelled him to the top of polls of potential Republican presidential candidates in 2016. The U.S. Attorney's office and state legislative investigators are also looking at allegations top New Jersey government officials pressured another local mayor, Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken, to back a redevelopment project favored by Christie as a condition of receiving Superstorm Sandy relief funds for her city. The officials, including Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, denied the accusation. Representatives from Fishman's office and the FBI interviewed two of Zimmer's staffers this week, according to a source close to the investigation.

In the wild, it instinctively protects animals from predators - but for humans, the emotion can be far more complex. Fear can trigger the 'fight or flight' response to raise the heart rate, sharpen the senses and provide access to huge amounts of energy in order to cope with threats to survival. At times, the threat is so intense it can cause a 'freeze' response. This could be interpreted as the brain being overwhelmed, or it may have evolved as a way of keeping still to hide from predators. Now neuroscientists have discovered exactly how the brain links its survival circuits to the spinal cord, causing the body to freeze in the face of danger. The discovery could help develop effective treatments for emotional disorders such as anxiety, panic attacks and phobias. Scientists know that memories are learned and stored in a small structure in the brain known as the amygdala. Any disturbing event activates neurons in the lateral and then central portions of the amygdala. The signals are then communicated internally, passing from one group of neurons to the next. From there, they reach neurons in the brainstem, the action centre for fear responses. Researchers believe something known as the periaqueductal gray (PAG) can trigger responses such as freezing, a high heart rate, increase in blood pressure and the desire for flight or fight. The discovery could help develop effective treatments for emotional disorders such as anxiety, panic attacks and phobias. Nicole Kidman (pictured) is known to suffer from panic attacks The study by Bristol University has discovered a brain pathway leading from the PAG to a part of the cerebellum – a region of the brain that controls motion - named the pyramis. The research went on to show that the pyramis is involved in generating freezing behaviour when someone faces danger. ‘There is a growing consensus that understanding the neural circuits underlying fear behaviour is a fundamental step towards developing effective treatments for behavioural changes associated with emotional disorders,’ said Dr Stella Koutsikou at the University of Bristol. Professor Bridget Lumb, Professor of Systems Neuroscience, added: ‘Our work introduces the novel concept that the cerebellum is a promising target for therapeutic strategies to manage dysregulation of emotional states such as panic disorders and phobias.’ Panic attack: Psychologists have said that humans have an innate response to danger that alerts our bodies before our cognitive brain has processed the threat"

Loose record-keeping caused the Pentagon and the U.S. command in Iraq to lose track of about 110,000 AK-47 rifles and 80,000 pistols provided to the new Iraqi national police and army, the Government Accountability Office told Congress. The investigative arm of Congress, the GAO also found that 250,000 pieces of body armor and helmets can't be accounted for. The report also says a review of the 2007 property books shows continuing problems with missing and incomplete records. The report, issued July 31, follows an October accounting by the Defense Department's special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, which put the number of weapons missing at close to 500,000. Auditors were unable to determine whether the weapons -- which included heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers -- were stolen, being used by insurgents or still in the hands of Iraqi units. A Pentagon official in Baghdad, who asked not to be identified, said some of the weapons went back to Iraqi forces and some were destroyed. But he conceded some of them may be missing. Asked whether they ended up in the hands of insurgents, he said there was no hard data, but ""anything is possible."" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Monday he is not aware of any reports that show U.S. weapons designated for Iraqi security forces have been found in the hands of insurgents. The missing weapons mostly dated back to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's rule, and none had serial numbers, the official said. Coalition commanders have tightened procedures for tracking the weapons, including using biometric data from Iraqi soldiers and police -- and since June, Iraqi units have been issued U.S.-made M-16 and M-4 rifles, which are electronically tracked, the official said. Officials with the U.S. training command blamed insufficient staff and the lack of a ""fully operational distribution network"" for the poor record-keeping, the GAO report states. Coalition trainers did not keep centralized records of the equipment they issued to Iraqi police and troops before December 2005, and the coalition ""has not consistently collected supporting documents that confirm when the equipment was received, the quantities of equipment delivered, or the Iraqi units receiving the equipment."" The report said the U.S. commander in charge of training Iraqi forces reported about 185,000 AK-47 rifles, 170,000 pistols, 215,000 items of body armor, and 140,000 helmets were issued to Iraqi security forces as of September 2005, while the accounting books from the U.S. military contained records for only about 75,000 AK-47 rifles, 90,000 pistols, 80,000 items of body armor, and 25,000 helmets. The GAO recommended the Pentagon set accountability standards for the training program and make sure it has adequate staff and technology to oversee the program. The GAO also recommended the Secretary of Defense determine what DOD accountability procedures should apply to the program and ensure sufficient staff, functioning distribution networks, and proper technology are available to meet the requirements. The Defense Department concurred with the recommendations and has begun a review ""to ensure proper accountability is in place for the Iraq train-and-equip program,"" the report states. Pentagon officials said Monday the accounting systems should be ""continuously improved upon and refined."" According to the report the United States has provided $19.2 billion to develop the Iraqi security forces and the United States has asked for another $2 billion to continue training and equipping Iraqi troops.

Claire Walker, 37, was stunned to discover the garage at the detached three-bedroom property in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was too narrow to accommodate her Volvo S40. Her partner Andy Birkhead, 33, managed to squeeze his Fiesta ST all the way in, but was left stuck in his car because there wasn't enough space to open his door. 'Abysmal': Claire Walker and her partner Andy Birkhead (seen left with son Billy), were stunned to discover the garage at their brand new £200,000 home is too small for their car to fit inside (right) Tight squeeze: Ms Walker claims the garage is not fit for purpose, and said it effectively knocks £8,000 off the value of the family's newly built home in Huddersfield The couple, who have a two-year-old son, Billy, only discovered the problem when they cleared out belongings they had been storing in the garage since moving into their new £209,950 home in March. When they complained to developer Persimmon, they were told they should have measured the garage before buying their new house, said Ms Walker. The furious health and safety manager has been told that the bungle could knock up to £8,000 off the value of their home. She said: 'It's not fit for purpose. The garage doesn't do what a garage should do. I'm absolutely fuming about it.' She explained: 'We didn't realise for a few months because the garage was stored with our belongings that we hadn't sorted after the move. I tried to get my car in recently but the wing mirrors make it too wide. 'It's a company car so I didn't want to scratch it, so Andy tried to get his car in. 'He could get it inside, but he couldn't open the doors. So unless you have a sunroof it doesn't look like there's any way you can get a car into the garage and step out of it.' Furious: Ms Walker, 37, said the garage - which measures 2m and 44cm from wall to wall - is too small to fit an average-sized family car No room: The couple, who have a two-year-old son, spent £209,950 on the detached family home in Huddersfield Ms Walker said the neighbours she has spoken to hadn't realised the problem, because none of them had been using their garages to store their cars. She explained that the specification for the house in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, gave dimensions for all rooms in the house - except the garage. She said: 'I've asked a number of estate agents about the problem, and at least two have told me that I can't advertise my house as having a garage if I know it doesn't function as a garage. 'They said they add 8,000 pounds on to the value of a house if it has a garage - so we've lost that off the 209,950 pounds we paid for the house. 'A house is meant to be an investment - and this one feels like a poor investment. 'I wrote to the chief operating officer of Persimmon but he replied saying he had referred the matter to the technical director in the regional team. 'Poor investment': Ms Walker said the garage houses a tumble dryer and lawnmower instead of the family car 'And that technical director suggested that I should have measured the garage before we put down a deposit. It's abysmal. 'When you buy a three-bedroom detached family home with a garage you expect the garage to be big enough to get a car into.' Ms Walker has since got out her measuring tape and researched the size of popular family cars on the internet. She found that the garage door width of 2m 3cm was too small for eight of the 14 cars she compared. 'Persimmon deemed the size to be appropriate but it's clearly not,' she said. Including wing mirror width the cars that wouldn't fit included some of the most popular models, from a Ford Focus to a Honda Civic. The garage is big enough to accommodate the Fiesta, the Vauxhall Astra, the Audi A3, the BMW 1 Series, the Mercedes C Class and the VW Jetta. But while the cars would go in, the 2m 44cm wall-to-wall width means none would have sufficient space to open the driver door. For now the 'garage' is used to store a dryer, two filing cabinets, a lawnmower and a strimmer. The mother-of-one said: 'Because the garage is built into the house we realise that they can't just knock it down and start again. 'We asked Persimmon if they would plaster the third wall - two are already done - and put some lino on the floor, so we could use it as a storage room with at least more insulation than it has now to keep out the damp, but they refused.' The couple's drive only has room for one car so they've asked for it to be widened to fit two cars, but they have heard nothing back since. 'We're not asking for anything drastic. It's not like we're asking them to knock down the house and start again,' Ms Walker said. Wayne Gradwell, managing director at Persimmon Homes, said: 'As one of the UK's leading housebuilders it can only be a matter of deep regret to us if any customer is dissatisfied with their new home. 'The garage in question is comparable with new build properties across the UK. We continue to work with Miss Walker and Mr Birkhead to try and resolve the situation.' A spokesperson for Persimmon added: 'The dimensions of each garage are governed by both the size of the house and the relevant planning regulations and are clearly laid out in the marketing brochure. We deeply regret that Miss Walker and Mr Birkhead are unhappy with the size of their garage.'"

The retail guru, who was hired by David Cameron to find ways to rescue dying town centres like Margate, described the decision as ‘a very sad day’. She has become an outspoken champion of small retailers and fought to try and revive town centres ravaged by the impact of large supermarkets. Battle: Retail guru Mary Portas has been hired to revive Britain's ailing high streets However, she has effectively been overruled by the equally combative Eric Pickles, the Secretary for communities and local government, who has approved the Margate scheme. The new Tesco, which had been fought by local residents and traders, will be a massive 82,000 square feet and sit on what is a key site on the seafront. The news will confirm suspicions that the original decision to hire Portas was more of a publicity stunt than a genuine attempt to help struggling high streets. For her key recommendations, which included cutting business rates and putting a brake on new shopping centres, have both been rejected. Threat: Mary Portas argues that places like Margate need to be protected from the impact of large supermarkets so that small businesses have a fighting chance Rather a penny-pinching and lack lustre funding scheme, called the Portas Pilots, has been set up to give small grants to a few town centre committees to support things like local markets. Last night, she condemned Mr Pickles’ decision to back the scheme, saying: ‘This is a sad day for Margate. ‘The time, energy and genuine care the people of Margate have put into rebuilding their high street is being completely undermined by the Secretary of State, Eric Pickles MP who has signed off an 82,000 square feet edge-of-town Tesco development. ‘If Government really believes in town centre first, how can they do this?’ She was selected by the Prime Minister to front a review of high streets on the strength of her record as a Channel 4 TV presenter, where she was shown helping small independent traders turn around failing businesses. Overruled: Secretary of State for Communities Eric Pickles MP has signed off an 82,000 square feet Tesco development in Margate despite Miss Portas' protestations However, it is clear that she has been left disappointed by the outcome of an initiative that has been dismissed by retail industry experts as mere window dressing. ‘I did this in between running a business, in between filming and having a family. You try your best…I just wish I had been better advised,’ she said. In April, Miss Portas accused the former Tesco boss, Sir Terry Leahy, of talking ‘crap’ when he described the rise of supermarkets as progress. She said: ‘That's absolutely crap. What happens is that 50p of every pound is spent on food. If you take that off the high street and put it into a 40,000ft out-of-town store and you provide free parking and everything under one roof, then you start to take away not only the food shops, but also the chemist, the fashion shops, the butcher… you start to displace the whole high street.’ One episode of her Channel 4 TV series ‘Mary Queen of the High Street’ involved focusing on Margate and breathing new life in to its shopping streets. Last year, she told residents she was keen to help their fight against Tesco, saying she was ‘passionate’ about the effects of big stores diverting business away from high streets. Expertise: David Cameron hired Miss Portas to be his retail expert back in 2011, charged with tackling the decline of towns all around Britain Miss Portas wrote to Mr Pickles last year urging him to reject the Tesco plan which she described it as a ‘disturbing threat’ to Margate. Retail expert, Bill Grimsey, the former chief executive of Wickes, described the news on Twitter as a ‘Slap in the face for Portas’. Local trader Robin Vaughn-Lyons, former chairman of the Margate Town Team, said he feared a lot of smaller businesses could end up closing as a result of the new Tesco. ‘I don't think it's good for our seafront at all... I'm sure it's going to take business away from coffee shops, local cafes, and things like that,’ he said. Designer Wayne Hemingway is at the forefront of a campaign to redevelop Margate’s seafront around a heritage-themed amusement park. The new Tesco store would sit alongside this and could, in theory, wreck the design. Regeneration: Designer Wayne Hemingway is also supposed to be saving Margate's town centre with a heritage-themed amusement park Mr Hemingway said he hoped Tesco could be persuaded to give its store a vintage feel. ‘We will kick them in the b******* until they say they will,’ he said. A letter to the developers from Mr Pickles’ department said the supermarket plan was ‘acceptable’ and ‘would perform the economic, social and environmental roles of sustainable development towards which it aims’. While the Government has given its approval, the application is still at the centre of a judicial review supported by residents which could overturn the decision. Tesco said: ‘Tesco is a tenant in this developer-led project. The developer’s application is now subject to a judicial review. We look forward to the outcome.’"

Researchers from Essex University and the University of Oxford have found that minorities living in mixed areas were five per cent likely to identify with being British than those who didn't. People who lived separately from their own ethnicity were also just as likely to take part in community activities, help out their neighbours and trust those they lived with as those who segregated themselves. A study has found that minorities who live separated from their own ethnicity are more likely 'to feel' British, and than more integration in Britain should be encouraged The study of 4,391 people, 3,582 of which came from ethnic minorities found that, for white Britons, being poor was a bigger factor in breaking down trust between neighbours than race. 'Diversity is really good for minority members in Britain,' the report's co-author, Neli Demireva, said. 'If they live in diverse scenarios they identify more with Britain. Contact is good because they don't create reactive identities.' The report echoes comments by Lord Tebbit, who said that he was concerned by foreign minorities seeking to 'create their own country in Britain' The paper, published in Sociology, reverses years of study on the topic, with previous studies suggesting that ethnic mixing made people less trusting and lowered levels of community spirit. In conclusion, the report said: 'If anything, diversity should be encouraged to cement the integration progress of migrants.' The conclusion echoes statements by former Tory Party Chairman Lord Tebbit, who has criticised those who 'recreate their own country in Britain'. Speaking to Sky News in 2013, he said: 'The problem that is caused in our cities is caused by immigrants from the third world who have got no intention of integrating here. 'They are people who left their country, came here and are trying to recreate their country in our country. 'We are building not so much a multi-racial society or a multi-cultural society, we are building separate societies which really don't have much to do with each other.' David Cameron has also previously said that young immigrants should be taught to speak English and warned that some minorities are now more segregated from the rest of the country than their parents."

Lord West of Spithead, a former first sea lord, complained that too many artworks in the Palace of Westminster appeared to be of French battlefield defeats. He called for the balance to be redressed, including a mural of the First World War to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the conflict this year. There are thousands of paintings, sculpture and murals dotted around the Houses of Parliament which form part of a priceless collection. The Royal Gallery near the House of Lords is dominated by two large 19th century paintings by the Irish artist Daniel Maclise. One fresco, 'The Death of Nelson', depicts the moment Lord Nelson, was shot aboard HMS Victory during France's defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Hanging opposite is 'The Meeting of Wellington and Blucher', which shoes the Duke of Wellington and the Prussian Field Marshall Blycher at the La Belle Alliance inn before defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Speaking in the Lord today, Lord West said there was too much emphasis on Britain's triumphs over its great rival across the Channel. The Labour peer said: 'I have noticed around the Palace of Westminster that nearly all the paintings of battle seem to be us defeating the French, which seems a little mean. 'We fought most nations in the world and I wonder in this centenary of the First World War could we maybe commission a mural representing something like Jutland or the famous battle of Amiens in 1918, in time for that commemoration?' Lord Sewel, chairman of committees, replied: 'Well, I'm certainly going to duck that one. 'Commissioning of works of art is a matter for the Works of Art Committee and fortunately that is one of the few domestic select committees in this House that I don't chair, and I'm very grateful.' After leaving the Royal Navy, Lord West was a security minister in Gordon Brown's government. He raised the issue of the artworks after Conservative peer Baroness Trumpington joked that she would be dead before the Maclise murals were restored. Lord Sewel said the condition of the Waterloo and Trafalgar murals had been investigated during two research projects with the Cologne University of Applied Sciences. He said results of the research showed there was an opportunity of achieving a 'very high level of restoration'. This painting of Wellington and Blucher on the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 by Daniel Maclise hangs in the Royal Gallery in Parliament Lord Sewel told Lady Trumpington: 'The initial research is now complete and discussions will take place with the university's staff over the summer about the next steps towards restoration. 'The Works of Art Committee will consider a range of possible options in the autumn.' Lady Trumpington replied: 'It's now several years since I asked my original question on this subject, I should be dead before the damn thing is done.' She added: 'Would I be right in assuming that the Royal Gallery is much admired and loved by everybody except possibly the French president (and) also for the fact it does show women on the battlefield and on fighting ships? 'And I would be grateful if some speed can be shown in the reconstruction, if necessary, over painting I would have thought, so that we are even more proud of the Royal Gallery when the work is finished.' Critics warned too many paintings in Parliament were in need of restoration work after several years Lord Sewel replied: 'I certainly hope it won't be a matter of you looking down kindly on us when the time comes for them to be revealed in their original true glory or as close to their original true glory as we can get it. 'I think the important thing is considering the national and international importance of these murals to get it right rather than to get it soon. 'It's a very challenging task to restore the paintings to as near to their original condition as possible. 'One of the, I think, very heartening results of the research that was carried out was the original pigment beneath the various layers has survived much more successfully in the Royal Gallery than was the case in the robing room. 'So we really do have the opportunity of achieving a very high level of restoration and I think we should make sure we do get it right.'

Insisting ‘enough is enough’, energy minister John Hayes said turbines had been ‘peppered around the country’ with little or no regard for local opinion. He said existing sites and those in the pipeline would be enough to meet green commitments with no need for more. ‘Even if a minority of what’s in the system is built we are going to reach our 2020 target,’ he said. ‘I’m saying enough is enough.’ But at an early-morning showdown with his boss - Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey - Mr Hayes was told he does not decide government policy. Mr Hayes told the Mail he had commissioned research on the impact of wind turbines on the landscape and whether they drive down house prices. He has also asked scientists to examine noise complaints and more sinister suggestions that the turbines endanger military aircraft by blocking radar signals. The intervention by Mr Hayes, who became energy minister in last month’s reshuffle, will delight 100-plus fellow Tory MPs who have urged David Cameron to take a more sceptical approach to onshore wind power. It does however risk a clash with the Liberal Democrats, who are enthusiastic advocates of renewable energy. A source close to Mr Davey said today: 'John does not decide government policy. There will be no change. We are in a coalition government, not a single party government and definitely not a single minister government. 'We are determined to make sure the coalition lives up to the Prime Minister’s pledge to make it the greenest government ever.' At a meeting of ministers at the Energy department this morning, Mr Davey made clear his anger at Mr Hayes. 'Ed is of the opinion that he ultimately signs off renewables policy. He is the Secretary of State. John is not in the Cabinet and he is not Secretary of State,' the source added. In a statement later Mr Davey said: 'There has been no change to Government policy on renewable energy, as collectively agreed by the Coalition Cabinet. Energy Secretary Ed Davey today slapped down Mr Hayes, insisting onshore wind has 'an important role to play' in Britain 'Onshore wind is one of the cheapest renewables, which is why we’ve been able to cut the subsidy.  It has an important role to play in our energy future.' However Mr Hayes suggested the controversy over turbines was giving other sources of renewable power – such as offshore wind, solar and tidal power – a bad name. ‘The onshore wind debate is skewing the whole debate, which is not good for the Government, not good for people and not good for the renewables lobby,’ he told the Mail. ‘We can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities. I can’t single-handedly build a new Jerusalem but I can protect our green and pleasant land. ‘Firstly, I have asked the planning minister to look again at the relationship between these turbines and the landscape. ‘It seems extraordinary to have allowed them to be peppered around the country without due regard for the interests of the local community or their wishes. ‘We have issued a call for evidence on wind. That is about cost but also about community buy-in. We need to understand communities’ genuine desires.’ Mr Hayes said policy should not be based on some ‘bourgeois left article of faith’. ‘These things are about the people and I am the people’s minister,’ he added. Controversial: The Energy Minister said onshore wind farms are turning people against other sources of renewable energy such as offshore alternatives and solar power ‘I want to look at a broader analysis of the effects – I mean house price values, and other quality of life issues. I want to look particularly at noise, so I have asked the Institute of Acoustics to look at the noise issue from a completely independent perspective. ‘There is a case where people had to move from their family farm because of noise. It is very often the case that local authorities don’t have the wherewithal to address these planning issues.’ Mr Hayes said defence ministers had agreed to investigate claims of radar interference from the spinning blades. The Government has set a target of increasing the amount of power generated by onshore wind farms to 13 gigawatts by 2020. But in an indication of a shift in Government policy, ministers announced this summer that the subsidy for onshore wind power generation would be cut by 10 per cent this year. Approvals for onshore wind farms – around 3,800 turbines are in operation – have however reached record levels, according to figures published yesterday. RenewableUK, the wind industry trade body, said in a statement: ‘For the first time in five years, the UK is seeing a rise in the amount of UK capacity approved at a local level.’ There was a 15 per cent increase in approval rates for smaller onshore projects with capacity of less than 50 megawatts last year compared with the previous year, it said. Applications for new wind farms have to be made to councils, and around a half are refused. But under the existing system, energy companies often win on appeal to the planning inspectorate. Campaigners took heart from a court ruling in May, in which villagers in Hemsby, on the edge of the Norfolk Broads, succeeded in blocking four 350ft turbines after a judge agreed their right to preserve their landscape was more important than renewable energy targets. Tory MP Chris Heaton Harris, who has led calls for a rethink on wind power, said of Mr Hayes’s remarks: ‘This is a huge step forward. These awful turbines do nothing for the environment – they barely reduce CO2 – they force up energy bills and put more people into fuel poverty. ‘It’s about time the Government listened in this way. Communities will be delighted that they may now be spared the torment they have seen others go through when turbines go up.’ Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson, an arch-sceptic on climate change, said: ‘I would welcome the minister’s statements. I would hope they would translate into a moratorium. An additional problem is that wind power is one of the most expensive forms of generating electricity there is. ‘At a time when there is so much concern both from households and industry about the cost of energy, that too should be a decisive argument against going this way.’ But Labour seized on the coalition row about the future of wind farms. Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: 'Britain needs a clean, diverse and secure energy supply – but this Government appears clueless when it comes to delivering clean energy and fair bills. 'With energy bills skyrocketing, what hard pressed people urgently want is action but instead we have a shambles of a Tory-led Government which can't even agree with itself.' Greenpeace Energy Campaigner Leila Deen said: 'John Hayes’ petulant outburst adds to the Coalition’s growing energy shambles and to a deepening divide within Government between those who care about green growth and the economy and those who just want more oil and gas. 'Here is a new minister veering off brief and publicly contradicting his bosses. His comments threaten jobs and his approach will drive up energy bills.'"

A new study conducted at the University of Exeter found that there were numerous health benefits to spending time near the ocean. The study was presented last Wednesday at a science policy conference hosted by the American Geophysical Union. Good for you: A study presented on Wednesday by University of Exeter researchers found that living at the beach improves your health The multi-faceted study conducted several experiments to determine whether being near a beach setting affected health. When a person goes to the beach, 'It's not going to be any great surprise to you that people relax,' said study researcher Michael White. The more complex question was how being near the beach impacted people's health. The researchers studied census data in England and found that those who lived near the coast reported better health. Better at the beach: By looking at census data, researchers found that coastal dwellers were generally healthier than inland natives - especially the lower socioeconomic groups While one could argue that this may have something to do with wealthier people being able to afford living on the coast, the researchers actually found that it was the lower socioeconomic communities that reported the greatest health benefits. Just moving closer to the beach had an effect on people. The researchers found that moving closer to the sea 'significantly improves people's well being,' about as tenth as much as getting a new job. Moving to the sea may also reduce stress and encourage physical activity, White said. In one experiment the researchers gave study participants a set of pictures with hypothetical hotel room views, then asked how much they were willing to pay for the room. Get well: The researchers believe their results may help start a therapy program based on ocean exposure Subjects had an option of an ocean view, green fields or cities. The results showed that the majority of the subjects would pay the most for the ocean view. The researchers are continuing to study the health benefits of seaside living. One of their ongoing studies involves putting people in stressful situations like dental surgeries and then placing them virtually in a beach setting or dental room for comparison. Early signs show that people reported feeling less pain when immersed in the seaside setting. One of the study's organizers, Lora Fleming, said their results could help create a form of therapy based on ocean exposure."

After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, it took him months to walk home to his family. Eventually, he fled to safety in the United States. ""Food was ... more important than God,"" Chhang said. ""I always wish to have a bowl of rice. And one good night's sleep. That's all I wanted. I would do anything for it.""  Watch Youk Chhang talk about what he ate, how he survived » But the ghosts of the genocide brought Chhang back to Cambodia. And for more than a decade, he has run the Documentation Center of Cambodia. ""DC-Cam,"" as it is known, is the world's largest repository of information about the Cambodian genocide. It holds hundreds of thousands of documents, photos and films as well as interviews with both survivors and former Khmer Rouge members. Chhang said he believes the Khmer Rouge kept such careful records as a measure of their success -- a trophy of sorts. ""At each time when they kill a person, they document it so that they can measure their success one step forward,"" Chhang said. ""If they kill two, then two step forward. If they kill five, then five step forward. So to them, it's a golden file. But I mean, to us it's crime against humanity."" DC-Cam has located and mapped nearly 200 prisons and 20,000 mass graves across the country. For Chhang and DC-Cam, the work is critical to preserving memory and promoting justice.  Watch as Chhang takes CNN's Christiane Amanpour into DC-Cam's secured vault » Today in Cambodia, a tribunal is under way to try five of the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge -- 30 years after their alleged crimes. DC-Cam is providing much of the evidence for use in the trial, evidence that makes plain the facts of the genocide, the scope of the losses and the personal and national grief. Chhang said he hopes the tribunal will help Cambodians move forward -- and help heal the nation he loves. But even now, the way forward is difficult. Chhang has dedicated a lifetime of work, research, preservation and advocacy to his mother, whose bravery and sacrifice inspired him. Even though his mother survived and they shared much of the same pain and many of the same losses, the two do not talk about what happened. Some in Cambodia are anxious to forget and forgive. Others are angry and searching for justice. Many, like Chhang, said that only by knowing, exploring and exposing the truth will Cambodia be able to rectify its past -- and secure a healthy future."

Police were called to a home on Wednesday after a woman claimed the dogs - who she believed were vicious wolves or coyotes - dragged her cat down a creek bank and cornered her husband. Officers said they tried to deter the mud-covered dogs with pepper spray, but had to shoot when they turned on police. Tragic: Police fatally shot three-year-old Siberian Huskies Atka and Kenai thinking they were vicious coyotes However Lindsay Schild, owner of three-year-old Atka and Kenai, claimed the shooting was unjustified. She said her dogs, which had escaped from a relative's yard in nearby Liberty Point, were not aggressive. 'I just want justice for my damn dogs,' Schild told Fox 32. Schild's sister Kara Michalec said the family pets had never attacked anyone. 'They [police] had said in the report they weren't being aggressive,' Michalec told Fox 32. 'Why did they take such vicious actions right away? 'And my question is if they were gonna put the animals down or they had to shoot them, why did each dog have to be shot several times?' Examiner.com reported that officers fatally shot each dog at least three to four times. Devastated: Owner Lindsay Schild (left) and her sister Kara Michalec claimed the Siberian Huskies were not aggressive But police chief Peter Land said officers had no choice but to shoot after using pepper spray and making loud noises to try to scare the dogs away. 'We know now that they were two dogs, however based on their aggressive nature and physical appearance he thought they were maybe larger sized coyotes,' he told Fox 32. 'The husband was trying to fight them off using a shovel. Self-defence: Police chief Peter Land tried pepper spray before shooting the dogs 'The dogs are now literally circling the officer, showing their teeth, acting in a very aggressive manner. 'Our officers certainly didn't want to shoot two dogs but the situation they were presented with they really had no choice.' According to dogbreedinfo.com, Siberian Huskies are 'loving, gentle, playful, happy-go-lucky dogs' that are 'docile, social, relaxed and rather casual'. However, the site also noted that a 'lonely Husky, or a Husky that does not get enough mental and physical exercise can be very destructive' and 'likes to roam'. Schild told nwitimes.com she doesn't want her dogs' deaths to be in vain. 'I'm going to do everything in my power to try to get something changed so people become more aware of huskies,' she said. 'I want to get something out there so this doesn't happen again.'"

Almost a third of the 4.1m people treated for asthma in the UK did not show any 'clear evidence' of the incurable condition, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) . This means they may be receiving unnecessary treatment. However, asthma charities warned diagnosing asthma is difficult and the majority of  patients 'do not receive adequate care'. And experts cautioned that no one diagnosed with the condition should stop taking prescribed medication unless instructed by a healthcare professional. More than a million people may have been wrongly diagnosed as having asthma - and may be receiving unnecessary treatment NICE has drafted new guidance, its first for asthma, for doctors in England to improve the accuracy of diagnoses. The guideline makes it clear that a clinical test should be carried out to diagnose asthma, as well as checking for signs and symptoms. It said the first test should be carried out using a spirometer, a machine which measures how much and how fast a person breathes out. Further breath tests should be carried out depending on the results from spirometry and the patient's age. For adults and young people over five years, an FeNO test should be carried out. This is a test which checks for levels of nitric oxide, a gas which is found in larger volumes in people with asthma. A BDR test4 which measures whether standard medicines which widen the airways of the lung are of benefit Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness. The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person. Asthma can be controlled well in most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems. Occasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an 'asthma attack', although doctors sometimes use the term 'exacerbation'. Severe attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual. Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. When a person come into contact with something that irritates the lungs – known as a trigger – the airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm). The reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that a person is more likely to develop it if they have a family history of the condition. Asthma can develop at any age, including in young children and elderly people. Source: NHS Choices The treatment of children under five should be based on professional judgement and observation until the child is old enough to take clinical tests. Around 1 in 10 of adults with asthma develops the condition because they are exposed to certain substances, such as chemicals or dust, in their workplace. The draft guideline also recommends that healthcare professionals ask employed people how their symptoms are affected by work, to check if they may have occupational asthma. During each review, the healthcare professionals should check the patient is able to use their inhaler correctly and also consider using a questionnaire to get a better estimate of how well a person is doing, it added. Professor Mark Baker, director of clinical practice at NICE, said: 'Asthma is a long-term incurable condition that affects millions of people of all ages. 'If left untreated, asthma attacks can be life threatening. 'However, with appropriate treatment and thoughtful monitoring, most people will be able to successfully control their symptoms and be spared from serious harm. 'Accurate diagnosis of asthma has been a significant problem which means that people may be wrongly diagnosed or cases might be missed in others. 'Our aim with this guideline is to give clarity and set out the most clinical and cost effective ways to diagnose and monitor asthma based on the best available evidence.' Asthma is one of the world's most common long-lasting diseases in childhood, affecting 1.1m children and 4.3m adults in the UK. Around 10 per cent of the 5.4 million people in the UK with asthma have the most severe form, which leaves them unable to control their symptoms, resulting in frequent attacks, despite taking multiple high-strength medicines. Experts today highlighted the need for respiratory diseases to be diagnosed accurately. Professor Anna Murphy, a consultant pharmacist and spokesperson for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said: ‘I think there are issues in primary care in diagnosing asthma. NICE says doctors should now carry out clinical test as well as observations in order to diagnose asthma. The  first test should be carried out using a spirometer, a machine which measures how much and how fast a person breathes out (pictured) 'We need to do a thorough history and do objective tests to confirm the findings we suspect. ‘Unfortunately we’re often not doing these tests and so people are being misdiagnosed. ‘Getting the diagnosis right before we get suggest treatment for any disease is important. ‘If we're given asthma treatment for breathlessness and it’s not working, it could be that the person has COPD, anaemia, or heart failure, which will need to be treated appropriately. ‘Other people with these conditions could slip through the net.' There aren't too many risks for people taking inhalers at the doses generally prescribed by doctors and pharmacists, she added, but as they are steroid inhalers they could induce side-effects of oral thrush and a hoarse voice. 'There’s also a cost to the NHS of wasted treatment,' she continued. However, she said asthma can be fatal and so stressed people diagnosed with the condition should not stop their treatment without the advice of a healthcare professional. 'We can’t miss the fact that people die from asthma, so I don’t want people to think “I don’t have asthma” and stop their treatment. 'It’s a variable disease which will be well-controlled at some points, but they will have symptoms such as breathlessness, coughing at night, and wheezing at other times. Experts said people misdiagnosed with asthma could actually be suffering breathlessness for a different reason, such as COPD, lung diseases anaemia or heart failure, which should be treated appropriately 'What we would recommend for anyone with well-controlled disease, is that it’s good practice for the healthcare professional to slowly start reducing their treatments, in a controlled way, so the need less. 'They would be monitored to make sure people are safe.' Dr Nick Hopkinson, a respiratory physician and medical advisor for the British Lung Foundation echoed these concerns. He told Mailonline: ‘Tens of hundreds of thousands of people are taking inhalers they don’t need is wasteful. ‘Some people with asthma could end up with high doses of inhaled steroids, when the correct dose for them is zero.’ Commenting on the draft guideline, Kay Boycott, chief executive at Asthma UK, said: 'We welcome the NICE guideline for the improvement of asthma diagnosis in the hope that this will help people with asthma receive more personalised care. 'Asthma has many complex causes which is one of the reasons why it is sometimes difficult to get a definitive diagnosis. 'It is also a highly variable condition that can change throughout someone’s life or even week by week, meaning treatment can change over time. 'For anyone with an asthma diagnosis, it is vital they have the right medication and a plan to better manage their condition and any asthma attacks.'"

It is understood the 61-year-old was with family and friends in the house when two masked gunmen tried to force their way inside. Accused: Drug baron John Gilligan was released from prison last year for a cannabis trafficking scheme. He had denied and was acquitted of the murder of the journalist Victoria Guerin Gilligan is believed to have locked himself in a downstairs toilet as the attackers got inside. Up to four shots were fired in the attempted murder, Irish police said.

Gilligan was tried for her murder and was acquitted Gardai said that two men forced their way into the gangster's brother's house on Greenfort Crescent where the day-long christening celebrations had been taking place. Both men were armed and wearing masks. Gilligan was treated at the scene and then taken to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown with what police described as 'non-fatal' injuries.

A young girl who seems OK one minute can turn on a dime. But Musyoka, who works at the Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya, says he has no time to think about loss. ""More are still coming, so we have to do something about that,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""It's very challenging mentally, I'd say, because you lose life. But what do you do about the next one?"" ""How are you going to respond?"" he asks. Such are the questions aid agencies are struggling to answer as fighting and famine push hundreds of thousands of Somalis to Dadaab, located near the border. The United Nations has declared famine in five areas in southern Somalia, including the capital of Mogadishu. The human catastrophe was triggered by the worst drought in more than half a century and compounded by decades of conflict, high inflation and increasing global food and fuel prices. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance; Somalia is the worst hit. Originally built for less than 100,000 people, the Dadaab refugee complex now houses more than 400,000, while tens of thousands more cling to its edges. Many of the children who arrive at the camp are severely malnourished, according to relief workers. Some have spent weeks on the road with their mothers, walking at night to avoid the heat, braving dust and dirt storms. Extra beds have been added to the children's ward of a hospital, run by the International Rescue Committee. A six-month old, suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, weighs six pounds. He should be twice that. A listless, four-year-old girl is fed what looks to be fortified milk from a plastic mug; a hand props up her head. Still, they are the lucky ones, says CNN's Sanjay Gupta. About 29,000 children have died in the last month, according to U.N. estimates. And many who are sick will never recover. One such girl was Sarah. Her father, Aden Ibrahim, buried her body beneath the desert floor some two weeks ago. She was four. ""She needed more help,"" Ibrahim said then. ""We have not been given enough help because we have been given flour and maize only -- and a child who is sick will not get better on flour and maize."" The U.N.'s refugee agency is calling for more private and government donations for emergency operations in the Horn of Africa, warning that a lack of funds threatens future aid. The aid organization says it needs $145 million to cover operations through the end of the year, adding that it has received 45% of that amount so far. CNN correspondent David McKenzie recently revisited Ibrahim, who is now confined to his bed inside a makeshift tent. ""I haven't been able to do anything since I saw you last,"" said Ibrahim, weakened by fever and coughing fits. ""All I can do is lie in bed with my son."""

Strict rules forcing foreign family members of European Union residents to get a permit before visiting the UK were scrapped by the European Court of Justice. This leaves Britain facing a fresh surge of non-EU migrants if they are related to someone living in the EU, and encourages people who want to exploit Britain’s way of life entering the country. Scroll down for video Test case: Sean McCarthy, a dual British and Irish national who lives and works in Spain, challenged the law because his Colombian wife needs a permit to visit Britain despite  their children being British (all pictured) The ruling by the court, which interprets EU law, also makes it less likely the Prime Minister will be able to renegotiate rules on freedom of movement. Mr Cameron has pledged to end abuse by so-called ‘third country nationals’ – those from outside the EU who gain rights to live in the UK by marrying non-British EU citizens. Ministers are concerned that sham marriages to EU citizens accompanied by easy-to-obtain residence papers in some EU countries would become another back door into Britain. The ruling came in a case brought by Sean McCarthy, a dual British and Irish national who lives and works in Spain, and his wife, a Colombian. They claimed her rights to freedom of movement were being infringed because she has to obtain a ‘family permit’ visa every time she wants to travel to the UK even though she holds an EU Residence Card issued in Spain and both their children are British. Freedom of movement: The ruling is a blow to politicians' promises for tighter migration controls Thousands of jobs will be advertised in the UK only after ministers agreed a new deal with Brussels. Under current rules, any jobs posted on the Government-run website Universal Jobmatch must also be placed on a European website, which helps would-be migrants search for work. EU countries have now agreed to allow firms to advertise domestic vacancies only in their own country. The deal could encourage more companies to recruit locally because they would have to specifically opt-in if they wanted to advertise outside the UK. Employment Minister Esther McVey said: ‘The new rules will significantly reduce the number of jobs advertised in Europe and put British residents first. We will continue to work to ensure the system remains fair to jobseekers and to businesses.’ The proposal still needs to be passed by the European Commission. Ruling in the McCarthys’ favour, the European Court said Britain was ‘not permitted’ to bar the spouse and children of an EU citizen from entering the UK without a visa. The Government had introduced the rules because it was concerned that residence permits handed out by other EU nations did not meet international security standards. The judges said Britain was able to assess documents at the border. The ruling only applies to the families of EU residents who are living in the EU outside their home nation. If, for instance, Mrs McCarthy was married to a Spanish man living in Spain, she would still need to apply for a visa. Tory MEP Timothy Kirkhope, the party’s spokesman in Brussels on justice and home affairs, criticised the judgment. ‘Britain will always be best placed to deal with its own immigration needs not a judge in Luxembourg,’ he said. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: ‘This is yet another ECJ judgment which weakens our ability to control entry to the UK. This ruling trumps a UK immigration control designed to prevent abuse.’ A Government spokesman said: ‘The UK is disappointed. It is right to tackle the abuse of free movement rights.’"

Helen Hart, 46, from Illogan, Cornwall, blew the cash on a champagne lifestyle including expensive cars, diamonds and £8,000 hotel stays. She told her boss she had inherited the fortune from a gangland uncle who was friends with the Kray Twins. More than 30 pairs of shoes will form part of an online auction of designer items seized from fraudster Helen Hart Gucci jewellery will start at just £1 in the auction which will take place on Monday Brands of shoes include those from designers Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Russell and Bromley But in reality she was milking the accounts at Cornish engineering firm PDP Green Consulting and left the company facing an unpaid £271,000 tax bill in May 2011. Police spent the next year unravelling the trail of missing money before charging Hart with multiple counts of fraud, theft and deception. Helen Hart was jailed for four years for stealing £320,000 from the company where she worked She was jailed for four years earlier this month at Truro Crown Court after previously admitting 25 separate charges spanning October 2005 to May 2012. Now Devon and Cornwall Police are selling off items confiscated from Hart after her arrest. They include 32 pairs of designer shoes from Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Russell and Bromley, as well as lavish jewellery from the likes of Gucci, Harrods and Tiffany & Co. Many of the 71 items, which all have a starting price of £1, will be sold for a fraction of their high street price before the auction on the Bumblebee Auctions website finishes on Monday. A spokesman from Devon and Cornwall Police’s financial investigation unit at Truro said: 'Confiscation of assets is part of the sentencing process. Helen Hart lived an affluent lifestyle which included buying expensive items for her personal use. 'She should not be allowed to benefit from the proceeds of her crimes and this process helps that be the case. We work hard to ensure that the proceeds of crime are taken from criminals.

The England international made his first appearance in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday following a five-month absence, and took just 12 minutes to score as Liverpool beat West Ham 2-0. Sturridge used the trademark celebration on his highly-anticipated return at Anfield but the 25-year-old has exclusively explained it only came about because of a change in the rules.

'Back in the day the best celebration was the shirt over the head, but now that's a yellow card – that's how this one started.

Amy Adams gets to work cleaning up as Rose in the indie comedy ""Sunshine Cleaning."" Sisters Rose (Amy Adams) and Norah (Emily Blunt) struggle with menial jobs and periods of unemployment. Together, they're also coping with the nasty emotional residue of their mom's long-ago suicide -- a trauma that is likely responsible for their current troubles. Self-esteem isn't a strong suit for either of them. As ""Sunshine Cleaning"" dawns, they're both scraping by. If Norah is out of work before we've settled into our popcorn, she's not overly concerned by her situation. Rose, on the other hand, is desperate to graduate from cleaning other people's middle-class homes. It's not just that the humiliation of laundering for her old cheerleader team is getting her down; she needs the money to put her ""difficult"" kid (Jason Spevack) into the kind of school that will give him a chance. It's Rose's married boyfriend -- and old high school sweetheart -- Mac (Steve Zahn) who spies a new niche for the sisters. A homicide detective, he's watching the cleaning crew bag the blown brains of a shotgun enthusiast when he overhears the proprietor of the building grousing about the ""three grand"" it's costing him. Granted, blood and intestinal juices aren't everybody's cup of tea, but that kind of return sure beats washing Mrs. Johansson's drapes for $30 an hour. ""CSM: Crime Scene Maid"" isn't a job you're likely to find down at the employment office, but somebody must be doing the dirty work. Rose and Norah -- incorporated -- find that the stench takes some getting used to, and there's a whole new arsenal of cleaning fluids to master, but they get to work with a positive attitude and like to think they're doing their bit to put the world right. From this unusual setup, the movie might have skewed in any number of ways. The sisters might have uncovered evidence of corruption and murder, for instance, perhaps implicating Mac? ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is nowhere near so abrasive or generic as such a scenario. Written by Megan Holley and directed by Christine Jeffs (""Sylvia""), it instead puts a sympathetic, gentle comic gloss on the characters' fundamentally forgivable foibles and imperfections. Norah tracks down the daughter of one suicide (Mary Lynn Rajskub) to present her with mementos that should have been destined for the junkyard. Blunt's edgy performance keeps us guessing. Norah's a bit of a flake, but she's animated by her anger and her rebellious streak. If she's hard to read, it's because she's still young and doesn't know herself yet. Rose is easier to understand. She's determined to seize this chance to dig herself out of the hole and recapture the promise she used to see in herself. Adams has a knack for putting a brave face on things -- something about the way she tilts her chin up while her mouth goes in three directions at once. She keeps our rooting interest in Rose alive even when her choices seem misguided or naive. A subplot concerning Rose's son bonding with Joe (Alan Arkin), the sisters' lovable but infuriating father (you know the kind: He buys bulk orders of shrimp off the back of a truck) tips us too far into the realm of indie quirk. The character is a useful sounding board, and an amusing grouch, but it's just about impossible to imagine this man bringing up these girls. Ironically, for a movie that's marketed with the one-liner ""Life's a messy business,"" Holley's script has been polished to within an inch of its life. Emotions are experienced most vividly when they're raw, but in ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" feelings come filtered through neat-and-tidy grace notes. The film flirts with dangerous material, but it's too intent on putting the sunny side up to get its hands dirty. The way director Jeffs tells it, not only is suicide painless it can be positively feel-good. That's not to say there isn't a lot to enjoy in this well-acted and humanistic comedy. Buoyed by its up-and-coming stars and its optimistic message, it should do very nicely with discriminating audiences. ... It might even clean up."

Witnesses have described watching the green-tinged ‘fireball’ shoot over England and Wales in a northerly direction at around 9.45pm on Wednesday. Some observers were convinced it was a UFO, and thousands took to twitter to find out what was happening. Scroll down for video Grabs, taken from CCTV footage in Cardiff, show what appears to be a large meteor flashing across the night sky. The meteor is the small dot seen at the top of the image, in the centre. The meteor looks like a blue and green light and was spotted with a tail behind it moving quickly in the sky on Wednesday. There were also reported sightings in Cornwall, Lancashire, Wales and Worcestershire The technical name for Halley’s Comet's is Comet 1P/Halley. A comet is an small body of ice that travels through our solar system. Halley's Comet orbits the Sun once every 75 years or so. It can travel close to Neptune and Venue on its orbit around the Sun. As it gets close to the Sun, the ice it is made of turns into gas, which creates a tail. The comet also drops debris including dust and gravel as it orbits. When this debris enters the Earth's atmosphere it begins to burn quickly and brightly and this is what  experts think Wednesday night's meteor was caused by. Experts believe the meteor might have formed from debris from Halley's Comet. Sightings were recorded in Cornwall, Hampshire, Lancashire, South Wales and Worcestershire. Louise Darnell also reported the unusual event on the social networking site. She wrote: ‘Seen the brightest and lowest shooting star ever! It was definitely a UFO..??’ Virtual Astronomer tweeted a picture of the ‘fireball’ taken over Wiltshire. The meteor was captured by cameras from the UK Meteor Network. The left picture was shot by a camera in Clanfield. The right picture shows the meteor over Ash Vale South Many of the UK Meteor Network’s cameras caught footage of the shooting star on their cameras in Clanfield, Ash Vale. Reports suggested the meteor crossed Britain from the South East towards the North West. Space scientist Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock said last night's shooting star, though unusually large, was likely to have been no bigger than a closed fist and would have travelled at speeds of around 150,000mph. 'When something like that hits the atmosphere, it burns up really brightly,' she said. 'What was unusual about the thing last night is that usually shooting stars are quite small. 'This was quite a large lump passing through the atmosphere so it made quite a large shooting star.' She said the green or blue flame emitted suggested there was copper in the meteor. CCTV cameras in Cardiff also caught sight of the meteor as it travelled across the UK. This image shows a green light that some Twitter users thought was a UFO The fireball would have been one of a number of shooting stars that crossed the sky last night, as the Earth passed through a trail of dust left by Halley's Comet - an event which occurs twice each year. Stargazers can expect to see further meteors - around 10 an hour - streaking through the sky until May 20, Dr Aderin-Pocock said. However, they are likely to decrease in intensity and will only be visible at night and when the skies are relatively clear."

Pyongyang has stepped up its rhetoric against South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak and his government since Kim Jong Un took over as North Korean leader last December after the death of his father, longtime leader Kim Jong Il. The footage and fresh threats against South Korea come just one week after the United States and North Korea agreed on a nuclear deal after years of deadlock. North Korea effectively agreed to freeze its nuclear program and the United States agreed to provide 240,000 metric tons of food aid. The two sides are due to meet Wednesday to discuss the technicalities of the nutritional aid. The United States and South Korea are currently carrying out annual joint military drills, which North Korea has condemned as a provocation. Now Pyongyang is staging its own.

994420,cnn-train-b7212053dac5d1add601797fc1da490daff6a16f,Al-Qidra told CNN that at least one hospital in Gaza was bombed.,SUPPORTS,"[344, 358]",1.0,,,,cnndm/cnn/stories/b7212053dac5d1add601797fc1da490daff6a16f.story,"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Patients being treated on the floor, because emergency rooms are overcrowded, medical sources say. Medicines running low. And, according to a Health Ministry spokesman, fuel shortages such that only half the available ambulances can run and the generators powering lights in hospitals might only last a few more days. Sources there say that is the reality nowadays in Gaza, a dire situation that looks like it will persist or perhaps get worse -- since neither Hamas nor Israel's government have shown any indication of backing down. Rockets being fired from Gaza into Israel are menacing and can be dangerous. Case in point came Friday, when a woman was hurt after a rocket hit a house in Be'er Sheva, according to Israel's military. Every day, there are more such attacks, each one potentially lethal. Earlier Friday, for instance, Israel Defense Forces reported that two soldiers were lightly wounded in an attack by an anti-tank missile. Hostilities between the two sides picked up weeks ago -- tensions that were exacerbated by the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers. There's a disparity in the human toll in the latest fighting. No Israelis have been killed so far by the hundreds of rockets fired toward southern Israel by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups in Gaza. Some Israelis have been wounded. More than 100 people -- including at least 23 children and 24 women -- have been killed and nearly 800 others have been injured in Gaza from Israeli strikes, according to Dr. Ashraf Al-Qidra, the spokesman for Gaza's health ministry. The toll kept rising Saturday, after an Israeli strike in Jabalya in northern Gaza that Hamas security sources said killed members of the Islamic Jihad militant group. Those places where the injured are being treated aren't necessarily safe havens, either: Al-Qidra told CNN that at least one hospital in Gaza was shelled. The medical sources who described the overcrowded emergency rooms in Gaza and dwindling supply of medicine characterized what is happening there as not unlike the chaos witnessed at Syrian hospitals during its civil war. And even those not in hospitals or who haven't been impacted directly by airstrikes face significant challenges. CNN staff in Gaza reported there are rolling blackouts, and there are water shortages in some areas because airstrikes have damaged pumping stations. Israeli authorities insist that they want peace, and that they are striking back in order to defend their territory. As things stand, they contend, doing nothing is not a valid option. To that point, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated Friday that there is one path to a cease-fire: the cessation of attacks from Gaza. Observers wonder whether Israel will escalate its defense with even more offense -- by sending troops into Gaza. Nothing is off the table, Netanyahu said. ""We are considering all options and getting ready for every possible scenario,"" he said. ""All the citizens of Israel are aware of my major goal, and this is to bring back the quiet to all Israeli territories. Hamas keeps attacking us, and therefore we are fighting them back."" Rocket from Lebanon Israel faced attack from a second front Friday, but it is unlikely that a rocket fired from Lebanon signifies the widening of the conflict with Hamas. The rocket launched from Lebanon landed near the northern Israeli town of Metula, which sits right by the Lebanese border, and no damage or injuries have been reported. It was not immediately clear who fired the rocket. An IDF spokesman said Israel holds the Lebanese government responsible for the attack, but concerns that Israel will face a two-front conflict are unlikely to be realized. Hezbollah, which operates in Lebanon and is caught up in other conflicts in the region, probably does not have the appetite to start a war with Israel. Thousands of rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel during a war in 2006, but rocket attacks since then have been sporadic. Tensions are always high between Hezbollah and Israel, but Hezbollah's involvement in Syria's civil war means that a fight with Israel might not make sense. Nonetheless, Israel responded with artillery that landed in the vicinity of the Lebanese town of Kfar Shouba. No casualties were reported, the Lebanese army said. Israel calls up reservists As fears of an Israeli ground assault grew among Gaza residents Thursday, Israel revealed it has beefed up its forces by calling about 30,000 reservists to their units. ""We are utilizing that force to enable us to create a substantial force around Gaza, that if it is required, we'll be able to mobilize as soon as possible,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The Israeli Cabinet has authorized the military to call up 40,000 troops if needed. That is 10,000 more than were called up during Israel's offensive into Gaza in November 2012. The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that since the start of Operation Protective Edge, more than 570 rockets have been fired at Israel. The country's Iron Dome defense system has intercepted more than 100 of them, the IDF said. Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza are believed to have about 10,000 rockets of varying ranges, according to the Israeli military. Israel has said some 3.5 million residents live in areas within reach of the rockets. U.S. willing to help broker cease-fire Hopes for a cease-fire appeared dim even as world leaders called for the two sides to stop the violence. U.S. President Barack Obama and Netanyahu spoke by phone. ""The United States remains prepared to facilitate a cessation of hostilities, including a return to the November 2012 cease-fire agreement,"" the White House said in a written statement, referring to the Egyptian-brokered deal that halted the previous Israel-Hamas conflict. The President also condemned rocket attacks from Gaza and said the United States reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself. From Samson and Delilah to Israeli-Palestinian fighting Flare-up in Israeli-Palestinian violence: Why now? Has the Middle East crisis reached a tipping point? Was teen's death a revenge killing? CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Jerusalem, Mariano Castillo wrote this report in Atlanta, and CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Gaza City.

The pair said the idea for the call came out of a production meeting before their 2DayFM show, the idea being to capitalize on what was the hottest topic in the news, Catherine's pregnancy. The prank has drawn public outrage, which has snowballed since the nurse's death. ""This death is on your conscience,"" reads one post on 2DayFM's Facebook page. Several posters accused Greig and Christian of having ""blood on your hands."" But in their interviews Monday, both stressed that while they made the call to King Edward VII Hospital, they did not have a say on whether it went to air. The call was recorded and then went through a vetting process at their network, Southern Cross Austereo, before it was broadcast, they said. ""This was put through every filter that everything is put through before it makes it to air,"" Christian said in an interview with the program ""A Current Affair."" But Christian said he did not know what that vetting process entailed. ""I'm certainly not aware of what filters it needs to pass through,"" he said. ""Our role is just to record and get the audio,"" Christian said. Greig and Christian said they never expected the prank call to be successful. Death casts glare on 'shock jocks' Posing as Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, the pair said they thought their bad accents would give them away and whoever answered the phone at the hospital would hang up on them. ""We wanted to be hung up on with our silly voices,"" Greig said. ""We assumed that we'd be hung up on, and that would be that,"" Christian said. But they were put through to the duchess's ward and given some details of her medical condition. ""It was never meant to go that far. It was meant to be a silly little prank that so many people have done before,"" Greig said. It was Saldanha who put the call through. ""If we played any involvement in her death, then we're very sorry for that,"" said Greig, who described how she found out about Saldana's apparent suicide. ""It's the worst phone call I've had in my life,"" she said, fighting tears. ""There's not a minute that goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going through, and the thought that we may have played a part in that is gut-wrenching,"" Greig said. The pair have been taken off the air by their network, which has not said when they might return. ""I don't even want to think about going back on air, to be honest,"" Greig said. ""I'm still trying to make sense of it all,"" Christian said. ""We're shattered. We're people, too."" Greig said she'd willingly face Saldanha's family if it would help bring them closure. ""If that's gonna make them feel better, then I'll do what I have to do,"" she said. ""I've thought about this a million times in my head, that I've wanted to just reach out to them and just give them a big hug and say sorry,"" Greig said. ""I hope they're OK, I really do."""

For the 14th time in 20 years Tokyo was found to be the world's most expensive city, having reclaimed the title from Zurich, which topped the table last year thanks to its strong currency. Rising costs of clothing, tobacco and groceries were factors in New York's pricey cost of living Paris was found to be the most expensive in 2010 and Oslo has also placed first in recent years. The stronger U.S. dollar and rising costs of clothing, tobacco and groceries were factors which led to the rise in living costs in New York. Only 12 cities saw a relative rise in the cost of living compared with New York, while 112 cities saw the cost of living relative to New York fall. In the last year Switzerland sought to weaken its franc, meaning Geneva and Zurich saw the biggest falls in living costs. Detroit and Panama City were cities where the cost of living decreased most over the last decade, and it rose most in Caracas and São Paulo. Tokyo came top of the index and was the world's most expensive city for the 14th time in 20 years Despite the gains of the US dollar, the Canadian city of Vancouver remains the most expensive location in North America. The British Columbian capital rose by 15 places in the overall ranking to become 21st most expensive and remains six per cent more expensive than New York. Mumbai and Karachi were the joint cheapest locations surveyed, with indices of just 44 when compared with New York."

Dressed in striped pyjamas and a head covering, Merkel is seen behind barbed wire in Uwazam Rze. The image has intensified a diplomatic war of words between Germany and Poland over wartime guilt. Chancellor Angela Merkel has been portrayed as a concentration camp victim in the controversial magazine cover The magazine ran the picture of Mrs Merkel alongside the headline: 'Falsification of History: How The Germans Made Themselves The Victims of World War II.' The image has been branded tasteless in Germany. Poland has accused its neighbour of distorting historical facts and making victims of the war out of the real criminals. The reason for the allegations is the German TV station ZDF three-part documentary which aired at the end of March 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers'. It focussed on the fate of five Germans in WWII and upset people in Poland after it depicted Polish resistance fighters as anti-Semitic. In one scene a group of fighters orders a train with concentration camp victims to carry on when they realise the passengers are Jewish. In another a partisan says 'we drown Jews like rats.' The Polish ambassador to Berlin was furious at the depiction of Poles as hostile towards Jews in the programme Some Poles have accused Germany of trying to change historical facts in the way the war was portrayed The Polish diplomat in Germany Jerzy Marganski wrote a letter to the TV station after the 14million euro series aired to express his disgust. He wrote: 'The image of Poland and the Polish resistance against the German occupiers as conveyed by this series is perceived by most Poles as extremely unjust and offensive.' Among other criticisms, Marganski said viewers learn nothing of the Warsaw uprising, in which up to 200,000 Polish civilians died, nor of the many Poles who helped Jews. He said the programme gave the impression that more people 'were to blame for the destruction of Jews' than just the Germans. ZDF responded saying that in no way was it intending to trivialise historical facts or reduce German responsibility with the mini series. Producer Nico Hofmann said the depictions of 'the Polish situation... are based on historically vetted material' and there was no intention to defame the Poles.' He said the goal was encourage a national debate about the experiences of war."

There are 100 to 130 additional patient records still to review, according to Sledge. ""We're taking a very aggressive approach and a well-planned intervention to make sure that we're contacting these folks,"" Sledge said. By Tuesday evening, 436 of the 535 patients had been contacted by phone, letters and visits to shelters, according to Sledge. Individuals sought by the center are known to have been treated directly by the clinician between January 1, 1992, and July 28, 2010, according to a release by the medical center. The center is offering free tests to those involved and the clinic will provide all necessary care and treatment without charge should a veteran test positive for the viruses, Sledge said.

Gregory L. Giusti, 48, was charged with making obscene, threatening or harassing phone calls. He was not asked to submit a plea and remained in custody pending a further hearing. A Justice Department news release said the maximum penalty for the charge was two years' imprisonment and a fine of $250,000. Giusti was arrested Wednesday in San Francisco, where Pelosi's home district is located, according to FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler. Pelosi is the top Democrat in the U.S. House and was a leading figure in efforts to win congressional approval of sweeping health care legislation. A statement from Pelosi's office said the arrest occurred ""after an investigation into threats against"" the speaker. It thanked law enforcement officials and said Pelosi would have no further comment at this time. Threats against U.S. senators and representatives increased as Congress completed work last month on the health care bill, which was unanimously opposed by Republicans. In addition, conservative activists around the country protested the bill. Most of the reported threats were against Democrats, though there were some against Republicans. On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced the arrest of a 64-year-old Washington state resident for allegedly issuing death threats against Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, who supported the health care bill. A department statement said the suspect, identified as Charles Alan Wilson of Selah, Washington, made the threats in phone messages to Murray's office between March 22 and April 4. Wilson allegedly stated that Murray ""had a target on her back"" and that he wanted to kill her, according to the statement, which said the threats were in response to congressional passage of the health care bill.

Employees bemoan the company’s lack of privacy, hate having to listen to people whine to them about Facebook, and wonder whether this website they spend so much time with is really worth the screen it’s displayed on. Though the Palo Alto, California company was given the designation of best overall tech company to work for by employment site Glassdoor.com, its employee complaints will sound familiar to anyone who’s ever held a job or simply logged onto the social media site. The grind: The reception at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California. Though the company was recently voted best tech company to work for, employees still complain 'Forget the free food and drinks,' is among the complaints of one Quora user in answer to the question ‘What's the worst thing about working at Facebook?’ on the Q&A website. Free food, managers who encourage personal expression, and wide open offices are all part of what consistently earns Facebook 'best place to work' designations but those same qualities can wear on employees' nerves. 'The workplace is awful,' the employee continued. ‘Huge rooms filled with rows and rows of picnic style tables with people sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with six inches of separation and zero privacy.' Privacy was a big issue among employees who contributed to the post, something that will come as no surprise to users who've complained for years of the company's privacy policies. 'Like cattle': Employees say the office's open floor plan offers little privacy at work, a complaint many office workers in any industry can relate to Sound familiar? One employee said Facebook top brass Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg impose a 'holier than thou attitude on everyone and everything around them' Hearing the corporate office mentality reflects the way Facebook treats its users is hardly a revelation. Meanwhile, it is hard to feel completely bad for exposed Facebook employees, where even interns make $5,602 per month according to Business Insider. ‘That's how you keep cattle in the pen,’ continued the employee, ‘not high quality talent earning low to mid six figures.’ Also, social politics play too big a role for some employees’ tastes. Many complain about having to hear people’s opinions about Facebook all the time from users just because they work there. Not even their spouses are immune. ‘As a Facebook spouse,’ began an employee’s wife, ‘I was often asked for help on how to use the privacy settings solely on the basis that, being married to someone who works at Facebook, I must know.’ 'Overhyped': One employee bemoaned his time working for the company as wasted - with its 'dismal public offering' and 'realizing the company doesn't really have a future' Employees also said attitude issue extends to the top of the company, where ‘Zuck and Sheryl,’ wrote an employee,  impose a ‘holier than thou attitude on everyone and everything around them.’ Another employee wrote: ‘The tone of voice people used was belittling and self-righteous.' And finally, the much ballyhooed and, for a time, maligned initial public also offering figured into many complaints. Like users wondering if spending hour after hour on the social media site is a waste of time, so too do some employees fear they’re wasting their professional lives. ‘Knowing that you are part of an overhyped public company that was supposed to be valued over $200 billion by now,’ cites another anonymous Quora user in list of Facebook complaints, ‘but which had a dismal public offering that left many employees feeling totally helpless as they saw the value of their stock collapse.’ Despite the many issues employees who contributes to the Quora post took with Facebook, most reflected the Glassdoor.com’s positive take on the company, not least of all its free three meal-per-day perk. ‘It's a truly fantastic place to work,’ wrote one user. Another said his top complaint was ‘That I have but one stomach for all the food.’"

Hannah Rinehart, 32, who had battled through three bouts of cancer before being struck down with an infection caught from her puppy on July 3rd, passed away from multiple organ failure at Northside Hospital in Cumming in the early hours of Wednesday. Spending nine weeks in a medically-induced coma after going into septic shock, Rinehart's passing was announced by her husband Mark as he wrote on his Facebook page, 'At exactly 0415 this morning, Hannah Johnson Rinehart went to be with the Lord.' Scroll Down for Video Hannah Rinehart has passed away at Northside Hospital in Cumming in the early hours of Wednesday after battling a rare bacterial infection. Her husband Mark (right) was at her side Hannah Rinehart's story had made national headlines earlier in the month when her husband battled to extend the 20 days of sick leave he was entitled to annually. Anticipating that his wife would need round the clock care if she recovered, Mark Rinehart was ultimately denied any exceptions and was told that he would have only have 20 days. This was despite his co-workers offering to donate their own sick leave time to him so that he could be be by his wife's side during her convalesence, but they were told they could not do that. In late August, Mark Rinehart did return to work for the start of the new academic year, calling it a 'difficult, but necessary decision.' Hannah Rinehart suffered multiple organ failure as the sepsis she suffered from her bacterial infection caused damage to her heart and lungs Fighter: Hannah was more susceptible to the infection as her immune system was weakened by two bouts of cancer - Hodgkin's lymphoma - and subsequent bone marrow transplants Updating his Facebook on Tuesday to say that he was taking the 20 days from that point on, tragically his wife died less than 24 hours after he made that decision. It is thought that Rinehart contracted capnocytophaga, an infection usually found in the saliva of dogs. Her husband Mark said he did not know if their one-year-old dog, Brownie, bit her. 'It was basically like being struck by lightning,' Mr Rinehart told the Gwinnett Daily Post. 'It doesn’t happen.' As the sepsis set in doctors were forced to amputate the nurse's hands and feet after her body went into shock and she suffered circulatory problems. Staying in a medically induced coma for over two months before her death, the effects of her illness had ravaged her body. Battle: Hannah Rinehart, pictured with her husband Mark and their dog Brownie, had both hands and feet removed after she caught a rare infection from the puppy's saliva 'The doctor wanted to meet with the entire family, and my assumption was that the meeting would be very difficult,' said a Facebook update from Mark Rinehart yesterday afternoon. Hannah Rinehart became ill after contracting capnocytophaga. It had a significant effect as her immune system had been weakened by cancer and two bone marrow transplants.The rare infection is only usually a danger to elderly, infirm or those with underlying diseases.Capnocytophaga is found in the throat of mammals and can be passed to humans through bite wounds.The bacteria can cause septicemia, meningitis, rare eye infections and endocarditis - an inflammation of the heart.Symptoms often include fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, confusion, muscle pain or malaise. It can also bring on septic shock.When discovered, it can be treated with anti-microbial medications. 'The family’s immediate reaction to the meeting was a sigh of relief, as no new decisions needed to be made. 'However, the message from the doctor was clear; Hannah is in critical condition and she has been in ICU for 9 weeks. As such, Hannah is very, very tired. 'Unfortunately, Hannah’s current circumstances are limiting our options. 'Many people have asked if Hannah is a candidate for lung transplant.

'Even prior to our trip to the ICU in early July, Hannah’s heart condition from her cancer treatments (cardiomyopathy – ‘weak heart muscle’) would prevent her from being a candidate.' Hannah Rinehart had beaten cancer three times since the age of 18; she suffered from Hodgkin’s lymphoma and was in remission for seven years.

Despite these struggles, her husband, a schoolteacher and national guardsman, said she has always been upbeat. 'You see people around who have had a tough time and are bitter about it,' Mr Rinehart told WXIA. 'She's not; she's always excited about living. She's a fighter, I married a fighter. 'It's just another stage in our life. I know when she comes out of this she's going to be smiling just as big as she was before.' He added to Fox: 'She's got a passion for living and she was grateful for every day she had after [cancer] and she's going to be grateful for every day she has after this.'

They claim Britain is ‘the fat man of Europe’ and the problems have set in by the age of nine. A report also says the UK’s child death rate is the second worst in western Europe, with an estimated five extra deaths a day compared with the best performing country. Scroll down for video British girls under 20 are the fattest in Europe – topping a league table of 22 nations in Western Europe One in 10 children – around three in every classroom – has a diagnosable mental health condition but even those identified are often not treated properly. In a wide-ranging report, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), which represents doctors specialising in children and young people, issues a wake-up call to politicians. It says childhood obesity statistics ‘continue to cause alarm’ with 26 per cent of boys and 29 per cent of girls overweight and obese ‘storing up serious health problems for the future’. British girls under 20 are the fattest in Europe – topping a league table of 22 nations in Western Europe. British boys under 20 are 10th in the league table, with Greece at the top where one-third of boys are ranked as fat. British boys are 10th in the league table, with Greece at the top of the list as one-third are ranked as fat Recent research for the period 1980-2013 says there has been a substantial increase in overweight and obese children and adolescents in developed countries, including the UK. The RCPCH wants a ban on advertising of foods high in saturated fats, sugar and salt before 9pm, and restrictions that stop them being advertised on internet ‘on-demand’ services. Food and nutrition training should be mandatory for teachers as part of a bid to improve children’s diet in schools, along with more activity for children promoted via more cycle lanes and 20mph speed limits. The Vision2015 report says death rates of children under five are second to bottom in a league table of 21 nations, at 4.9 deaths per 1,000 children born compared with 7.0 in Malta. The RCPCH wants a ban on advertising of foods high in saturated fats, sugar and salt before 9pm, and restrictions that stop them being advertised on internet ‘on-demand’ services The number of needless deaths among preschool children is similar up to the age of 14, with five extra dying each year who would not die in Sweden, among the best performing countries. The number of children dying needlessly each year in the UK compared with Sweden amounts to almost 2,000 each year. RCPCH President Dr Hilary Cass said there would be ‘serious consequences’ if no concerted effort is made by the next Government to improve children and young people’s health. She said politicians must give a similar priority to young people that had been awarded to the elderly. She said ‘The main focus of health and social care policy from successive Government has been on meeting the needs of an ageing population. ‘Many of the big ticket policies – such as pension increases, winter fuel allowances and free TV licences - have made a welcome difference to many older people We now want to see equal focus given to our younger population. ‘Not only should this be done because it directly benefits children and young people but also because it will improve the health of the nation as a whole. ‘Healthy children are more likely to be healthy adults – and of course the reverse is also true.’ Lisa Murphy, a member of the RCPCH’s Youth Advisory Panel, said the health of young people in the UK has been falling behind the rest of Europe’ for too long’. She said ‘There is an overwhelming body of evidence which highlights the need for early intervention in ensuring good health - through integration of health and education, reduction of socioeconomic inequalities and mandatory provision of paediatric training for all those in community health services.’"

The project at Holy Trinity Primary School in Halstead, Essex, revolved around a 3ft-high egg found in undergrowth on school grounds and was part of a problem solving exercise. Despite assurances that the 'amazing discovery' was '100 per cent safe', some of the school's 250 pupils were so frightened by the egg that headmaster Jon Smith had to issue an apology after parents reported their children were distressed, and even suffering from nightmares. Project: The headteacher of  Holy Trinity Primary School in Halstead, Essex, has apologised after some pupils were frightened by a project involving the 'discovery' of a giant egg on school grounds As part of the project, which took place last month, parents were sent letter reporting how the egg had been found, and that a scientist from the 'National Museum Of Strange Objects' was coming to investigate it. 'I am pleased to inform you that the inspection has confirmed that the area and object are 100 per cent safe and pose no threat whatsoever to the public,' Mr Smith wrote in his mock alert. 'What still isn’t clear however, is the identity of the object.' He then said that the museum's Dr Violet Strangeways had asked that all children 'remain vigilant and put all their energies into research and investigation in order to help the museum ascertain the origins of this amazing discovery'. Worry: Some parents  at the school reported that their children had been upset by the 'discovery' of the egg Apology: Headteacher Jon Smith sent out this apology to parents whose children had been worried by the egg stunt As part of the project the children had to question where the egg might have come from, drawing pictures and writing essays on its provenance, with parents kept up to date on their project. However, a post on the school's Facebook page and Twitter account soon began attracting comments from some parents who reported that their children had been frightened. One parent wrote: '@HTPSHalstead tell me I'm not the only parent whose child hasn't eaten lunch & has been in tears about the ""discovery"" ? Prank too far?' 'It has come to our attention that whilst the vast majority of the children at school were excited and engaged by this morning’s ""discovery"" there are some who have been worried by it' Jon Smith, Headteacher Another added: '@HTPSHalstead glad you said that my son does not want to go to school anymore and has been in tears since he come home #nothappy.' Although the majority of parents writing on the school's Facebook page said their children had been excited by the project, with the pupils speculating that the egg could be that of a dinosaur or dragon, others said that some younger children had been scared by it. One commented: 'He is scared of his own shadow and has been to sleep earlier but woke up at 9.20pm after having a nightmare!' Others said their children had been afraid to go to bed, with one mother writing: 'Holy trinity..........i hope this doesn't go on all week!!!!! I'm gona have 2 tired children!!!!!!!' Within hours of the initial post, Mr Smith had issued another letter, apologising to parents if their children had been upset by the egg. 'It has come to our attention that whilst the vast majority of the children at school were excited and engaged by this morning’s ""discovery"" there are some who have been worried by it,' he said in a second letter issued on June 16. School grounds: The well-meaning project revolved around a 3ft-high egg found in undergrowth on school grounds and was part of a problem solving exercise 'We assure you that this afternoon we held an extra whole school assembly where we made it absolutely clear to everyone that the egg was of no danger to anyone, that it was safe to keep in school, and that we would therefore be able to observe it further tomorrow. 'We apologise if that message did not come through sufficiently and, as planned, in the follow-up assembly in the morning we will place further emphasis on it being of absolutely no danger whatsoever. 'During the course of today the children have produced an enormous amount of high quality work, in a variety of forms, related to the egg and it was great to see them so engaged. Such ""discoveries"" are quite common in primary schools across the country and are a very successful way of promoting problem solving, teamwork, group discussion and PSHE-related topics. This activity is part of our ""No Problem"" theme this term.' Holy Trinity Primary School had not responded to MailOnline's requests for comment at the time of publication."

Haynesworth, 29, was free to leave after signing the warrant and is scheduled to appear at the Fairfax County Criminal Court on March 31, the Fairfax County Police Department said. The charge stems from an allegation by an unnamed driver who said Haynesworth punched him February 2 while they were driving on the Fairfax County Parkway, police said. The motorist told police the driver of a pickup truck -- whom police later determined to be Haynesworth -- was tailgating him, so he delivered a ""nonverbal hand gesture"" to the driver, Officer Shelley Broderick said. The man told police that when the two stopped at a red light, Haynesworth got out of the truck and the two briefly exchanged words before Haynesworth threw a punch, according to Broderick. The man called police. After making a statement, he drove himself to a hospital for treatment of minor injuries, Broderick said. Police said officers interviewed Haynesworth on Saturday at the Reston District Police Station before he signed the warrant. Haynesworth's agent, Chad Speck, said last week it was the other driver who instigated the incident and called the accusation ""ridiculous."" In Virginia, simple assault is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 12 months in jail and a $2,500 fine."

French photographer Léo Calliard, 27, from Paris, teamed up with digital imaging retoucher Alexis Persani to dress the Greek Agora masterpieces in clothes more likely to be seen on Shoreditch hipsters. 'I had this idea when I was walking in the Louvre Museum looking at different sculptures,' Calliard tells MailOnline. 'These sculptures represent most of the time Gods or important people very far from our every day life. To make them ""iconic"", their sculptor made them naked, without any element from a specific period of time. Leo's Renaissance sculptures in clothes tell a meaningful story while providing hilarious viewing Le Faune Barberini suns himself and relaxes in the nude in the original version of the statue 'I realised that it would make a great series of pictures if I could dress these statues up. Of course, it was impossible to do it in real life as the museum wouldn't let me touch the statues.' 'I started to think about the way to do it and I finally found the right process. I made a casting of models to find people with the same body shape as the statues. Then, I did a photoshoot in a studio with these models dressed in hipster clothing. 'The important part of the shooting was to recreate the same light on the models and to ask them to pose in the same was as the statue they were representing. After that, it was possible to mix both pictures in post-production, using Photoshop to take the clothes from the studio shoot and put them on the pictures of the statues that I shot in the museum.' A fine Greek Agora statue is kitted out in rolled up hems and rolled up sleeves for the Shoreditch effect The original Aristaeus by Joseph Bosio is a nude sculpture In line with his childhood fascination with Einstein’s relativity research and study of environments and imagines with the idea that reality 'might not be as we see it', Calliard changes the way we perceive these classic figures. Le Faune Barberini by Edmé Bouchardon leans back wearing green rolled up trousers, a bomber jacket and neon shades while Michel de Montaigne by Jean-Baptist Stouf looks dapper in a blue plaid shirt and Ray-Ban sunglasses. Aristaeus, God of the gardens by Artist François Joseph Bosio leans on a rock while appearing to wear a tight blue shirt with rolled up sleeves, rolled up trousers and trendy shades as Meleagre by Louis Simon Boizot is kitted out in rolled up orange shorts and a denim shirt. The work forces the viewer to question what is real and what could be real. Mums can be hipsters too: A female sculpture in Lennon shades and a faded band tee tends to her baby Grandfather of hip: In a tight checked shirt and Ray Bans a philosophical type older figure becomes trends Writing of his project, Callard says: 'Who is to say that the figures presented in the stone of Greek Agora were not the greatest representation of the human form known at that time? 'The statues, with their clothes stripped away reveal a magnificence of shape & balance. But what were the Greeks wearing when they weren't posing for sculptors..? 'Appearance, in all its many nuances, present the character. 'Clothes maketh the man' as William Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet. 'One’s dress sense indicates one's priorities, choices, and lifestyle. Are you 'in' or are you 'out'? 'Hipster or Classic? Which tribe are you a member of? Which tribe were the men posing for these statues from?' Hipsters In Stone presents a twist on themes taking the ultimate from the Classic world and adding a modern, contemporary twist with cropped trousers, Ray-Bans and plaid shirts - 'making the icons iconic'. The throwaway cotton skater dress is a hipster girl's wardrobe staple. This classic statue works the look Leo 'takes the ultimate from the Classic world and adds a modern, contemporary twist' Meleagre by Louis Simon looks a lot less hipster and more cherub-like in real life Calliard produces 30 x 45 inch prints of each statue mounted with plexiglass for £1,500 each.

The protest, held in Douma, near Damascus, aims to draw attention to Syrians living under siege and dying from air strikes by forces loyal to Assad. It also condemned the lack of international action compared to that given to the fight against ISIS. It comes after more than 180 people - 55 of them women and children - were killed in Douma in the first ten days of this month by regime air strikes, according to British-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Syrian rebel groups vowed over the weekend to retaliate by stepping up rocket attacks against regime-held areas. Speaking in a rare interview last week, Assad denied using barrel bombs against his own people - something human rights groups have accused him of doing throughout the four-year civil war. The defiant tyrant has always denied claims of such atrocities, including allegations that chemical weapons were used in an attack outside the capital in 2013 that killed up to 1,400 people. The children, some of whom were as young as three, held banners reading: 'Stop the killing of children' The protest, held in Douma, near Damascus, aims to draw attention to Syrians living under siege and dying from air strikes by forces loyal to Assad SOHR said yesterday that heavy fighting in southern Syria has killed scores of pro-government and insurgent fighters in the past week, forecasting even fiercer violence as the weather clears. Syria's army and allied combatants from Lebanon's Hezbollah launched a large-scale offensive in the region last week against insurgent groups, including al Qaeda's Syria wing Nusra Front and non-jihadist rebels. Southern Syria is one of the last areas where mainstream rebels opposing President Assad have a foothold. They have lost ground to hardline Islamist militants in the four-year conflict. More than 50 rebels have been killed in the fighting, the head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Rami Abdulrahman said 43 members of the Syrian army and allied groups had also died, including 12 officers. 'Now the weather is better there will be Syrian air strikes. With the air strikes they will move forward,' he said. The protest echoed the brutal death of Lt Moaz al-Kasasbeh (above) in a ISIS video released earlier this month Barbaric: An ISIS extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26-year-old stands State news agency SANA said Syrian forces had inflicted 'heavy losses' on 'terrorist groups' in Deraa on Sunday after killing many enemy fighters and destroying their vehicles the previous day. Syrian officials were not immediately available for comment on Sunday. State media and Hezbollah's al-Manar channel have carried regular reports on the fighting in the south. Abdulrahman, who tracks the war using sources on the ground, said around 5,000 pro-government troops were taking part in the offensive, which aims to take a triangle of rebel-held land from rural areas southwest of Damascus to Deraa city to Quneitra. Sources on both sides of the battlefront have said the offensive aims to shield Damascus, the capital, which is a short drive to the north.

'The situation remains hit-and-run between us and regime forces,' said Abu Gaiath, a spokesman for the rebel Alwiyat Seif al-Sham group. Its fighters are part of the 'Southern Front' rebel alliance that has had support from states opposed to Assad. Speaking via the Internet from inside Syria, he said fighting had calmed in the past two days but the military was aiming to encircle a village northeast of Quneitra and had captured towns and villages south of Damascus. The Observatory's Abdulrahman said 10 fighters on the government side had been executed after being accused of passing information to the enemy. He also said Nusra Front fighters had been killed in battle but exact numbers were not known. Winter weather had curtailed fighting in the past few days and prevented air strikes, one of the army's most potent weapons against insurgents. Abdulrahman said the army and allied groups planned to involve 10,000 fighters in the offensive. 'Who threw that gas on who?' President Assad also denied claims that Syria's government had used chemical weapons against its own people in August 2013 in an attack outside the capital that killed up to 1,400 people"

Patients in NHS Grampian hospitals have just 89p spent on them for a two-course meal on average - although it does rise to £2.17 on December 25. Inmates at the £150million HMP Grampian, in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, will be tucking into Chicken Balmoral and chocolate gateau on Christmas Day at a cost of £2.47 per prisoner While taxpayers will pay £2.47 per prisoner per meal at the £150million HMP Grampian (pictured), patients in NHS Grampian hospitals will have just £2.17 spent on their Christmas meals The difference in price has already been branded 'bizarre' by campaigners. Eben Wilson, of TaxpayerScotland, said: 'This bizarre revelation just shows us the level of control the state has on our money. 'Obviously, we would like to think that patients would be treated more favourably at Christmas than convicted criminals. 'It seems like it is the season of goodwill for some men and not others.' Prisoners were given menu sheets covering four days - Christmas, Boxing Day, New Year's Day and January 2. On December 25 they will have the choice of either chicken Balmoral or a mushroom, brie and hazelnut wellington for their main course. Their brightly coloured menus feature pictures of Father Christmas, holly, sheep and bells with space at the top for the prisoner to write in their name, number and which wing they live in. Inmates were also handed a wordsearch with movie titles to keep them occupied in their cells. For their Boxing Day meal, they can choose between a burger, a pizza, lasagne or curry. The New Year's Day selection features either a steak pie or a nut roast slice. For their Boxing Day meal (left), they can choose between a burger, a pizza, lasagne or curry. A menu for January 2 (right) features a kebab, fish cakes, ginger sponge  and macaroni cheese The cost of hospital patients food on Christmas Day rises to £2.17 for the main meal of the day with patients offered the choice of four dishes, including turkey with trimmings. In the evening, a cold buffet style tea is provided for patients at a food cost of approximately £1.79 each. Peterhead councillor Alan Buchan, a vocal critic of the prison, said: 'Peterhead has six of ten of the most deprived areas of Aberdeenshire in it including the most deprived area. 'I have constituents who can't afford to switch on the heating never mind eat all this fancy food. 'Meanwhile, these prisoners get underfloor heating, football pitches, a gym and all the comforts of home. 'It's ridiculous that the poorest people are treated worse than criminals.' However, a prison source has revealed that some prisoners are complaining that sex offenders and violent criminals are getting the same treats as them. The source said: 'Lots of these guys inside are happy being locked up because they get three square meals a day and usually a better telly than at home. 'They know they have it better than if they were on the dole outside - they read the papers and know about the poverty in the UK. The latest revelation about life inside Scotland's newest prison comes just days after it was revealed that nearly 300 complaints had been made by inmates since it opened in March Inmates were also handed a wordsearch with movie titles to keep them occupied in their cells 'They wouldn't get chicken Balmoral on Christmas day if they were just getting benefits.' But Margaret Mitchell MSP, Tory justice spokesperson, defended the costs as 'reasonable'. She said: 'There could be many mitigating factors simply by the fact that ill people can't eat as much as those who are well. 'Prison has to be as much about rehabilitation as punishment and giving the prisoners the odd special day is a key part to reintegrating them into society.' A spokeswoman from the Scottish Prison Service said: 'All offenders are offered the same choices, these can vary depending on the establishment. 'The average cost per adult prisoner per day which is £2.47 per day - young offenders get slightly more at £2.75.' The latest revelation about life inside Scotland's newest prison comes just days after it was revealed that nearly 300 complaints had been made by inmates since it opened in March. Inmates have lodged complaints about food, laundry and even the gym facilities. The figures, released through Freedom of Information legislation, revealed how 292 complaints have been filed - an average of more than one a day."

Twitter now occupies seven of the 11 floors in the 77-year-old SF mart building, and bought the 1800s homesteader cabin to go along with the cafeteria's forest theme. 'We've used the notion of the forest as a nice tie-in with Twitter and its bird logo,' office designer Olle Lundberg told MarinIj.com. Home, home on the Twitter range: An 1800s log cabin was unveiled in Twitter's new cafeteria headquarters on Monday Decked out: The interior of the cabin features seating for workers to eat lunch and TV monitors for entertainment Farm to table: Twitter's office designer purchased the century-old cabin for an undisclosed amount from a local contractor who salvages them from remote Montana ranches Growing: Twitter now occupies seven of the 11 floors in the 77-year-old SF Mart building The unveiling alco coincided with the 149-year anniversary of the day President Abraham Lincoln was shot - perhaps the most famous person to have lived in a log cabin. The president was born in a one-room cabin in Kentucky and Lincoln Logs, the children's building blocks, are named after him. The timing of the unveiling seems to have been a coincidence. Mr Lundberg purchased the log cabin from a Novato, California contractor who salvages them from remote Montana ranches. 'We advertised them for a year and we pretty much got a lot of crackpot calls,' contractor Karl Beckmann said. 'When you think about it, buying a 100-year-old log cabin that has been exposed to the elements is not a very practical idea unless you're doing something exactly like what is being done here.' While the price of the cabin was never released, Tech Crunch found a 'more down market version' selling for around $12,500.

The cabin was outfitted with booths and a center pillar with TV monitors and a coffee station. 'You can see the hand of the original craftsmen who built them,' Mr Lundberg said. 'It's kind of cool that cabins that were built sometime in the 1800s have now reappeared. The guys who built them are long dead, of course, but are sort of still here. I kind of like that.'

This week, Putin signed an executive order to bring back the Ready for Labor and Defence programme, to improve the fitness of the population. The Russian President, who in 2008 released an instructional judo DVD called 'Let's Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin', will use unused funds from the Sochi Olympics to revive the plan. Scroll down for video All together now: The Russian president leads by example, and has even released released an instructional judo DVD called 'Let's Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin' Speaking in the Kremlin on Monday, Putin said that reinstating the plan, first introduced in the 1930s under Joseph Stalin and known in Russia by the acronym GTO, would ‘pay homage to our national historical traditions’. During the Soviet days, Russians of all ages were expected to participate in GTO. In the final years of high school education, teenagers were enlisted in the Strength and Courage-programme, where they would undergo basic military training. Men aged 40 to 50, and women aged 35-55, would take part in the Vigor and Health-programme, and local branches of GTO would hold their own annual championships. This week Putin said the leftover Sochi funds support sports venues and promote healthy lifestyles among Russians from the age of six. People's (healthy) President: Vladimir Putin, pictured riding a horse during during his holidays in Southern Siberia, wants to encourage his people to exercise Point and shoot: Putin will use leftover funds from the Sochi Olympics to pay for the new mass-exercise programme ‘The Olympics and Paralympics have demonstrated that we are again becoming one of the leaders in global sports,’ Putin said, after his country hosted the $50-billion games. Putin frequently harks back to the Soviet era to appeal to nostalgic Russians, and the move coincides with the recent annexation of Crimea. Bioth the U.S. and the EU have imposed sanctions on Russia over the move, even excluding Putin from the G8 group. However, the annexation of Crimea has boosted Putin's popularity at home, where almost half of Russians said the move, according to a poll by the independent Levada Center published earlier this month. Putin's own approval ratings were at 72 per cent, up from 65 per cent at the beginning of the year, according to another poll published by Levada this month. The president has been seeking to increase Russians' life expectancy and stem a demographic decline that has seen the population fall to below 142 million in 2011 from 148.6 million in 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed."

Oxford comes top after producing 401 alumni worth £20million or more, and Cambridge is in second place with 361 - but Cambridge has the most billionaires. The average super-rich graduate from Cambridge has a fortune of £169million, more than twice as much as Oxford's ultra-wealthy ex-students. Three London universities make up the rest of the list's top five, with Manchester, Nottingham and Birmingham also appearing high on the list. Topping the list: Oxford has more super-wealthy graduates than any other British university as 401 of its alumni have amassed fortunes of more than £20million, with an average of £83million each Wealth: Cambridge has produced 361 multi-millionaire alumni worth an average of £169million each Cambridge's wealthy alumni, including Cobra Beer entrepreneur Lord Bilimoria, actor Sacha Baron Cohen and former Barclays chairman Marcus Agius, have a combined wealth of £61billion, according to the study by wealth analyst Wealth-X. The average super-rich Oxford graduate, a group including the likes of financier Nat Rothschild, Lastminute.com founder Martha Lane Fox and comedian Michael Palin, is worth £83million. 1) Oxford - 401 super-rich graduates worth an average £83m each - alumni include Monty Python comedian Michael Palin 2) Cambridge - 361, £169m - including Borat actor Sacha Baron Cohen 3) LSE - 273, £84m - including Rolling Stones singer Sir Mick Jagger 4) Imperial - 127, £67m - including Queen guitarist Brian May 5) London Business School - 106, £99m - including Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry 6) Manchester - 102, £22m - including former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy 7) UCL - 99, £29m - including comic and actor Ricky Gervais 8) Nottingham - 92, £22m - including head of MI5 Sir John Sawers 9) Edinburgh - 80, £52m - including Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy 10) Birmingham - 68, £69m - including Manchester United CEO David Gill The list was compiled by counting up the number of former students from each university who are believed to be worth at least £20million, taking into account their earnings, properties and other assets London universities occupy the rest of the list's top five, with London School of Economics, Imperial College London and London Business School in third, fourth and fifth place. While London Business School may be best-known for its successful business leaders such as Cyrus Mistry, chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Teas, it also boasts political graduates such as minister and Tory MP for Putney Justine Greening. The only other institution to boast more than 100 mega-rich alumni is the University of Manchester. However, on a global scale the Oxbridge universities are the only British institutions to make the cut, with 17 of the top 20 wealth creators being from the U.S. Despite the reputation of Oxford and Cambridge as bastions of the aristocratic elite, relatively few of their multi-millionaires inherited their wealth. More than two thirds of Oxbridge alumni worth more than £20million made their fortunes through their own efforts with no help from their families. At the University of Edinburgh, by contrast, fewer than half made their millions thanks to an entrepreneurial spirit, with the majority relying on an inheritance to build their own fortune. The University of Birmingham is where the most self-made millionaires can be found - 84 per cent of its super-rich graduates became wealthy on their own. Entrepreneurial: 84 per cent of the 68 super-rich from the University of Birmingham, pictured, made their money themselves without inheriting from their families Contrast: At the University of Edinburgh, fewer than half the 80 multi-millionaire alumni made their money without help from their families Oxford: Wealthy alumni of the university include financier Nat Rothschild, who is worth £700million, and entrepreneur Martha Lane Fox, believed to have a £300million fortune; both of them studied history 1) Harvard University - 2,964 alumni worth a total of $622bn 2) University of Pennsylvania - 1,502 alumni worth $242bn 3) Stanford University - 1,174 alumni worth $171bn 4) Columbia University - 889 alumni worth $116bn 5) New York University - 828 alumni worth $110bn 6) University of Chicago - 658 alumni worth $144bn 7) Massachusetts Institute of Technology - 581 alumni worth $172bn 8) Yale University - 568 alumni worth $125bn 9) Cornell University - 528 alumni worth $60bn 10) Princeton University - 508 alumni worth $70bn 11) University of Virginia - 499 alumni worth $31bn 12) Boston University - 291 alumni worth $38bn 13) Northwestern University - 451 alumni worth $36bn 14) University of California, Berkeley - 447 alumni worth $72bn 15) University of Michigan - 410 alumni worth $70bn 16) University of Oxford - 401 alumni worth $51bn 17) University of Southern California - 374 alumni worth $66bn 18) University of Mumbai - 372 alumni worth $37bn 19) University of Cambridge - 361 alumni worth $93bn 20) Brown University - 349 alumni worth $23bn Previous research has suggested that the most lucrative subjects to study are medicine, law and engineering, which all give their students a significant earnings boost over the course of their careers. The least well-paying degrees are the arts and humanities - but that did not stop history graduates like Mr Baron Cohen and Lady Lane Fox from becoming extremely wealthy. The overwhelming majority of 'ultra-high-net-worth individuals' from British universities are male, with just one in 11 of them being women. For Oxford graduates, the situation is even more one-sided - 94 per cent of its super-wealthy alumni are men. Cambridge: Actor Sacha Baron Cohen, a former history student, and beer mogul Lord Bilimoria, who studied law have both amassed large fortunes - nearly £70million and as much as £80million respectively Number three: The London School of Economics has 273 super-rich alumni including singer Mick Jagger, who took courses in business at the university Number four: Among the 127 multi-millionaires produced by Imperial College London are Queen's Brian May, a noted scientist with a PhD in astrophysics While higher education in the UK clearly deserves some of the credit for the success of its alumni, the average super-rich graduate is well out of university at the age of 57. Mike Byrne of Wealth-X said the findings showed that future business leaders were still attracted to British universities. '17 out of the 24 Russell Group universities are featured in the report, which reflects the ability of such prestigious institutions to attract high-calibre individuals, who proceed to create financial success,' he said. Despite the strong showing of many British institutions, the U.S. dominates the global rich list - Harvard, in top spot, has almost 3,000 graduates worth more than £20million, nearly twice as many as second-placed Penn. Oxford stands at number 16 in the international list, with Cambridge at number 19. The majority of institutions on the global version of the list are private universities in the U.S., including Ivy League colleges such as Columbia, Yale, Cornell, Princeton and Brown. The only American public universities with more than 350 super-rich alumni are the University of Virginia, the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan. The one entry on the list from outside the U.S. and the UK may be surprising - it is the University of Mumbai, which despite being located in a Third World country has 372 alumni worth more than £20million. The university has long been popular with the children of India's wealthy elite, and its former students include billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani and legendary former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar."

Customers blame TNT Post for missed hospital appointments, lost bills and delayed medical test results. The company’s orange-clad staff are paid according to how quick they are – giving them an incentive to ditch mail. Letters have been found dumped in undergrowth in Manchester and London. Cache: Police officers found this pile of TNT mail in undergrowth in Sale, Manchester Stash: Chris Elsdale came across 250 letters by a reservoir in Brent, London TNT Post began its delivery operations in west London in April 2012 and has expanded into other parts of the capital as well as to Manchester and Liverpool. It hopes to reach 40 per cent of UK households within three years. Unlike Royal Mail, which must deliver 93 per cent of first-class letters on the next working day, TNT Post is not subject to strict rules laid down by the industry regulator Ofcom. One source said: ‘TNT Post can  literally do what it likes.’ Under fire: TNT Post began door-to-door deliveries two years ago To add to the  chaos, people who find letters dumped or wrongly delivered by TNT Post typically put them into a Royal Mail postbox. Royal Mail will then levy a £1.53 surcharge – to the fury of recipients. Clare Yabsley, a mother of two from Hammersmith, west London, says she missed two important hospital letters because of failings by TNT Post. One related to her 20-month-old daughter Mia, who was born with a hole in her heart. The 48-year-old knew something was amiss only when a letter arrived from Chelsea & Westminster Hospital asking why she had not turned up to an appointment. She said: ‘When I phoned the hospital, which has been fantastic, they said it happens all the time. ‘It is such a waste of hospital appointments. If it has happened twice to me, how many other people has it happened to?’ On the other occasion a letter with medical test results failed to arrive with Mrs Yabsley having to rely on the copy later sent to her GP. Susan Hall, leader of Harrow Council, had to apologise to residents following delays by TNT Post in delivering council tax notices. It cost the London borough £13,000 to write to the 24,000 residents who had been affected by the payment date blunder. Salford City Council, which also uses TNT Post, had similar difficulties with a council tax mailout to 110,000 homes because of a problem with a franking machine. Chris Elsdale was walking her two dogs by the Welsh Harp Reservoir in Brent, north London, when she spotted a pile of around 250 letters under a bush. Over the next 12 days, she telephoned TNT Post repeatedly – about eight or nine times – to urge them to come and pick up the mail. But the pile of letters remained where she had first spotted them. She was told by one worker at TNT Post the bushes were too ‘thorny’ to tackle. She became so frustrated she went into the bushes herself, put all the letters into a bag and called TNT Post again to pick them up, which they did. Of the 250 items of mail, Mrs Elsdale said just ten were junk mail. The rest were from banks, energy companies, credit card providers and hospitals. Mrs Elsdale, 55, a director of a photography business, said: ‘Each and every letter had an effect on somebody’s life. ‘You can’t leave personal bank details lying under a bush for 12 days.’ She said she felt ‘very strongly’ that a company which is entrusted to handle the post must have ‘a policy and procedure that sorts out what has gone wrong in  24 hours’. TNT Post said it was ‘very grateful to Mrs Elsdale for working with us to get the issue resolved’. A Royal Mail postman from Manchester said: ‘I constantly find mail sticking out of letter boxes and have to post it through to enable me to deliver our mail behind it. I see items of mail strewn in the street or thrown on doorsteps. ‘I see TNT postmen taking short cuts. I see them lost. I have them asking me directions and the whereabouts of certain streets. ‘All this astounds me and even saddens me as I have always taken pride in my own standards of service. ‘Worse still, there is the notion held by many of my customers that the decrease in service and standards is down to me.’ A TNT Post spokesman said: ‘We of course apologise for the disruption and distress caused by non-delivery of a letter by TNT Post. ‘However, sometimes human nature means that we cannot always live up to the standards we set ourselves and where there are issues with service quality, we will take the necessary action to resolve the issues to the satisfaction of our clients.’ Royal Mail lost its monopoly on all postal deliveries in January 2006. It quickly lost key business customers and now half of post is sorted by rival companies – before being delivered by Royal Mail on the so-called ‘final mile’. But that doorstep job is now also being done by TNT Post, meaning households can have two deliveries a day. TNT Post picks up letters from its client companies and sorts them before delivering them to their final destination. The company does not have its own post boxes. Royal Mail still has 115,500, which are most often used for social mail."

We have what we have so we’ll try to take a couple of loans.’ Meanwhile, Redknapp has backed Arsenal to qualify for next season’s Champions League, but only because their competitors have not been up to scratch. Charlie Austin has netted 11 Premier League goals and his fitness is key to the Hoops' chances of survival Rangers travel to the Emirates Stadium  looking for a second successive victory. And despite Arsenal’s difficulties this season, Redknapp says they will secure a top-four spot. ‘I think the other sides have not performed to their normal level,’ said the Rangers boss. ‘Tottenham are starting to pick up some points but Everton and Liverpool, who were bang there last year, this year they are not and they need to start getting it together quickly. ‘And I’m not writing West Ham off either, but I still think Arsenal and Manchester United will fill the other two spots.’"

Rommel killed himself with cyanide on October 14 1944 after he was implicated in the failed plot of July that year to kill his master Hitler with a bomb at his HQ in East Prussia. Thousands died in the whirlwind of revenge unleashed by the Nazi state after the botched assassination. Rommel, the most high-profile warrior of his country, exalted by the newsreels and adored by the people, was promised that his family would be spared revenge if he took his own life. He was given a full state funeral in Berlin with the regime claiming he was killed by a heart attack following an Allied strafing of his car. Now the man who falsified his death certificate, Dr Friedrich Breiderhoff, has spoken from beyond the grave of the cynical charade he was forced into to cover up his death. A seven-page report he made to Cologne police on July 22 1960 has now been found in the city’s archive in which he details how he was threatened with pain of death by an S.S. man to lie on Rommel’s death certificate. Dr Breiderhoff was brought from his post at the reserve military hospital at Ulm where he was the chief physician. He was told to inspect a person in a car outside by two senior army officers. He told police: 'It was Herr Rommel.  His hat and his marshall’s baton were lying to the right of his upper body on the floor. 'Then a man in civilian dress appeared and ordered me to begin resuscitation attempts and told me that I must not tell the staff that he was dead. Served the regime: Field Marshal Rommel made his name fighting the British with the Afrika Korps (pictured) 'I made a direct cardiac injection and then attempts at resuscitation with heart massage and breathing exercises, as if the Field Marshall had drowned. 'I felt completely that Rommel was a dead man already. Then an S.S. man ordered me to remove the vomit from his mouth and I found an empty cyanide capsule in his throat covered with brown and yellow mucus. 'I was then ordered that I had to put ‘heart attack’ on the death certificate on the express orders of the High Command of the Armed Forces. Denial: Hitler held a state funeral for Rommel in Berlin, branding him The Fuhrer's General 'An S.S. man told me to maintain confidentiality otherwise I must expect revenge against my family and ""other consequences."" 'He pointed to a gun laying on a table as if to emphasise the point.' The certificate was filled in with the wording: 'Death as a result of a heart attack suffered while in service of the Reich in the west.'

I had arrived home after picking up my 3-year-old daughter from school when I heard my phone ringing. I missed the first call from my father-in-law. He called right back. I knew what he was calling about. I took the phone to my wife, Sara, and let her take the call. About 10 seconds into the conversation, she crumbled into a heap on the floor. Fighting cancer with mustaches The test results were back. My father-in-law had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. We had feared this was going to come. He had shown some worrisome symptoms for a while, but nothing really prepares you for that moment. We cried, and I supported my wife the best I could. We talked about how we could help, being that we live in Atlanta and my in-laws live just outside Chicago. Would we move? Would we take time off from work? Would we pay for a nurse to help him recover? What will his treatment be? How will it affect him? Will it make him better? A few hours after being introduced to my father-in-law almost six years ago, I joined his family in riding in Chicago Critical Mass. Several thousand fellow cyclists had taken to rush hour in downtown Chicago to demonstrate that ""we are traffic, too."" The cops shut the event down after a while. There I was, looking at the man who I knew would be my father-in-law, lifting his bicycle above his head, shouting ""F*** the police!"" I loved him instantly. The one thing I do know about his diagnosis: We will approach it with the same bluntness, energy and ""stick-it-to-the-man"" mentality that he has taken to every other challenge he's had. He is due to have surgery soon, and the prognosis looks hopeful. I know this attitude will stand him in good stead for a full recovery. When we got that fateful phone call, I realized that we were only a couple of days away from Movember, the month when ""Mo-Bros"" everywhere join forces to grow ridiculous-looking mustaches in the name of raising awareness and funds for men's health issues, specifically prostate and testicular cancer initiatives. It was a concept that seemed to fit perfectly. So I rummaged around the bathroom drawer for my long-lost razor. The last time I was completely bereft of facial hair was the night my daughter was born nearly four years ago. We were living in Amsterdam at the time, and after 24 hours or so at the hospital, we were the proud parents of a 6-pound baby girl. As my wife and our new bundle of joy slept, I rushed home to collect clothes for Sara and other sundries that had been forgotten in the rush to the hospital. I thought I would do the decent thing and clean myself up a bit before returning to the hospital in the morning. A shower and a shave, I thought. But I was so tired at that point that I didn't realize I had left the guard off my electric razor. Beard ... gone. I didn't recognize the person underneath. I've had facial hair ever since, and it really felt strange to shave it off again for Movember. It made me think about that night at the hospital and reminded me of the new sense of responsibility I felt to my daughter and wife. This time, that sense of responsibility comes from a different place. This time I feel an obligation to stand with my father-in-law, to support and honor him in the best and only way I know how. When people stop me at work and ask me why I shaved my beard off, I have a great excuse to talk about him and the type of man he is. It never fails to give me a spring in my step and a great sense of confidence, purpose and camaraderie. Ultimately, I think that's what Movember is all about."

They stopped Prince Andrew less than 48 hours after a break-in at the historic house and asked him to 'verify his identity'. It is the second time the Duke has had a run-in with police under similar circumstances. He has also been denied entry to Sandringham after he failed to show his official pass, which all royals are expected to carry with them. A source told the Evening Standard that the officers were 'doing what they are supposed to do', particularly so soon after a break-in. Former royal protection officer Ken Wharfe told the paper: 'I think this was a straightforward challenge at a time when there were probably extra patrols deployed. I do not think that guns would have been drawn. 'I could see Prince Charles having a joke about it, but Prince Andrew may have lost his rag a bit.' Prince Andrew reacted with fury at the two gun-wielding officers who confronted him as he walked in broad daylight through the grounds, sources revealed last night. The fifth-in-line to the throne stood his ground asking the officers 'Don't you know who I am?' and was said to have ‘made his thoughts plain’ during the highly-charged confrontation that followed. A royal source said: ‘He was incredibly, incredibly angry. It was very much a case of guns being pointed at him and “halt who goes there”.’ Yesterday police issued a humiliating apology to the Duke of York over the extraordinary error. According to the Daily Mirror, a source said that the Duke was red faced as he shouted at officers like a school teacher. Scroll down for video Incident: Prince Andrew had gone for a walk around the gardens in Buckingham Palace when the two officers stopped him They said: 'It got pretty heated because he just kept repeating himself ""Don't you know who I am?"". 'He felt the officers had sneaked up on him and believed they had behaved disrespectfully towards him.' They added that when the penny dropped they apologised to Prince Andrew. But this was not enough. The source added: 'He gave them a proper dressing down, shouting at them like a schoolteacher before he walked back to the main house - completely livid.' It was the second police fiasco within three days at what should be one of the most secure estates in Britain. Just 48 hours earlier officers discovered a mentally ill man attempting to smash down a door with a fire extinguisher after he scaled a 12ft wall and broke in. Yesterday Scotland Yard revealed senior officers had personally apologised to Prince Andrew in a bid to draw a line under the latest matter. In an unprecedented statement, a spokesman said: ‘We are grateful to the Duke for his understanding and have apologised for any inconvenience caused.’ Scotland Yard declined to comment on reports that the officers shouted at the 53-year-old royal, telling him to ‘put your hands up’ and ‘get on the ground’. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh attend church yesterday. They were accompanied by Prince Charles The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were in Aberdeenshire for the Braemar Gathering where they attended a church service yesterday morning A source said it would not be ‘uncommon’ for police to shout when challenging someone, but added that they did not know if he was ordered to lie down. In return, Prince Andrew issued a conciliatory statement, saying: ‘The police have a difficult job to do balancing security for the royal family and deterring intruders, and sometimes they get it wrong.’ But hinting at his anger over the confrontation, he added: ‘I am grateful for their apology and look forward to a safe walk in the garden in the future.’ Break in: Victor Miller was arrested inside the palace Royal sources said Andrew had been ‘infuriated’ by the fiasco. They continued to insist that weapons had been drawn by police, who were in a state of high tension following the previous security breach. One source said: ‘[Andrew] has calmed down now but it wasn’t a pleasant experience at all, and he was furious at the time.’ Another palace aide told the Mail: ‘The police have acknowledged the incident and apologised and he is happy to move on. He knows they have a difficult job to do and is supportive of them.’ However, senior palace sources also made clear that the prince had not been willing to make a public statement until he had received a full apology from the Met. The prince had just returned from a two-week holiday in Spain with his former wife Sarah, the Duchess of York, and their daughters Beatrice, 25, and Eugenie, 23. The pair of uniformed marksmen challenged him after discovering him near a perimeter wall in a relatively isolated area of the palace garden. Royal staff are said to be incredulous that those involved failed to recognise the prince, although officially police chiefs are saying they did nothing wrong. One source said: ‘Once it was clear who Andrew was, he certainly made his thoughts plain about what had happened. 'It has been the subject of a lot of conversation, especially as Andrew is not exactly known for suffering fools gladly.’ His former protection officer Ken Wharfe describes him as rude, bossy and terse. At the time of the incident, the Met’s Royal protection unit was on high alert after Victor Miller, 37, was caught inside the ornate State Rooms on Monday night. The complex can be accessed only through an inner courtyard at the heart of the palace. The DJ and sound engineer – who claims to have worked with stars including Amy Winehouse, N-Dubz and Tinchy Stryder – is being held in a secure mental health unit after being arrested and questioned on suspicion of burglary, trespass and criminal damage. A suspected accomplice, a man aged 38, was found outside the palace and arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary. No royals were present when the break-in took place but experts are incredulous that Miller got so far before being stopped. The two incidents highlight the tension between police and the royal family over security. The Queen – who is currently staying at Balmoral Castle with Prince Philip – has made it clear she wants the palace to be accessible to the public as possible. Former Scotland Yard Commissioner Lord Blair played down the Prince Andrew confrontation as he said it was impossible to make any site completely secure. ‘They will have to look at this,’ he added. ‘The story of the burglar is a much more difficult story than the Andrew story.’ Last night, former royal protection chief Dai Davies said of the Prince Andrew incident: ‘[The officers] were alert and that was good, but saying that, they should know who His Royal Highness is. ‘It is a very big garden and we don’t know where he was and who he told, but you would expect officers to be aware if he had gone out. 'Why wasn’t anybody aware that he was having a walk about? ‘They are right to challenge anybody they don’t know, quite obviously if they don’t and something happens … they are criticised.’ A Metropolitan Police spokesman declined to comment on whether the officers would face any disciplinary action or ‘words of advice’. He said: ‘Uniformed officers approached a man in the gardens of Buckingham Palace to verify his identity. The man was satisfactorily identified. ‘No weapons were drawn and no force  was used. 'We can confirm that the man spoken to by officers was the Duke of York. We are making this public with His Royal Highness’s permission. The Queen, pictured yesterday with Prince Charles watch competitors at the Highland Games in Braemar, Scotland, was told of the incident"

CIA Director Leon Panetta canceled the covert program this year when he learned of its full scope. The existence of the program, which began in 2001, came to light earlier this year when CIA Director Leon Panetta canceled the effort, but it is only now that Blackwater's involvement has become known. That development was first reported Thursday in The New York Times. The program was part of a broader effort inside the CIA to develop the capacity to conduct training, surveillance and possible covert operations overseas, according to the source. The program was outsourced to contractors to ""put some distance"" between the effort and the U.S. government. By mid-2006, Blackwater's involvement in the program had ended, according to a U.S. official. Other contractors were brought in for other parts of the program, another source said. The total program cost ""millions,"" a U.S. official said. It is not known how much Blackwater was paid. The company -- now known as Xe -- did not return CNN's calls seeking comment. ""The program ebbed and flowed. There were different phases to it. There may have been different folks involved,"" the source said. U.S. officials have previously acknowledged that Panetta canceled the entire program this year when he learned of its full scope. At the time of the cancellation, officials said, renewal of the program was being considered. At that point, it had been brought to the new CIA director's attention. Panetta canceled the effort in part because Congress had not been notified about it, officials said. Also, some in the intelligence community were worried there could be a diplomatic disaster if contractors were caught performing such work in foreign countries. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who ran the agency from 2006 to 2009, downplayed the program during a speaking engagement in Washington. ""This was not a very prominent thing during my time as director,"" Hayden said. ""What you had were three separate efforts under three different directors to deal with an issue that everyone understood was a problem in a capacity that everyone agreed we should have."" A spokesman for the CIA would not comment on the details of the still-classified program. ""Director Panetta thought this effort should be briefed to Congress, and he did so,"" spokesman George Little said. ""He also knew it hadn't been successful, so he ended it. Neither decision was difficult. This was clear and straightforward. ""Director Panetta did not tell the committees that the agency had misled the Congress or had broken the law. He decided that the time had come to brief Congress on a counterterrorism effort."" Blackwater's extensive involvement in U.S. operations overseas, particularly in Iraq, has been controversial. The Iraqi government says that in a shooting in September 2007, Blackwater security guards killed 17 Iraqi civilians. Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. The incident led to the Iraqi government's refusal to renew the firm's operating license in the country when it expired in May. Although it lost the Iraq contract, the company, which changed its name to Xe earlier this year, continued to get multimillion-dollar contracts from the U.S. government for work in Afghanistan."

On April 8, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg let the company's board of directors know he was about to spend $1 billion on hot photo start-up Instagram -- just hours before the deal was done, according to the Wall Street Journal. The deal was nailed down, unnamed sources told the Journal, in only three days. Meetings between Zuckerberg, 27, and Instagram head Kevin Systrom, 28, that took place at Zuckerberg's multi-million-dollar Palo Alto, California, home. It's a move that shows Zuckerberg displaying the hacker spirit that helped him launch a social-media juggernaut in his college dorm room. And that's a spirit that doesn't always jibe with the image of  CEO of a corporation expected to be valued at up to $100 billion when it makes its first public stock offering in the next few weeks. ""On balance, I'm not sure it's the best way to do business,"" said Ali Velshi, CNN's chief business correspondent. ""But Mark Zuckerberg has defied all rules."" The moxie suggested in the report comes at an interesting time for Facebook and Zuckerberg, who also reportedly whittled down Systrom's initial asking price of $2 billion. On the brink of offering up Facebook, with its hundreds of millions of users, to stockholders, even Zuckerberg's controlling interest in the company (a 57% share of voting rights, according to reports) could soon need to be checked by the types of lawyers, bean-counters and other business types whose jobs involve looking out for a company's bottom line. ""This paints a complex picture of its CEO as at once confident and bold, and also nervous and panicky -- details that will be scrutinized come Facebook's imminent IPO,"" Kit Eaton wrote on Fast Company's website. Velshi, who over the course of his career covered the ""tech bubble"" of the late 1990s, said the whirlwind purchase may, in fact, be a last hurrah of sorts for Zuckerberg. ""It actually happens more than we think. And it's not a bad thing, particularly in non-public companies, Velshi said. ""But, in public companies, boards are important -- they are supposed to protect shareholder interests, and they are supposed to bring perspective and experience that a kid CEO may not have."" The Facebook board did vote to approve the deal, according to the Journal. But at that point, it was largely an endorsement more than a decision. The board, one source said, ""was told, not consulted."" In the fast-moving world of Web tech, being nimble is almost a prerequisite for survival. Fail to adapt and someone else will pass you by. Instagram, a mobile app which lets users enhance their photos with a raft of pre-created filters, was reportedly on the verge of nailing down a new round of private investments worth $50 million. Could that have made Zuckerberg overpay for a company with 13 employees and no revenue to date? Maybe, says Velshi. ""Creativity, innovation and deal-making are different strengths; rarely does one person possess all of them,"" he said. ""That Zuckerberg felt strongly that he wanted Instragram may not have made him the best person to do the deal -- that's why we have real estate agents, or talent agents."" For what it's worth, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was aware of the negotiations all along, although she didn't personally take part. And, for Facebook, making a profit directly from Instagram may have been less important than locking up its user data and taking a rapidly growing competitor, now with more than 40 million users, off of the playing field. Regardless of where the future takes Facebook -- whether life as a publicly traded commodity is more about stuffy board meetings than spur-of-the moment handshake deals -- Wednesday's report provided at least one more glimpse at the hoodie-wearing, authority-flouting CEO whose origin story has literally become the stuff of Hollywood storytelling. ""What's cooler than a billion dollars?"" Matthew Braga of Ars Technica wrote, invoking the oft-paraphrased line from Facebook biopic ""The Social Network."" ""A billion dollars without board approval."""

Brygida Schefler, 28, told police her ex-husband, Maciej Nowicki, hid tracking devices in her SUV and frequently spied on her outside her home in Volusia County, Florida following their violent fight in July. After Maciej accused Schefler of cheating on him that month, prompting Schefler to allegedly plunge a kitchen knife into his left arm, she filed an injunction for protection against him. Still got the spark: Brygida Schefler, 28, has accused her ex-husband Maciej Nowicki, 73, of stalking her months after filing an injunction against him following a fight that left him with a 6-inch knife in his arm On Thursday Schefler accused him of violating that injection for domestic violence as well as bragging about the tracking devices installed, according to a police affidavit obtained by the Daytona Beach News-Journal. While visiting a friend on Thursday Schefler told police she saw Nowicki parked across the street watching her, leading to his arrest. Stalker: Scheffler, pictured, told police she has found tracking devices in her SUV and has also seen Nowicki, her senior by 45 years, watching her from his car Schefller told police she doesn't want her ex-husband arrested, just for him to leave her alone. Nowicki, who denied intentionally following Schefler to deputies, is being held without set bail in Volusia County. An obviously passionate couple in their own ways, after Nowicki accused his then-wife in July of having an affair over the last year Scheffler allegedly attacked him with a 6-inch knife, plunging it into the septuagenarian’s left forearm. Scheffler was arrested and charged with aggravated battery on a person older than 65. Nowicki had raised his arm to protect himself when he suffered the blow, the police report states. Investigators said the 72-year-old had grabbed a gold club to defend himself, reported The Daytona Beach News Journal. Scheffler, a waitress who is originally from Poland, then threatened Nowicki that if he called police it would be the last thing he’d do as her friends would come ‘do him in’, officials said. Nowicki ignored the threats and called 911. Responding deputies found Nowicki with large amounts of blood pouring from his arm. There was blood and a small amount of flesh on the knife, said investigators. Scheffler told the News Journal that  all the charges against her were false. 'Everything that the man said and all the charges they put on me are false,' she said."

Chartered surveyor Peter Westropp was killed by a falling lump of masonry as he sat drinking with friends outside a restaurant in Battersea, southwest London. The 27-year-old and his friends had just moved table when blocks of stone crashed down outside Le Bouchon Bordelais, with one hitting him on the head and knocking him unconscious. But as Mr Westropp lay dying under the fallen debris, just four days before his 28th birthday, one selfish man carried on ordering drinks just metres from the commotion. Tragic: Chartered surveyor Peter Westropp, 27, was killed when falling masonry shattered his skull as he shared a drink with friends Ms Kripena said: 'A customer asked me what happened and I said the masonry has collapsed and someone was seriously hurt or dead. 'Another guy who was with him wanted to order another glass of wine. I screamed at him ""Are you mad? Can’t you see what has happened? We are closed"".' The dedicated Arsenal fan died soon afterwards having suffered devastating head injuries. The waitress went to a back room in the bar to get a tablecloth to place over Mr Westropp’s body. The inquest was also told by the bistro's manager said that around three months before the death, a driver lost control of her car and crashed into the building. Mr Naick M’Bae, the restaurant's duty manager on the night Mr Westropp died, said: 'I can remember one significant incident leading up to this incident, where damage was caused to the front of the building. 'Approximately three months before this incident a car driven by a woman lost control and ran into the restaurant hitting the wall between units five and seven. 'This caused damage to the patio window and the partition wall between units seven and nine.' The manager said he had also spotted youths jumping on the restaurant’s boundary wall just four days before Mr Westropp’s death He said: 'The only other incident I can recall was a number of youths jumped between the boundary terrace wall. Heartbroken: Peter Westropp's parents John Westropp, left, and Marion Westropp, right, from Shortlands, Bromley, arriving at the inquest into their son's death in August last year 'They were climbing onto the wall and jumpng on the side of the terrace. 'The canopy was up and they were jumping on the wall and jumping down. It was high jinx.' Several shops and businesses have been damaged in the days before Peter’s death as widespread rioting swept through the capital in August last year. Le Bouchon closed on Monday and Tuesday evening due to the riots, but had reopened on the Wednesday, the night Peter died. Both Mr M’Bae and Ms Kripena told the inquest they were unaware of any damage to the bar during the riots. His father John Westropp told Westminster Coroner’s Court that friends and family are still coming to terms with the tragedy. He said: 'Peter has left a gaping hole in our lives and is sadly missed by so many. ‘What has shone through all this is that throughout his tragically short life, Peter made countless friends. ‘He loved socialising, sometimes a bit too much, and I think he influenced many people’s lives for the better. ‘We know from talking to his age group that they were all severely shocked by his death.' Mr Westropp had recently moved to Battersea from his family home in Bromley, Kent. He was with friends at the bar in Battersea Rise when the incident happened, at around 9.15pm, on August 10 last year. They finished dinner across the road and headed to Le Bouchon where Peter Westropp bought the first pitcher of beer. The scene: Westropp was sitting outside French restaurant and bar, Le Bouchon Bordelais, on Battersea Rise in Battersea, south London, when he was hit by a stone slab Friend Harry Pope said: ‘We had been sat there for about 15 minutes when we heard a noise. ‘There was no warning, it was very sudden. ‘It was falling masonry from the building and it hit Peter on the head. ‘When it happened, there was obviously quite a commotion inside the bar and around the tables, with everyone trying to see what had happened. ‘Peter clearly wasn’t OK, and at that point I was overcome by emotion.’ Mr Westropp was immediately knocked unconscious and had a large wound on his head. Police were called to the scene amid fears that the incident might have been riot related. PC Steven Hayles said told the court: ‘I was told friends had been sitting with Peter at a table when suddenly a block of masonry came down and hit him, and he was knocked unconscious immediately. ‘It had come from above the restaurant sign, by a window of the flats.’ Following his death, around 650 packed out a church for his funeral, and friends and family have continued to pay tribute to his life in the year since. John Westropp told the hearing: ‘He was an ardent Arsenal fan, attended as many games home and away as possible. ‘Thanks to friends, he will be remembered by a plaque in the new memorial floor at the stadium.’ A memorial trust has been set up in his honour since his death, with the inaugural fund raising dinner held last month raising £18,000 for charity. ‘The trust will raise funds for the Carers Trust, which Peter would have needed no doubt is he survived the tragic accident’, said Mr Westropp. Peter was born in Islington, but his family moved to Bromley two years later. He graduated from Leeds University with a BA in Geography in 2002 before gaining a masters in real estate management from Oxford Brookes University. He had worked at leading London property consultancy firm Gerald Eve since 2007, and was dating a Irish woman called Ellie at the time. His father said he loved going on ski trips with friends and had travelled the world in a gap year, visiting every continent except for Antarctica. Peter had been living with his parents in Shortlands, Bromley, before moving to Battersea. The inquest into the cause of his death, which is due to last five days, continues."

Federal safety investigators have all but eliminated mechanical problems as the cause of the December 1 derailment but added one more clue suggesting the engineer might not have been as attentive as he should have been. At 7:11 a.m. that Sunday -- about 11 minutes before the derailment -- the engineer did not dim the train's headlights as required when it passed another train, the National Transportation Safety Board said Monday. Engineer William Rockefeller Jr. acknowledged to investigators having a lapse in attention as the train approached a sharp curve, according Rockefeller's lawyer, Jeffrey Chartier, and his union representative.  The train's motion might have caused him to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed ""highway hypnosis."" Four people died and dozens were injured when the train, traveling at about 82 miles per hour, derailed on the curve, which has a 30 mph limit. The NTSB said Monday it believes that positive train control, a high-tech system that targets human error, could have prevented the crash.  The safety board has pushed the system for about 20 years.  Congress is requiring most major railroads, including Metro-North, to install the costly systems by the end of 2015. Railroad announces safety upgrades The NTSB said it has completed its inspection of the train and found no anomalies. The ""dead-man"" switch -- a foot pedal that must be depressed to keep the train moving -- was also working, the board said.  Nor did it find problems with speed sensors, the brake control unit or the train's propulsion controller. The board reiterated that it found no problems with the tracks or the signal system. Finally, the board said it conducted a ""site/distance"" test and found no problems with visibility. ""As a result, at this time, the NTSB believes that if positive train control technology was installed on this line and train, it would have required the engineer to slow the train to an appropriate speed or stop the train in the event the engineer did not do so, likely preventing the derailment,"" the board said in a statement. Investigators are still awaiting results of crew drug tests and cellphone records, the board said, and it is continuing interviews with passengers, Metro-North employees who were riding on the train and first responders.

Part-time real estate agent Jaime Castano, 20, allegedly burned the 19-year-old's mattress in his dorm room last August while singing to her, recording the incident on a cell phone and posting it on Snapchat. At his arraignment last week, the student's attorney Alyssa Gamliel suggested the victim had blacked out during a booze binge and may have been complicit, according to the New York Daily News. Allegations: Jaime Castano, 20, has been accused of setting fire to the to the 19-year-old's (not pictured) mattress in NYU accomodation last August while singing her, recording the incident and posting it on Snapchat 'I do not think she knows what happened or her participation in this, nor do I think the People will be able to prove that she was not sort of participating in some of this activity,' she told a judge at Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday. The teenager suffered 'painful burns and scarring to her torso', it was alleged in a criminal complaint. However Gamliel argues that the injuries became infected because she failed to treat them and could have been a result of her 'continued behavior of intoxication'. The victim claims she and a third person were with Castano at his dorm room on Lafayette Street when she fell asleep at about 11pm on August 23. Case: If convicted of first-degree assault, Castano could be jailed for up to 25 years At around 6am the following the morning she woke to find holes and burn marks on her bed and blankets, burns on her clothes, and painful burns on her body, prosecutors told the broadcaster. But she wasn't aware of what caused the fire until she saw Castano's video, which he had shared with the photo-messaging application, it is claimed The victim reported the attack to university officials but they did not alert police until October 27 - more than two months after it allegedly occurred. If convicted of first-degree assault, Castano could be jailed for up to 25 years. He was expelled by NYU in September after an internal investigation, although his attorney told the judge Monday that he left the private university voluntarily.

The poster, which caused alarm because it seems to go against medical advice that the virus cannot be transmitted by air, said Ebola could be contracted if someone came into contact with objects that had been sneezed on by people who were infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) poster said droplets, such as those from a sneeze, carried the virus and could remain infectious on surfaces for up to several hours. The CDC image which shows their warning that droplets from a sneeze could transmit Ebola Debate about government-imposed quarantines for people exposed to the virus has grown over the past few weeks, as isolated cases  are diagnosed in the U.S. and it continues to spread across West Africa. So far, more than 4,900 people have been killed - the vast majority in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - in the deadliest outbreak of the virus on record. The CDC poster, now removed, stated: 'Droplet spread happens when the germs traveling inside droplets that are coughed or sneezed from a sick person enter the eyes, nose or mouth of another person,' the New York Post reported. It warned someone could become infected should they accidentally touch the sneeze droplets and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth. Today, the CDC internet page dedicated to the subject stated it was being updated. It read: 'The What’s the difference between infections spread through air or by droplets? Fact sheet is being updated and is currently unavailable. Please visit cdc.gov/Ebola for up-to-date information on Ebola.' Medical experts have repeatedly stated the Ebola virus is not transmittable by air. It is contracted when someone comes into contact with the body fluids, such as urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk and semen, of a person who is infected. An image of the Ebola virus, which has killed nearly 5,000 people in West Africa and recently reached the U.S. But experts have repeatedly warned of the frightening possibility the Ebola virus could mutate and become airborne. Although the risk of it doing so is thought to be low, experts cannot discount it entirely. Two weeks ago leading scientist Lord Robert Winston warned the risk of Ebola spreading could dramatically increase if it becomes airborne. In a House of Lords debate, the fertility doctor demanded answers from the government about how closely they were monitoring the virus. Lord Winston said: ‘We know that viruses mutate, we know that the Ebola virus can mutate. ‘We know perfectly well that it is not airborne at the moment, and we know that the pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract cells are unlikely to harbour the virus. ‘However, can you assure us that people are looking at the risk of mutation of this virus so that we can make certain that its mode of transmission does not change?' And the chief of the UN’s Ebola mission, Anthony Banbury, also warned earlier this month that the virus could become airborne. He said aid workers were racing against time to control the epidemic in case it mutates in a ‘nightmare scenario’.

An Ohio House committee added an amendment to a state budget bill Monday that says students attending state universities in Ohio ""are not public employees based upon participating in athletics for the state university."" It's the latest reaction to the ruling last month by the National Labor Relations Board in Chicago that football players at Illinois' Northwestern University are considered employees of their school and can vote to form a union. Because Northwestern is a private school, the NLRB governs whether athletes there can vote to form a union. At public schools, that decision is governed by state law. That prompted movement from lawmakers in two states Monday. In Connecticut, legislators said they were considering drafting legislation that would allow it. The amendment added to the budget bill in Ohio would ban it. The players at Northwestern still have to vote to actually form their union. That vote takes place April 25 and some of the leaders on the team have said they plan to vote ""no."" Head coach Pat Fitzgerald told his team he doesn't think a union is in their best interest. Reaction from current and former athletes has been mixed. Other private schools, like Duke and Stanford, have had meetings on the issue, according to remarks by Northwestern's president emeritus Henry Bienen at the Knight Commission on intercollegiate athletics last month. State lawmakers in Connecticut have expressed support, praising University of Connecticut guard Shabazz Napier -- named the most valuable player in the team's win Monday over the University of Kentucky for the NCAA basketball championship -- for talking out about NCAA reform. The Ohio measure will probably go to a vote in the state House on Wednesday, a staffer said. If it passes there, it still must be approved by the state Senate. Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association and a driving force behind the union idea, has said that the NLRB ruling would have a domino effect, but he wouldn't comment on whether athletes at other schools are considering a hard push to form a union. Northwestern is appealing the NLRB's decision, and the appeals process could take years, making its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.

People wait the longest in Western Europe, where the average age is over 30. In Afghanistan, one of the youngest, they tend to do it at 20. And while getting married remains the most common lifestyle choice worldwide, every single country is seeing people bite the bullet later than ever. Waiting for it: This map shows the average age people the world over tend to marry and that age is trending upward everywhere The numbers come from 2012 United Nations data, which the site Priceonomics used to assemble the map. Across the globe, the biggest factor in the age countries tend to marry is economic. The richer the nation, the longer people wait. Which explains how common it is for Western Europeans and Scandinavians to wait until after 30. And why in Afghanistan, where living standards are among the world’s lowest, people marry a decade younger. Gender differences: While everyone is getting married at an older age, men in every country surveyed by the United Nations in 2012 marry at an older average age than their female counterparts A Pew Research Center 2011 study put the average age for American women to marry at 26.9. The age for men was 29.8. While the difference between men and women seems minimal, averaging masks a the fact that men tend to marry much older than men worldwide. According to Priceonomics, women continue to marry much older men in developing countries. In 39 of the studied countries, 20 percent of women marry by the age of 18. And in twenty countries, 10 percent of females are married by the age of 15. Men, on the other hand, are married by 18 in only 2 percent of countries surveyed. Income gap: Young Palestinian groom Ahmed Soboh, 15 and his bride Tala, 14. Income is the largest factor that determines the age at which a nation's citizens tend to marry. The richer the country, the older the average age In addition to the age when people married rising worldwide, fewer people are now married—at least in the United States—than ever before. Less than half of adults in America are married compared to 72 percent who were married in 1960. However, that doesn’t mean the unwed intend to stay that way. According to the study, marriage is the preferred lifestyle worldwide. In most of the surveyed countries, 80 percent of both men and women were married before age 50."

The rest of England and Wales will also enjoy the warm spell with temperatures hovering in the mid teens, although forecasters say it will stay cloudy. The Met Office described how rain carrying dust from the Sahara stains cars when it falls. 'Where there has been rain in the southeast there has been red dust brought down with it. When the rain dries off it leaves a red residue,' a spokeswoman said. 'This could last until the early part of the week.' Temperatures are then likely to plummet to around 8C in the Midlands and 6C in Scotland.

Bolving is the deep-throated unique to red deer stags during the rutting season. The call is designed to frighten off other stags leaving the hinds - females - to the individual stag for mating. Contestants in the World Bolving championships have to roar - or bolve - across a large valley in the hope of getting a stag to bolve back, which scores points with the judges. Over one hundred and fifty nature lovers gathered at Draydon Rails to see the ninth annual contest in aid of the Devon Air Ambulance Trust. Previous winner, Richard Eales, who now organises the event, said the contest started life as a bet among locals in the Rock Inn pub over who could get a stag to call back. Last year's winner Elvis Afanasenko, who lives on the moor, retained his world champion title at the weekend. Bolving was traditionally used across Europe to hunt deer who were a problem to farmers, but difficult to locate. A good call attracted the stags and made them easier to find.

Those units are planned for East 27th Street in Manhattan - with 40 per cent of homes available to low and middle-income New Yorkers. The first residents are expected to move in September 2015. The project, which was viewed by Mayor Bloomberg in January, will be the first apartment building in New York where units are constructed off-site and then fitted together. The design team behind the project aimed to capitalize on the sense of 'openness' in the tiny units. The new homes are all between 250 to 370 square feet and have ceiling heights of around 9ft. Each unit has an open-plan living space with kitchen, a separate bathroom, balcony and long storage area packed in close to the ceiling. Just like Lego: An artist's impression shows how the prefabricated units, which will be made in Brooklyn Navy Yard, will be fitted together at the site Who lives in a house like this?

The new homes will be at 335 East 27th Street in mid-town Manhattan close to the East River.  The building will have rehearsal spaces on the ground floor, lecture halls and a cafe. An attic garden and ground-level picnic area have also been planned along with a laundry room, bike room and gym. Mayor Bloomberg said of the units: 'New York’s ability to adapt with changing times is what made us the world’s greatest city – and it’s going to be what keeps us strong in the 21st Century. 'The growth rate for one- and two-person households greatly exceeds that of households with three or more people, and addressing that housing challenge requires us to think creatively and beyond our current regulations.' The current housing codes do not allow for an entire building of micro-apartments in NYC - despite the number of one and two-person households accelerating at the fastest rate. Neat design: Mayor Bloomberg surveys the living space of the new apartment design which will be part of a new exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York On board: Bloomberg tries the foldaway bed at the apartment which he backed as part of New York's way of adapting for the future Inspired: The collaborative design is fitted together from different components to make it easier to live in a compact space City of the future: The building is in mid-town Manhattan close to the East River Communal living: The apartment complex will also have an attic garden, gym and ground-floor rehearsal spaces and picnic tables At present 1.8 million people in New York live alone or with one another - yet there are only one million studios and one-bed apartments in the five boroughs.

The bizarre plan is being considered by the Honours Forfeiture Committee because knighthoods cannot be removed from people who have died. Those given a knighthood are awarded lifetime membership to a ‘living order’ and the title no longer exists when the holder dies. A constitutional bar preventing the dead from having their knighthoods removed means the government's forfeiture committee cannot strip Savile of the accolade A Whitehall source told The Sunday Times: 'The forfeiture committee is certainly looking at the issue.' The TV host, who died last year aged 84, was knighted in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list in 1990 - an award which followed the OBE he was given for services to charity and broadcasting in 1971. The Queen has the power to remove honours after they have been recommended by the forfeiture committee. Last year Fred Goodwin, former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, was stripped of his knighthood. Paedophile: Jimmy Saville who was awarded a knighthood in 1990 for 'charitable services' A report published this week by Scotland Yard and NSPCC said he DJ spent ‘every waking minute’ thinking about abusing children and used his celebrity status to that end.

Allegations of sexual assault have been made by 450 individuals, aged up to 47, and some have yet to be interviewed. The 214 confirmed offences included 34 rapes and stretch across 28 police force areas. The most recent was in 2009 but they date back as far as 1955. Lawyers for the victims have already instigated compensation claims against the BBC, NHS and education authorities for failing to stop the serial predator. The payouts could run into millions of pounds. Victims said it was shocking it had taken so long to expose the DJ’s predatory behaviour. They said senior managers who missed opportunities to stop him should be named and shamed."

Tropical storm conditions are possible within 24 hours under a tropical storm watch. Ida made landfall as a hurricane Thursday morning over east central Nicaragua, pelting the Central American nation with heavy rain before weakening to a tropical storm. At 7 p.m. ET, Ida was heading north-northwest at about 10 mph (17 kph) and was about 180 miles (290 km) east-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico, the hurricane center said. Track Ida's projected path Forecasters expect the storm, with winds of 70 mph (110 kph), to reach hurricane status by Saturday night or early Sunday. If the storm becomes a hurricane again, however, it could lose power and downgrade back to a tropical storm in the coming days. As Ida crosses the Yucatan Channel, the Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba could get 3 to 5 inches of rain; some areas could see as many as 10 inches, the center said. The Gulf Coast could experience heavy rain and coastal flooding next week as Ida approaches the area. Ida is the Atlantic region's ninth named storm. The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30.

He was dubbed the 'paparazzo extraordinaire' by Newsweek - a name that has become the title of his new book, released this month. Whether it was snapping Michael Jackson and Brooke Shields at the Shrine Auditorium in 1984, Jackie O without her sunglasses on, or Brigitte Bardot in a bikini in St-Tropez, the now 81-year-old was the pioneer of high-stakes, stake-out paparazzi photography, which ultimately lead to the former First Lady filing a restraining order against him. King of Paparazzi: Following Jackie O (right) around New York's Upper East Side for years, Ron Galella (inset) was eventually ordered to stay 50 yards away from her, but still captured some of her most iconic images Following Onassis around New York's Upper East Side for years, he jumped out of bushes as she cycled in Central Park, hovered around her tennis matches and even followed her to Greece, where he dressed up as a Greek sailor in order to snap pictures of her in a bikini. She eventually pressed charges against him, and he was forced to stay 100 yards from her home and 50 yards away from her and her children. Mr Galella snapped his now iconic photographs using his ability to outsmart stars, capturing them at the perfect moment by popping out of a bush, jumping from around a corner, or hanging out the window of a taxi. Ron Galella's iconic images: The photographer snapped Michael Jackson and Brooke Shields at the Shrine Auditorium in 1984, one of the many images in the new book Photo Extraordinaire Stealth and precision: Mr Galella snapped his now iconic photographs by outsmarting stars, by popping out of a bush, jumping from around a corner, or hanging out the window of a taxi Biggest fan: Andy Warhol famously called Ron Galella his favourite photographer, after the artist explained, 'My idea of a good picture is one that's in focus and of a famous person doing something unfamous' When he photographed Greta Garbo in 1978 leaving New York's Rizzoli bookstore, the photographer hid in a phone booth down the block. He then jumped out to take her picture, according to The Daily Beast.

Paparazzo Extraordinaire: The book includes his famous Windblown Jackie The book also includes an accompanying essay arguing that his often provocative method mixed with his innate eye resulted in aesthetically superior images to the paparazzi shots flooding today's media. Although the photographer has since retired from the paparazzi game, he will be attending the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute Gala on May 7 to take pictures of the fashion world's elite. He will be next to a mosh-pit of other screaming paparazzi, but said he will reignite his famous focus and stealth, with his eyes set on Taylor Swift: 'I hope she shows up, he said. Paparazzo Extraordinaire, published by German publisher Hatje Cantz, features images of Frank Sinatra, Micheal Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor, Brigette Bardot, Mick Jagger, John Lennon, John Travolta and Andy Warhol.

Police encountered an unthinkably gruesome scene at the home of Robert and Tammy Rafferty in February 2011. Despicable: Christopher Wells, once a 'dashing' Chippendale dancer, will spend his life in prison for having his wife and brother-in-law killed At the end of a trail of human teeth lay the body of Robert Rafferty, an ordained minister, in a pool of his own blood. He’d suffered a gunshot wound, stab wounds in the neck, and showed evidence he’d been beaten. The body of Amara Wells,39, lay nearby, too bloody for police to see the gunshot wound, but with the deep gash in her neck visible. The intruder had also tried to set fire to the Castle Rock, Colorado home. Amara Wells was the Rafferty’s sister-in-law, her husband Christopher Wells was Tammy’s brother. After years of escalating drug use, violent threats, and a restraining order barring Christopher Wells from having contact with his wife and daughter, Amara Wells took her daughter and moved into the Rafferty home out of fear her husband would harm her and her daughter. But on February 23, 2011, Wells was harmed anyway. A man dressed as a ninja entered the Rafferty home and brutally slayed Robert Rafferty,49, and Amara Wells, all while Wells’ 6-year-old daughter Alex watched, horrified. The investigation and later accounts would paint Rafferty as a hero who fought to his death to protect the 6-year-old and her mother. Ghastly: In Feb. 2011, Wells' daughter awoke to find her mother and uncle being shot and stabbed to death in this home in a quiet, secluded residential Colorado community Almost safe: Amara Wells (right) and her daughter had fled from her drug-addicted, violent husband but he put a bounty on her head from jail Sgt. Jason Weaver of the Douglas County, Colorado sheriff’s department was among the first to arrive at the scene and would later testify to all its gory details, but also to an uplifting one. Alex, who’d only just seen her mother and uncle savagely slaughtered, was trying to be strong. ‘I have never seen a child go through such trauma and be so strong,’ Weaver told ABC in a March 29 episode of 20/20. ‘That little girl is absolutely nothing more than amazing.’ Prosecutors in the case said that Alex woke up and saw the attacks, then ran to a neighbor’s to call 911. Investigators logically suspected Chris Wells, who’d been arrested four times for violating the restraining order his wife held. According to the family, former Chippendales dancer Wells was once dashing, but had become heavily addicted to methamphetamine and increasingly hostile in the time leading up to his wife leaving with the girl. While Wells’ and her daughter settled into life with the Raffertys, Christopher Wells’ behavior took and an even more disturbing turn. Hero: Robert Rafferty, an ordained minister, tried valiantly to fight off the intruder who eventually murdered him and his sister-in-law Amara Wells’ sister Melissa Brown described one particularly horrifying incident the occurred after Chris Wells called to say he was dropping by to leave his wife and daughter’s belongings at the end of the Rafferty’s driveway. ‘All of the sudden I heard [Amara Wells] scream,’ Brown said. ‘She was standing there holding her wedding dress and he urinated across it and wrote a profanity.’ Though he seemed disturbed enough to have committed the heinous crime, investigators hit a roadblock when they realized Wells was in jail at the time of the double murder. Weaver and the other investigators remained convinced of Wells’ involvement, however, They visited the car dealership where Wells worked and interviewed his co-woker, 27-year-old Josiah Sher. Sher had a suspicious wound on his head and police took him in for questioning. Sher would eventually admit to the killings and implicate three others, including Wells, in the killings. Sick duo: High on cocaine and wearing a ninja outfit, Josiah Sher (left) broke in to his victims' home, shot, and stabbed Robert Rafferty and Amara Wells to death while Matthew Plake (right) waited in the getaway vehicle He told them a middle-man named Micah Woody offered Sher, on behalf of Wells, $5,000 each for the murders of his Wells' sister Tammy, his wife Amara, and brother-in-law Robert Rafferty. After using cocaine leading up to the crime, Sher told police her was driven to the home by an accomplice named Matthew Plake. After a lengthy struggle with Rafferty, Sher says he managed to shoot and kill both him and Amara Wells. Matthew Plake would later confess he’d been behind the wheel of the getaway car that night but not involved in the actual slayings. Middleman: Micah Woody (pictured) will spend the next 46 years in jail for playing go-between and helping Wells hire Sher to kill Wells' family During most of the trial of Wells, Woody, Plake, and Sher, Wells maintained his innocence. The prosecution had a powerful case without Wells’ confession, but 6-year-old Alex would be forced to take the stand and recount the heinous crimes she witnessed. The family had to decide if they wanted to put Alex on the stand and pursue the death penalty or allow Wells to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life in prison, sparing Alex. They chose to spare the girl and Wells agreed to confession on the condition he be allowed to tape a message for his daughter to watch. ‘He put together a very short, cold videotape, basically that he wouldn't be able to see her anymore,’ Amara Wells’ brother Jack Brown told ABC. ‘Oddly enough, that, you know, she should be a good girl and stay out of trouble and not to do bad things.’ Woody and Plake will spend the next 46 years behind bars for their cursory roles in the crime. Sher and Woods were convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Still dangerous? Wells will spend the rest of his life behind bars but family says he receives money from an unknown patron and will stop at nothing to finish them off But surviving family like Tammy Rafferty, who was fortunate enough to be out of town on business the night of the crime and lives on in spite of the price tag once on her head, says instead of relief she feels only fear. She says her brother regularly receives cash from an unknown associate and prison officials confirm as much but say they are in control of how Wells uses the money while in prison. ‘I know what Chris does when he has access to money,’ Rafferty said. ‘His job isn't done, I think he wants to come after me because I wasn't home that night. And I think he wants to come after Melissa and Ed because they are now the parents of my niece.’"

Ribery played a starring role in the 2006 tournament in Germany, scoring his first international goal in the second-round win over Spain as France reached the final before losing on penalties to Italy. However, 2010 provided a marked contrast as Raymond Domenech's side managed just one point and one goal in a group stage campaign that ended in mutiny against the beleaguered coach. Following a dispute between Domenech and striker Nicolas Anelka, the team refused to train and captain Patrice Evra was seen arguing with fitness coach Robert Duverne. Ribery was reported to have clash with fellow midfielder Yoann Gourcuff following France's defeat to Mexico, but made an extraordinary unscheduled appearance on TV station Telefoot to dismiss those claims, express his sorrow for France's under-performance and support Domenech's authority."

The U.S. Marshals Service sold off nearly 500 pieces of personal property belonging to Bernie and his wife Ruth Madoff in New York on Saturday morning. The money raised through the auction goes the U.S. Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund to compensate the victims of Madoff's history-making fraud. ""Another chapter (in the Madoff saga) ended here today,"" Deputy U.S. Marshal Roland Ubaldo told CNN by e-mail. ""All 489 lots of ill-gotten gains sold today and the proceeds will go toward something good for a change."" For months, Madoff successfully avoided detention after his arrest for engineering a sprawling Ponzi scheme, posting $10 million bail and cloistering himself with his wife in their $7 million Manhattan apartment. But he lost his freedom -- as well as access to his once vast wealth -- when he pleaded guilty in 2009 to 11 counts including money laundering and perjury. A judge, saying he had perpetrated ""extraordinarily evil"" crimes, later sentenced him to 150 years in prison. On Saturday, some of Madoff's riches taken from his homes in New York City and Montauk, Long Island, were on the auction block. Several items went for significantly more money than had been expected in what the U.S. Marshall's office deemed ""a very successful day."" A 10.5-carat diamond engagement ring fetched $550,000 at the auction -- appreciably more than the $350,000 auctioneers had hoped to get. A Steinway and Sons grand piano, which had been expected to get $16,000, went for $42,000, while a pair of black velveteen slippers embroidered with the initials BLM in gold thread were sold for $6,100, said Ubaldo. Last year, the first auction of Madoff's property brought in more than $900,000, with most items selling for prices well beyond the highest pre-sale estimates. The 71-year-old is now at the Butner Federal Correction Complex, a medium-security prison in North Carolina, and scheduled to be released on Nov. 14, 2139. He masqueraded his investment firm as legitimate when it was nothing more than a front. He would use the funds from new investors to send payments to his more mature investors. He would falsely portray these payments as proceeds from investments, when they were actually stolen money. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report."

The chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick also found suicides behind bars are at a 10-year high. And he suggested that the rise in problems in jails could be linked to government reforms and spending cuts, a claim disputed by the government. In his annual report, Mr Hardwick said prisoners are increasingly clambering on to the netting between wing landings in an attempt to be moved to a safer prison. So-called incidents of height - described as 'a one person riot' - nearly doubled in 2013-14 to 1,007 from 591 in the previous year. Inmates climb on to the netting or railings in the hope they will be taken to segregation units and then 'shipped out' of the prison to a safer jail, where conditions appear better or where they will be closer to home, the report added. Mr Hardwick said the mix of resource, population and Government policy pressures was a significant factor in the 'rapid deterioration' in safety and increase in violence at prisons in the period. Elsewhere, the report said the number of assaults involving adult male prisoners increased by 14 per cent on the year before and was the highest for any year for which there is data. There was also a 38 per cent rise in the number of serious assaults. Mr Hardwick said: 'In all establishments there were fights and assaults almost every day.' But the inspector said 'of most concern' was the 69 per cent increase in the number of self-inflicted deaths from 52 in 2012013 to 88 in 2013-14, the highest figure in 10 years. Mr Hardwick said the deterioration in safety and rise in violence was set against a backdrop of £84 million cuts to public sector prison running costs and £88 million saved as a result of the closure of older prisons. In addition, planned staffing reductions involved in these changes resulted in a significant loss of more experienced staff as old jails closed. Meanwhile, the total prison population rose from 84,083 at the end of April 2013, which was 96 per cent of the usable operational capacity, to 85,252 at the end of March 2014, 99 per cent of the usable operational capacity. And ministers are pushing through a significant policy agenda, the inspector said, including Government plans to transform rehabilitation. Prisons Minister Andrew Selous said: 'The last year has seen the Prison Service manage major organisational change to create significant savings for the taxpayer - it has been challenging for staff and I thank them for their hard work and dedication. 'During this time we have always had enough staff to deliver decent and safe prison regimes, and this will continue to be our top priority. 'We remain committed to reducing violence and understanding the reasons for the recent rise in self-inflicted deaths. 'But this is a complex issue and the Chief Inspector has failed to provide any evidence to support his assertion that this is linked to the reforms made under this Government.' There was a 69 per cent increase in the number of suicides in prisons from 52 in 2012-13 to 88 in 2013-14, the highest figure in 10 years A Prison Service spokesman said: 'There is no evidence to link staffing levels, or crowding levels, to the number of self-inflicted deaths across the estate. We always closely monitor any possible trends.' Responding to the Chief Inspector's report, a Downing Street spokeswoman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'Our priority is keeping the British public safe and making sure our prisons are run in a safe and decent way. 'We will always ensure there are enough staff to deliver safe and effective prison regimes, and we will always keep looking at what more we could be doing. 'If you look at the facts and what prison staff have done in recent years, assaults are lower, numbers of positive drugs tests are lower, numbers of escapes from custody are lower, so we are making progress.' Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'Safe and decent prisons are a mark of a civilised society. 'From the Chief Inspector's shattering, incisive overview it's clear that our deteriorating prisons are less safe and less decent than even a year ago.'"

""They are in a bit of a quandary,"" said Pecht, a professor at Maryland's Clark School of Engineering. ""If they announce that electronics is a problem, they are probably going to be in a lot of trouble, because nobody's going to drive the car. So at this stage, they don't want to announce there is any electronic problem."" But according to Pecht, who is an expert in failure analysis and has written a book on sudden acceleration in automobiles, complicated electronics -- not a mechanical issue with the gas pedal -- lie at the heart of Toyota's problems. And three other independent safety analysts contacted by CNN also conclude that neither floor mats nor stuck gas pedals are an overwhelming issue. ""From what people have told me about their sudden acceleration incidents, most of them have have got nothing to do with the sticking pedal at all,"" said Antony Anderson, an electronics consultant in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. Anderson said electronic throttle controls, which largely have replaced mechanical accelerators, can malfunction in ways he compared to an occasionally disobedient child. ""We've all had that type of experience, and I'm afraid that is the sort of experience that can happen with any piece of electronics, with an electronic throttle,"" he said. And Sean Kane, who runs a company called Safety Research Strategies in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, said, ""Toyota's explanations do not account for the share of unintended acceleration complaints that we have examined."" Toyota officials dispute any assertion that the complicated array of electronics in its cars has an impact on the acceleration issues that have dominated headlines in the past weeks. ""After many years of exhaustive testing by us and by other organizations, we have found no evidence of an electronic problem in our electronic throttle control systems that could have led to unwanted acceleration,"" said John Hanson, Toyota's spokesman on quality-control issues. But experts like Anderson say the tests conducted by Toyota are not adequate. ""Those tests do not reproduce what actually happens in everyday life,"" Anderson said. ""They are testing for certain conditions, for certain standards, but they test, for example, signals one at a time. They don't do a whole lot of signals altogether. Whereas in a car, you've got a great cacophony of electromagnetic interference going on all the time, and you really can't rely on testing of a single frequency at one time."" As for the U.S. government's testing of Toyota's problems, the man in charge of the Center For Auto Safety, Clarence Ditlow, said that a 2007 test on a Lexus -- a Toyota brand -- by the National Highway Safety and Traffic Administration to find possible electronic interference was amateurish. ""They didn't do any real testing,"" he said. ""For all I know, they just took a garage door opener, pointed it at the engine compartment and snapped it, and that's electronic interference to see whether or not anything happened. They closed the hood, and off they went. No problem."" iReport: Prius owner stands by his car Efforts to contact the NHTSA in snow-bound Washington were unsuccessful. But Toyota spokesman Hanson said, ""It's very easy to look from outside and say, 'There is no problem with the pedal.' But this is the problem and we are fixing it."" Hanson said the company ""invited"" further testing and pointed out that NHTSA officials announced a ""fresh look"" into the whole area of electromagnetic testing, not simply limited to Toyota."

Sixteen of Scotland's greatest ever footballers as well as managers Billy McNeill and Walter Smith released a statement today calling for people to reject the independence proposals on September 18. One Tweet attacking former BBC pundit Alan Hansen even published a photograph of his house on Merseyside. One Twitter commentator described Murdo MacLeod as a Tory c*** due to his rejection of independence The Yes Scotland campaign published an aerial photograph of Alan Hansen's Merseyside home in response The team, which includes 16 players from the 1960s to the 2000s and former Old Firm managers Billy McNeill and Walter Smith issued a joint statement through the Better Together organisation. They said: 'We are proud Scots who have been proud to represent our country around the world. When Scotland calls, we answer. 'We are proud that Scotland has always stood on its own two feet but we also believe that Scotland stands taller because we are part of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is a country Scotland helped to build. 'We urge every patriotic Scot to help maintain Scotland’s place in the United Kingdom which has served Scotland so well.' The intervention of the high profile footballers has not been welcomed by people promoting a Yes vote. Former Match of the Day pundit, Alan Hansen is among 16 former Scottish players to reject independence Former Old Firm managers Billy McNeill, left, and Walter Smith, right, are 'managing' the squad of 16 Some of the football stars, such as Alan Hansen and Paddy Crerand  have been criticised for joining the debate as they no longer live in Scotland. Hansen left for Liverpool in 1977 while Crerand arrived in Manchester in 1963. Other footballers such as Ally McCoist faced abuse over the fact that previous comments may have been seen as being in favour of independence. Murdo MacLeod was accused of wanting to strip and privatise the National Health Service which saved his life. Other Twitter users described him as a Tory. Other pro-independence supporters questioned Hansen's qualifications for commenting on economic matters Paddy Crerand's relevance to the debate was raised over the length of time he has lived in England Pro-independence activists criticised some of the players over the fact that they no longer live in Scotland Scottish Labour's deputy leader Anas Sarwar praised the intervention of the footballers. Speaking to the Daily Record, he said: 'These men have played for the national team, have led Scotland and are now saying what they believe is best for Scotland.This shows that there is no shortage of passion and patriotism from those that are voting No. 'This isn’t a choice about whether Scotland is a nation or not as, these legends show, Scotland already is a proud nation. 'This is a choice of what vision we think is best for our future in Scotland and we believe that is solidarity, unity and teamwork.' Former Manchester United manager David Moyes, left, and current Rangers manager Ally McCoist have also lent their support to the No campaign according to the Better Together campaign Speaking at an event to launch the statement in Glasgow, football commentator and Better Together supporter Archie Macpherson called on the No side to inject more heart into its arguments during the final days of campaigning. He said: 'It has been a logical and rational presentation of facts on the currency, North Sea oil, pensions and so on, which are absolutely vital, but it has got to be backed up with conviction and passion. 'So it is not just reasoned arguments - you have got to reach out and communicate with people.' Some pro-independence supporters showed a statement by Ally McCoist designed to damage the No campaign Mr Macpherson, who recently spoke out for the union at a rally in Dundee, added: 'All these figures played with passion - people on the terracing responded with passion, passion was at the core of football in Scotland, and it was only passion that kept us going against bigotry. 'And they are backing the last home stretch passionately and the people on the terracing will recognise that, and I am sure they will go with them.' The full line-up includes Alex McLeish, Jim Leighton, David Moyes, Alan Hansen, Willie Miller, Paddy Crerand, Davie Provan, Barry Ferguson, Bertie Auld, Denis Law, Ally McCoist, Derek Johnstone, Murdo MacLeod, Ian Durrant, John Brown and Frank McAvennie. However, following today's announcement, members of the pro independence movement have taken to social media to criticise Hansen's intervention in the debate. One Twitter account for the Yes Scotland campaign even published an aerial photograph of Hansen's Merseyside house. Michael Stewart, a former Scottish international footballer, pundit and Yes Scotland campaigner, said: ""It's always interesting to hear different views on this big issue, and I am hearing many, many other voices within the football world who are backing Yes. 'The real strength of the Yes campaign is seen in the many fans' groups who are backing independence right across the country. 'And this is just symbolic of the groups and movements from all walks of life in the powerful, ever-growing grassroots movement who, I believe, will help deliver the all-important Yes vote in just over a week's time.' In recent weeks, celebrities such as JK Rowling, Sir Alex Ferguson and Susan Boyle have all previously come out in support of a no vote. David Bowie used his acceptance speech at the Brit Awards to urge 'Scotland stay with us'. However, comedian Frankie Boyle and James Bond star Sir Sean Connery have both said Scotland would benefit by independence. With polling day approaching on September 18, the gap held by the No campaign has fallen to just six points with 53 percent of the population planning to reject independence - down from 73 per cent in May. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond is confident that the Yes campaign can close the gap by September 18 The Scotland Legends campaign features former players and managers of both Celtic and Rangers"

The six-year-old local girl received a trophy and a certificate in front of a sea of television cameras from the organizers of the Confucius Peace Prize, which also comes with an award of $15,000. The ceremony's hosts said Zeng was chosen to accept the award on behalf of Lien Chan, the real winner and Taiwan's former vice president, because ""children symbolize peace and future."" Members of the prize jury said Lien, who they deemed had made major contributions to bridging the gap between Taiwan and mainland China, could not attend the event for ""reasons known to everyone"" -- but apparently not to the recipient himself. ""We know who Confucius is, but don't know anything about this prize,"" Ting Yuan-chao, director of Lien's office in Taipei, told CNN earlier. The hour-long award ceremony and press conference appeared thrown together at the last minute, jarred by microphone malfunction, awkward moments of silence and egregious English interpretation errors. None of these factors seemed to have deterred the organizers, who promised to make this an annual event. Brushing aside suggestions that their prize was meant to counter the Nobel award, the head of the jury insisted their focus to be promoting the ancient Chinese sage's philosophy. ""China is a great nation that has been influenced by the Confucian concept of peace for a long time,"" Tan Changliu, chairman of the prize committee, told CNN before the ceremony. ""We want to promote world peace from an Eastern perspective."" ""Europe is full of small countries that had fought each other for centuries,"" he added. ""We don't want to see people who don't understand peace to ruin the concept."" Other members of the jury launched tirades against the United States, accusing it of destabilizing northeast Asia for staging war games in the region amid current tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Tan declined to give details about his group -- other than stressing it is a non-government organization and the prize money came from an anonymous donor -- or how the five judges selected the nominees and the eventual winner. Candidates for this year's Confucius prize included Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, Bill Gates and the Panchen Lama, a Tibetan Buddhist leader loyal to Beijing. Of the eight nominees, only a Chinese poet, Qiao Damo, showed up and said it was a great honor to be chosen along with the other men. China has responded furiously since the Nobel committee announced its decision on October 8. Officials have repeatedly called Liu -- currently serving an 11-year sentence for ""inciting subversion"" -- a common criminal and the award a Western plot against China. A businessman first proposed a rival peace prize in a commentary on the November 17 edition of Global Times, an English-language newspaper published by the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily. Echoing government spokesmen, Liu Zhiqin said that by awarding the prize to a criminal, the Nobel committee created 1.3 billion ""dissidents"" in China. ""We often stress the need to fight for the right to speak,"" he wrote. ""China's civil society should consider setting up a 'Confucius Peace Prize'... to declare China's view on peace and human rights to the world."" The U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a non-binding resolution to praise Liu Xiaobo, prompting strong condemnation from Beijing. ""We urge relevant U.S. lawmakers to realize their mistake, change their arrogant and unreasonable attitude and show respect for the Chinese people and national sovereignty,"" said Jiang Yu, a foreign ministry spokeswoman. Back at the Confucius award ceremony, organizers refused to say if they will watch Friday's Nobel event. Despite the perceived rivalry between the two peace prizes, they seem to have one important thing in common -- the absence of their recipients at this year's award ceremonies."

Zoe Butler, 28, was horrified when she opened the tin of Princes tuna to discover the tiny species' black eyes staring back at her. After appealing to experts, scientists at the Natural History Museum believe they have identified the creature as a Cymothoa exigua, or tongue-eating louse, which live inside fish. Scroll down for video Tin monster: This is the mystery sea creature that Zoe Butler found in the can of Princes tuna Typically it enters a fish's body through the gills and attaches itself to the tongue. 'From what I can see I would support the head of a Tongue-eating louse, Cymothoa exigua or similar, Stuart Hine, Identifcation and Advisory Service manager at the Museum told the Telegraph. 'I think these are associates of smaller fish than Tuna and fish that tuna eat.' It is not the first time the parasite has almost made its way onto the plate in Britain, with a Morrisons customer shocked to discover an adult Cymothoa in a fillet of sea bass. Paul Poli, 62, was about to tuck into his dinner when he spotted the gruesome yellow creature inside the fish. He took it back to the Morrisons supermarket in Llanelli, where he had bought the sea bass from the fishmonger's counter. Ms Butler, who lives in Nottingham, discovered the species' tiny head last week after opening the can of tuna she bought in Asda. Previously experts said they thought the head may have belonged to a  juvenile crab. Right, the can of tuna in which it was found 'I opened the top of the lid and saw a purple thing, a gut sack or intestine - then I turned it round and pushed it with a fork and saw it looking back at me,' said the 28-year-old. Cymothoa Exigua is more commonly known as the tongue-eating louse and is a parasite, which attaches itself to the tongue of a fish. It enters the fish through its gills before attaching itself to the tongue. It then replaces the tongue and feeds on the blood of the fish as well as any other food that it takes in. The parasite can bite humans but is not thought to be harmful to them in any other way. 'It's got like a spiny tail along the bottom - it's quite grim. I dropped the fork, jumped back, screamed a bit and shouted for my nan to come and have a look.' After conducting their own investigation, Princes however said the creature is more likely to be a juvenile crab than the tongue-eating parasite. Dr Hany Elsheikha, associate professor of veterinary parasitology at the University of Nottingham, previously said it could be some form of crustacean. He said: 'All I can see from the picture is a body and the eyes are very prominent. 'The legs have been chopped off during the process.' An Asda spokeswoman said they were awaiting the outcome of the investigation.

The seven-song album, Hardly Workin’, released this week drops business knowledge on listeners with tracks such as The Way to Work, My Door is Always Open and the hip-hop influenced Stretch. The latter begins ‘we all know that you gotta have goals every quarter’. Groupon's failure to meet such goals was part of the reason the 32-year-old Mason was fired. CEO to musician: Groupon founder Andrew Mason has released a new album, Hardly Workin' Fired: Mason was dismissed as CEO from Groupon in February this year His ouster had been expected for months given investor concerns about the troubled company's declining stock price and financial problems. Although Groupon pioneered the daily deals business, it spawned many copycats and faced worries that people are tiring of the restaurant, spa and Botox deals that Groupon built its business on. Mason, a former punk band keyboardist, calls the album ‘motivational business music’. It is available for $9.99 on iTunes and is also streamed on Spotify. Reviews of the album have been mixed, with one comment on iTunes calling it 'hilarious'. Another user says: 'Andrew Mason is famous for being a prankster. And I'm pretty sure no self-respecting man would put out this kind of music seriously.' 'I'm debating whether or not this is great or terrible. I find it a little ironic, some of the lyrics. I think I like it but dude...at least become CEO of the record label,' reads another comment. Musician: Andrew Mason used to be a keyboardist in a punk band Musical couple: Andrew Mason is married to folk musician Jenny Gillespie Andrew Mason founded Groupon in 2008 with the concept of selling deals to local businesses. In late 2010 it was reported that Groupon’s annual revenue was $800 million. In December that year Groupon turned down a $6 billion acquisition bid from Google. In 2012 Mason was named ‘Worst CEO of the Year’ by CNBC due to his ‘goofball antics’. Mason was fired as Groupon's CEO on February 28, 2013 after the company fell far short of the profit mark. In a letter to Groupon employees on the day of his dismissal, Mason wrote, ‘As CEO, I am accountable’ In the months after his dismissal, Mason started work on his album, Hardly Workin’, which he released this week. The seven-song album is available on iTunes and Spotify. ‘This album pulls some of the most important learnings from my years at the helm of one of the fastest growing businesses in history, and packages them as music,’ Mason wrote on his blog. ‘Executives, mid-level management and front-line employees are all sure to find valuable takeaways.’ Here's the opening line: ‘If you're seeking business wisdom, you don't need no MBA, look no further than the beauty that surrounds us every day.’ And it goes on from there. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were no music videos available on YouTube. Mason, who studied music at Northwestern University, is married to folk singer, Jenny Gillespie. He founded Groupon Inc in 2008. To diversify its business, Groupon has expanded into product sales, payments services, restaurant reservations and other areas. The Chicago-based company's stock price is has nearly doubled since Mason's firing."

Twenty-four states and New York City were reporting high levels of flu activity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flu advisory report for December 30 through January 5. That's down from 29 states the previous week, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC. However, ""The only area of the country that's still relatively unaffected ... is the far West Coast,"" although plenty of cases have been reported there, Dr. Joseph Bresee, chief of the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the CDC's Influenza Division, said Friday. The number of pediatric deaths associated with influenza rose by two, according to the CDC. There have been 20 deaths of people under the age of 18 since the flu outbreak began. While the CDC does not count the number of adult deaths related to the flu, some states do, and that data suggests dozens have died. According to the latest CDC activity map, flu levels dropped in several states, particularly in the Southeast, including Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Arkansas and Kentucky. In the Northeast, levels in some states have also improved, such as New York, but New York City remains among the areas of high activity. The number of states reporting widespread activity, however, increased to 47 from 41, according to the CDC's flu advisory report. The only states without widespread activity are California, Hawaii and Mississippi. ""Widespread"" means that more than 50% of geographic regions in a state -- counties, for example -- are reporting flu activity. It addresses the spread of the flu, not its severity. ""Bottom line: It's flu season,"" Frieden told reporters. Flu activity is ""elevated"" in most of the United States, he said, and ""it may be decreasing in some areas, but that's hard to predict ... influenza activity ebbs and flows."" Officials will know in the next couple of weeks whether the season has peaked, he said. ""The only thing predictable about the flu is, it's unpredictable."" ""... We are into what would classically be described as a flu epidemic,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday. ""It's still on the uptick,"" he said. ""Remember, once it peaks, you still have a considerable amount of time where there is a lot of flu activity, and right now it may have peaked in some places, but for the most part, it has not yet peaked,"" Fauci said. Many reports of emergency rooms and clinics being overwhelmed with patients could be linked to other illnesses, too. This is also a prominent season for many other respiratory viruses, Bresee said. Norovirus, which causes diarrhea and vomiting, has also been circulating. Vaccination Although the flu vaccine is far from perfect, it's the best prevention tool we have, Frieden said. You can still get it -- it's better late than never. The flu vaccine is about 62% effective, Frieden said. ""The 62% -- we'd love it to be better, but it is actually a substantial public health benefit for the population,"" Bresee said. Based on vaccine coverage surveys, 37% of Americans had been vaccinated by mid-November, CDC officials said. That's about on track with what was seen at this time last year. ""We have seen a lot of vaccination happening in the last couple of weeks,"" Bresee said. ""I don't know where we'll end up this year."" Vaccine manufacturers told CNN on Thursday that there is plenty of vaccine for those who want to get a flu shot. However, there are reports of spot shortages of the vaccine, Frieden said, so call your provider ahead of time if you still want to get the vaccine. ""You may have to check in several places to find the vaccine, because most of the more than 130 million doses that were produced by vaccine manufacturers this year have already been given,"" he said. Early flu season The flu came early this season, and cases are more severe than last year, health officials say. Massachusetts is one state that the CDC had identified as having high activity of influenza-like illness based on the week ending December 29, but downgraded it to ""moderate"" activity in Friday's update. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino had declared a public health emergency in the city Wednesday because of the flu. Since October 1, there have been 700 confirmed influenza cases among Boston residents, according to Menino's office; that's 10 times more than were seen in all of last year's flu season. There have been 18 flu-related deaths this season in Massachusetts, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Hospitalization rates are higher than in the last two years, Kevin Cranston of the state's Bureau of Infectious Diseases told WCVB. Most deaths have been in older patients, he said. Menino is collaborating with the Boston Public Health Commission and community health centers to offer free vaccination clinics this weekend. The mayor urged residents to stay home from work or school if they are sick, and to get flu shots. ""This is the worst flu season we've seen since 2009, and people should take the threat of flu seriously,"" Menino said in a statement. More than 4% of emergency department visits at Boston hospitals are from flu cases, up from 1% during non-flu season. Massachusetts General Hospital has already counted 532 cases of flu among patients, which is more than the Boston hospital saw in any of the previous three flu seasons, spokeswoman Kristen Stanton said Wednesday. Signs posted throughout the hospital discourage anyone from visiting who has a cough or fever, she said, and anyone who does visit with those symptoms must wear a mask and perform hand hygiene. All staff must wear a mask when caring for possible flu patients, and staff members who have not been vaccinated must wear a mask while caring for any patient. As an extra precaution amid flu fears, Bishop Robert P. Deeley of Boston sent a note to all pastors in the Boston Archdiocese suggesting that during the Sign of Peace, ""the faithful, instead of a handshake, may bow to the persons nearby."" Similarly, in Washington, a note from the Archdiocese's communications office says that parishioners don't have to shake hands or receive communion from the chalice. ""Those who are sick may wish to watch the Sunday TV Mass on their television at home and pray in solidarity with their parish community,"" the statement said. Deaths in other states The CDC only tracks pediatric flu-related deaths, but some individual states release reports of influenza deaths among adults. The Oklahoma Department of Health said Thursday the state has had eight influenza-linked deaths since September 30, while the Minnesota Department of Health has recorded 27 flu-related deaths. ""We are clearly at a high level of influenza activity in the state,"" Minnesota Health Commissioner Dr. Edward Ehlinger said in a statement. ""But it's important to keep this year in perspective: What is occurring has happened before."" The number of flu-related deaths elsewhere, according to state health officials: -- Pennsylvania has had 22 deaths. Most of the deaths were among people older than 65. -- Indiana has 13 confirmed adult deaths and two pediatric deaths. -- Arkansas has seven confirmed flu fatalities. -- South Carolina has counted 22 deaths. -- In Illinois, there have been six deaths. -- In Michigan, there have been four pediatric deaths. Type of flu The type of flu that is going around is called H3N2, which is often linked to more serious disease, compared with some other flu varieties, Fauci said. That type of flu matches up well to the vaccine that is being distributed and given out throughout the United States. People may get more complications from this particular strain of H3N2, ""which may make them ill for a longer period of time,"" Dr. Michael Jhung, medical epidemiologist in the influenza division at the CDC, told CNN's Mary Snow. Symptoms typically last up to seven days for a normal infection, he said. If you have the flu, how are you treating it? Send photos of your flu survival kits. CNN's Joe Sutton and Maggie Schneider contributed to this report."

'A lot of them are students and there is a huge amount of anger locally about the Coalition’s cuts.’ Another Labour source said the party was aiming to produce a ‘Portillo moment’ - a reference to Michael Portillo’s shock defeat at the 1997 election which ruled him out of the subsequent Conservative leadership contest. The revelation threatens to plunge relations between Mr Clegg and Mr Miliband into the deep freeze at a time when the Lib Dem leader is trying to reach out to Labour about the possibility of forming a coalition after next year’s election. In an interview for a BBC Radio 4 documentary broadcast yesterday Mr Clegg said Labour had ‘changed’ and suggested the party was becoming more responsible on the economy. The Lib Dem leader was also scathing about his Tory coalition partners, saying they had lurched to the right and lost touch with the concerns of ordinary voters. Ideology: In an interview for a BBC Radio 4 documentary broadcast yesterday Mr Clegg said Labour had 'changed' and suggested the party was becoming more responsible on the economy ‘They’ve become much more ideological,’ he said. ‘They’ve returned much more to a lot of their familiar theme tunes. ‘I think it would be best for everybody if the Conservative Party were to rediscover a talent for actually talking to mainstream voters about mainstream concerns.’ Mr Miliband yesterday rejected Mr Clegg’s overtures, saying he was focused on securing a Labour victory next year. ‘I think what I’m looking for is a majority Labour government,’ he said. ‘There are such big issues that the country faces, I think Nick Clegg should be worried about the Liberal Democrats.’ When pushed on whether he would consider a coalition with the Lib Dems, Mr Miliband said: ‘I don’t think the parties, in advance of elections, should be engaging in this. I think what they should be engaging in is how are we going to change the country? What are we offering the country? And that’s what I’m interested in.’ Many senior Labour figures see Mr Clegg as an obstacle to a potential coalition deal. They argue it would be impossible for a man who has propped up a Conservative Prime Minister for five years to ever be accepted into a Labour-led government. Previous efforts: The last party to attempt a 'decapitation strategy' was the Lib Dems, who tried to oust the then Tory leader Michael Howard during the 2005 election Removing Mr Clegg from Parliament would force him to quit as Lib Dem leader, leaving Labour to deal with a more palatable figure if the election produces another hung parliament. Mr Clegg has one of the safest Lib Dem seats in the country, with a majority of 15,000. Labour has never won the seat. But the constituency also has one of the highest concentrations of student voters in the country. Labour believes many of them remain furious with Mr Clegg for his betrayal over student tuition fees. Ironically the last party to attempt a ‘decapitation strategy’ was the Lib Dems, who tried to oust the then Tory leader Michael Howard and senior figures, including David Davis and Oliver Letwin at the 2005 election. The initiative was largely unsuccessful after Tory activists flooded the targeted constituencies to shore up their vote."

Sir Jonathan Ive told the audience at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco his feelings on the matter were 'a bit harsh'. 'I don't see it as flattery,' he said, 'I actually see it as theft.' Scroll down for video Sir Jonathan also revealed this - the first phone he ever designed. Thankfully, his vision was refined for the iPhone. Sir Jonathan  said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals. 'When you're doing something for the first time, for example with the phone, and you don't know it's going to work, and you spend seven or eight years working on something, and then it's copied — I have to be honest, the first thing I think isn't 'ooh, that was flattering. 'All those weekends I could have had at home with my lovely family but didn't, but the flattery made up for it.' The designer was asked about Xiaomi, a Chinese firm which has been accused of copying Apple's style. Not an iPhone: the Xiaomi Miui 6 handset, which many have said is simply a copy of the iPhone The firm's latest software and handset looks extremely similar to Apple's iOS 8 software. The designer also gave a rare insight into how his team works, revealing there are just 16 or 17 people. 'It's grown steadily over the last 15 years,' he said. 'We've worked hard to keep it small. Sir Jonathan Ive spoke with Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter in a rare interview 'One of the advantages of being part of a design team that's been around for a long time is we've had the luxury to develop our process. 'We meet three or four times a week. 'The designers gather around the same kind of tablets you see in Apple Stores. 'We stand around those tables...and we draw. It really galvanizes and focuses our team.' He also spoke about the team's work on Apple Watch. 'Steve was the most focused person I've met in my life. 'It's terrifying that when you really truly focus, it seems a bit illegal. 'You can achieve so much. 'What focus means is saying no with every bone in your body to something you know is a good idea but you say no because you're focused on something else. I remember talking to Steve Jobs and asked why he was perceived as harsh. 'And I said couldn't we be more moderate? And he said why? And I said because I care about the team. 'And he said: 'No Jony, you're just really vain. You just want people to like you. I'm surprised at you, because I thought you really held the work up as the most important and not how you are perceived by people.'' 'People misunderstand Steve because he was so focused' 'On the Apple Watch, there were many technologies that started with the 'what if' and 'how do we do this? he revealed. 'It's a really great place to be able to glance quickly at information. 'When we started working on it, it seemed like a natural place for technology to end up.'"

In an interview with the state-controlled Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation to mark his 89th birthday, Mugabe said he had nobody left to share memories of the 1930s and Fifties or of years spent chasing girls. He said that his colleagues were much more likely to listen to him than share ideas because they were too young to match his knowledge. Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has complained of being lonely now that his contemporaries are dead The president, who is Africa's oldest leader, said that 78-year-old Didymus Mutasa, the minister for state for presidential affairs and the Zanu PF secretary for administration, was the only minister who could come close to sharing his experiences. Politicians who were involved with the fight for independence alongside Mugabe, such as three consecutive vice-presidents Joshua Nkomo, Joseph Msika and John Nkomo, have since died in office. Joshua Nkomo died in 1999, his successor Msika in 2009, while John Nkomo died of cancer in January this year. Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since gaining independence from Britain in 1980, told ZBC that he looked down on his fellow politicians because of their relatively tender age. He said: 'They have not had the same experience, the same length of life and, therefore, the same advantage of gathering as much knowledge and experience as yourself. 'And so you can't discuss with them things that happened in the 1930s or even 1950s. 'You take my Cabinet as it is: there is no one I can talk to about how we used to approach girls or we would go to this and that place, riding bicycles. 'There are others like Mutasa. He comes close, but others are just children. 'You feel that loneliness. You have lost others and sometimes you think of it and it makes you very lonely.' Mugabe, who is married to his 47-year-old former secretary Grace, told the broadcaster: 'The consoling part of it is that, well fine, there are young ones and young minds you can talk to. 'You can also try to educate, you can also try to relate a bit of history to and so on and so forth. But they remain young ones who listen much more than they share ideas with you.' Mugabe's complaints may not be taken too seriously by some, reminded of the 2004 film Team America, where a puppet of the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il sings about his loneliness. Mugabe's complaints may remind some of Team America, where a puppet of the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il sings about being lonely Minted: Dictator Robert Mugabe had the coins made to celebrate his 89th birthday In the song, written by South Park and Book of Mormon creator Trey Parker, the puppet sings about having nobody to relate to while alone on his throne. And the president clearly isn't too sad about his advancing years as he ordered gold coins to be made bearing his image to mark his 89th birthday and celebrated the day with a lavish party and four tier cake - at a time while Zimbabwe is one of the poorest countries in the world."

The watershed for marriage is the culmination of 30 years during which cohabitation has become the norm and successive governments have ceased to offer tax breaks, legal privileges or state approval to the married. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that 21.6million of the 44.9million adults who live in England and Wales are married – 48.4 per cent of the population. The number of those who have never tied the knot has doubled since the 1970s. The statistics also highlight the rise of the so-called freemale, revealing that almost one in three women have never wed. Nearly eight million women live the single life or opt for informal cohabiting relationships rather than have a husband and family. The ONS said many of the freemales were women in their 20s and 30s, who have achieved a better standard of education than boys and have gone on in ever greater numbers to pursue careers. Married people first appeared to fall into a minority three years ago, but ONS analysts insisted the numbers were misleading, saying they failed to take into account large numbers who marry abroad. A graph shows how those who are single, divorced or widowed are now outnumbering the proportion of married adults in England and Wales Further data shows that the number of adult females who are widowed has increased at a much higher rate than males The new count, however, which sets out the married population in the middle of last year, does include estimates of those who married before migrating to Britain, or while living as expats abroad, or as tourists away on holiday. The ONS presented the decline of marriage as less swift in England than elsewhere. ‘The proportion of the adult population of England and Wales who are married is one of the highest in Europe,’ it said. The estimates said 21,643,000 are husbands or wives, while there are just under 16million single people who have never married and just over 3.1million divorcees. The remainder is made up of widows or widowers. The combined count of never-married and divorced people amounts to nearly 46 per cent of the population and at current rates will overtake the married population within a few years. Cohabitation is fuelling the destruction of the family while separations and divorces have brought suffering and loneliness, the Vatican said yesterday. It declared that Catholic couples should not set up home together before marriage."

Jeanette Gibbons – who introduced Gemma to the sport and nurtured her on the path to Olympic standard – lost her battle with leukaemia when her daughter was just 17. So yesterday, in possibly the most poignant moment of the Games, millions of viewers around the world witnessed the moment Mrs Gibbons could not. And ‘Our little Gem’ as she once called her, won the hearts of a nation. Afterwards she spoke of her joy at getting so close to gold – and her frustration at not being able to share it with her mother. ‘I want to say thank you,’ she told us, ‘and obviously I can’t.’ Last night her delighted grandmother Beryl Gibbons told how proud Gemma’s late mother would be if she were still alive. Silver service: Gemma Gibbons (top) was second in the under-78kg with Kayla Harrison taking gold The challenge of Harrison, a former World Champion, proved a little too strong for Gibbons Jeanette’s 81-year-old mother was too nervous towatch the final on TV at home in Sidcup, Kent. (Elsewhere, Jeanette’s twin brother, Maurice, hid in the garage). Her 81-year-old husband, also called Maurice, watched the TV with two men who were repairing the roof and announced it was over.  ‘Jeanette would be so proud,’ Mrs Gibbons said. ‘I just know she will be looking down from above. I know her death made Gemma even more determined to succeed.’ Gemma brought home Britain’s first Olympic judo medal in 12 years by taking silver after a stunning victory over French world champion Audrey Tcheumeo. That put her in the final, and prompted her message to Mum. Seen on TV, it was instantly underlined by presenter Gabby Logan, who described witnessing the moment as ‘my first weep of the day’.

Golden moment: Kayla Harrison celebrates moments after securing her judo gold medal Gemma started judo as a six-year-old when Jeanette took her to the Metro Judo Club in Blackheath, South-East London. Jeanette raised Gemma  in a small council flat in Charlton after Gemma’s father left before she was born. Her mother then took on all the responsibilities of a single parent – working as a nursery nurse to help fund her talented girl’s ambition to become a champion. Within ten years she was winning gold at the British National Junior Age Championships. But tragedy struck in the spring of 2004 when Jeanette died at the age of 49, just six months after being diagnosed. One dedicated British judo fan who has followed Gemma’s rise in the sport, recalled: ‘Parents of other kids used to say that when they video recorded their kids taking  part in competitions all they could hear in the background was the voice of Gemma’s mum shouting, “Come on Gem”.’ As her career progressed Gemma won a place on the British Judo Association Sport England World Class Performance programme. This saw her leave home and move to the West Country, where she joined a full time training course at Bath University. Yesterday she finally fulfilled her ambition of competing at the Olympics – in a venue just 20 minutes’ drive from the flat she once shared with her late mother. She said: ‘We didn’t have a lot of money and any money that my Mum did have she put into me and my judo career. ‘Obviously I don’t get to say thank you for that, so that was a kind of thanks to her. I felt I would have definitely made her proud today. She was everything to me. VIDEO: Gemma Gibbons reacts to winning Team GB's first Olympic medal for 12 years!..."

Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush, Paul Ryan and Rand Paul have all garnered more attention. The more interesting question has been -- until this week, at least -- why that is the case. McDonnell has the virtue of not only having won a gubernatorial race in one of America's most important swing states but of having remained relatively popular. A new Quinnipiac University survey found that McDonnell had an approval rating of 53% and a disapproval rating of 28%. And though Virginia bars its governors from seeking a consecutive second term, there is a better than even chance that McDonnell would defeat Terry McAuliffe, the presumptive Democratic gubernatorial nominee, if he were allowed to run in 2013. The same can't be said of tea party stalwart Ken Cuccinelli, the Republican attorney general who is running to succeed McDonnell. Moreover, McDonnell's 2009 campaign was in many respects an excellent template for a national GOP campaign, as it focused on job creation and energy development while largely avoiding ideological bromides. Part of the reason McDonnell was able to run as jobs-centric pragmatist is that his socially conservative convictions were not in serious dispute. Indeed, Democrats in 2009 sought to highlight McDonnell's anti-abortion views, but to no avail. Just one year after Barack Obama had rallied moderate voters in Virginia's affluent northern counties, McDonnell managed to win many of them back. He aggressively courted Asian-American and Latino voters, an effort that helped blunt the growing Democratic advantage in these constituencies. One would think Republicans would be beating down McDonnell's door. But recently, many conservative activists have soured on McDonnell. For much of 2012, the Virginia governor has struggled to make progress on his policy agenda. Progress in some areas, like K-12 education, has been overshadowed by inaction in others, like the privatization of Virginia's state-owned liquor stores or the all-important issue of alleviating traffic congestion. Last week, however, McDonnell finally brokered a deal with the Virginia General Assembly to finance a sharp increase in new transportation spending with new taxes. This is despite the fact that McDonnell had pledged to resist any and all tax increases in his 2009 campaign. McDonnell has touted the potential benefits of the deal, emphasizing the economic costs of traffic congestion and the enormous gains that would flow from reducing it. But the tax increases have met with strong opposition from Cuccinelli, whom McDonnell has endorsed, and Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform and guardian of its Taxpayer Protection Pledge. This reaction is hardly surprising. Virginia's new transportation plan scraps the commonwealth's $0.175-per-gallon tax on gasoline, the value of which has eroded with inflation since it was first set at that rate in 1987, and replaces it with a 3.5% whole tax on motor fuel that will grow with the economy and the price level. It also raises Virginia's retail sales tax on most items from 5% to 5.3%, with a further increase to 6% in the most traffic-congested regions to pay for local transportation projects. All told, these new revenue measures will raise as much as $880 million per year, with an additional $200 million to be shifted to transportation from other spending priorities. Not everyone is furious about McDonnell's measure that would increase taxes. Some prominent voices, including Washington Post conservative commentator Jennifer Rubin and Washington Post columnist Robert McCartney, have praised the governor for addressing Virginia's transportation woes. One wonders whether McDonnell might somehow be able to turn a liability -- having reneged on his tax pledge -- into a strength by presenting himself as a pragmatic, bipartisan problem-solver. It's a long shot, given that primaries tend to be dominated by highly ideological voters. But it might be worth a shot all the same, particularly if the Republican presidential field proves thinner than expected in 2016."

Newlywed Phillip John Cleary, 34, died after his motorbike was hit by two cars on a country road just two days after marrying his fiancee Gemma. Police say they believe he lost control of his motorbike and collided with one car before hitting another. Mr Cleary, of Howden, near Hull, Yorkshire, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash on the A164, on the road between Howden and Middleton on the Wolds, on Monday evening. Tragedy: Phillip Cleary died in a motorcycle accident, just days after marrying his beautiful partner Gemma Hundreds of people have joined a Facebook page paying tribute to him, called In Memory of Phill Cleary. His sister Lisa Cleary wrote: 'My big brother. You have grown up to be such a kind-hearted, funny and generous man with such a great spirit. 'You were taken way too young and at such a special time in your life. 'You will be in my heart and in my soul forever. We will all miss you so much.' She later posted: 'Phill, it's very apparent that you touched so many people's lives and will leave a huge hole in all our hearts. 'Everyone is saying you are a legend and I have to agree.

'Lost control': The scene of the fatal collision on the A614 outside Middlethorpe Farm where Mr Cleary passed away Scene of the accident: Family and friends have taken to Facebook to pay their respects to the popular newlywed His mum Sue Cleary, of east Hull, simply wrote: 'My darling son I love and miss you so much.' Friend Richard Giles posted: 'I will never forget your trembling bottom lip when you saw Gemma walking down the aisle. 'In my drunken state, I was thinking of sneaking off to bed on Saturday without saying goodbye, if I did I wouldn't have got to say how happy I am for you and proud I was to be part of your big day.' Ruth Colarieti, of San Luca restaurant in Hessle, said Mr and Mrs Cleary were looking forward to their wedding when they visited the restaurant last week. She wrote: 'So shocked and saddened to hear of this devastating news. 'Phil and Gemma were in the restaurant only last week telling us how excited they both were for their wedding on Saturday. Such a lovely couple with the world at their feet.' A HUmberside Police spokesman said: 'He was riding a blue coloured Honda motorcycle and was travelling along the A614 from Howden in the direction of Middleton on the Wolds, when the it is believed he lost control of the motorcycle. 'This resulted in a collision with a silver coloured Toyota Rav, which was travelling in the opposite direction.

A security expert has published 10 million passwords and their corresponding usernames to shed light on how people pick their pins. Mark Burnett claims his move is for research purposes and is worried that it may incur the wrath of the FBI Mr Burnett said in a blog post that his decision to publish the data in full on Monday evening - which was gathered from a thousands of global incidents over the last five years, instead of a specific hack - was so experts can better understand how people pick their passwords. For example, the data could be used to work out how often people include their usernames within their passwords, Ars Technica reported. ‘Analysis of usernames with passwords is an area that has been greatly neglected and can provide as much insight as studying passwords alone,’ he wrote. Mr Burnett said that his decision to publish the data in full on Monday evening, was so experts can understand how people pick their passwords. He stripped out necessary data to stop it criminal hackers (illustrated) using the passwords for unscrupulous means Avoid favourite sports. ‘Baseball’ and ‘football’ were both in the top 10 worst password list. Birthdays and years of birth are easy to guess with the help of personal information. Common names such as Michael and Jennifer are insecure, with many making SplashData’s Top 50 list, too. Experts suggest using eight mixed types of characters, with seemingly random combinations if possible. They say that passphrases – short words with spaces or other characters separating them – are easy to recall and are relatively secure if seemingly random words are used. Experts also advise having different passwords for different sites, instead of relying on one, which if hacked, could prove particularly serious. He said he is concerned that the publication of the data may get him in legal trouble, however. ‘Recent events have made me question the prudence of releasing this information, even for research purposes,’ he said, citing the example of the prosecution of Anonymous activist Barrett Brown. 'The FBI took advantage of him linking to a data dump to initiate charges of identity theft and trafficking of authentication features,' according to Burnett. ‘I think this is completely absurd that I have to write an entire article justifying the release of this data out of fear of prosecution or legal harassment. ‘I had wanted to write an article about the data itself but I will have to do that later because I had to write this lame thing trying to convince the FBI not to raid me.’ In his defence, the researcher said: ‘In the case of me releasing usernames and passwords, the intent here is certainly not to defraud, facilitate unauthorised access to a computer system, steal the identity of others, to aid any crime or to harm any individual or entity. ‘The sole intent is to further research with the goal of making authentication more secure and therefore protect from fraud and unauthorised access.’ To ensure that the logins could not be used for illegal purposes, he removed the domain portion from email addresses, mixed up data from different leaks so it could not be traced to any particular company and removed keywords such as company names or any data that could be linked to an individual. He also removed information that could be a credit card number and any accounts suspected as belonging to government or military members. ‘Furthermore, I believe these are primarily dead passwords…and this data is largely useless for illegal purposes, Mr Burnett wrote. Mr Burnett said: ‘The sole intent is to further research with the goal of making authentication more secure and therefore protect from fraud and unauthorised access.’ A report by SplashData released in January revealed that ‘123456’ was the most popular credential last year, followed by ‘password' (illustrated) This means that passwords have already been changed and that all the data is already available online. ‘…I have taken extraordinary measures to make this data ineffective in targeting particular users or organisations.’ In January, a report by SplashData revealed that ‘123456’ was the most popular credential last year, followed by ‘password.’ The most used passwords of last year were also the most insecure, causing security experts to urge users to pick less obvious login details to keep their information safe.

BAFTA-winning star Miriam Margolyes criticised her native land for its lack of energy and optimism after a citizenship ceremony presided over by Australian prime minister Julia Gillard. She said: 'I don’t like class distinction and there is far too much of that in England. 'There’s an energy here - an optimism, a vitality. I think England doesn’t have that any more. There’s an irony and not accepting bull**** and I love that, that straight-talking stuff.' Miss Margolyes, 71, took a pledge of allegiance to Australia with 100 other people at a ceremony in Canberra on Saturday, which was Australia Day. The actress, best known for playing Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter films between 2002 and 2011, has divided her life between homes in London and Robertson, New South Wales, for years as her partner, Heather, is Australian. Mrs Gillard told the audience at her citizenship ceremony: 'This is your new country, and you’ll never want another. Welcome to citizenship. Welcome to Australia. Welcome home.' Miss Margolyes, who was awarded an OBE for services to drama in 2001, will also keep her British citizenship. Explaining her decision to seek dual nationality, she said: 'My partner of 44 years is Australian and she is the main reason for becoming Australian - because I want to be closer to her. BAFTA-winner: Miss Margolyes in  Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets 'We met in 1968 in London when she was on a research trip to London. Being in Australia makes me happy, my partner is Australian and my home is in Australia and it’s ridiculous not to be Australian - it’s a logical step to take. 'I think I should be described as 'bi'- not bisexual because I’m not - I’m gay - but 'binational' because I retain British nationality and I add to it being Australian, which is like having your cake and eating it.' Despite her attack on the British class system, Miss Margolyes said she still considers herself to be British as well as Australian because of her English accent. She said: 'I am not the sort of person who divests myself of everything that came before I came to Australia. 'I want to take all the knowledge and experiences I gained when I was in England and put it at the service of Australia, because I have to bring something to Australia, not just money but myself. Expat: Miss Margolyes was awarded an OBE for services to drama in 2001 'It would be absurd to say I’m not British - you can hear it when I speak.' Born in Oxford, Miss Margolyes started her acting career in the 1962 Cambridge Footlights comedy group alongside future Monty Python stars John Cleese and Graham Chapman. She won the BAFTA for best supporting actress for the 1993 Martin Scorsese film The Age of Innocence. In 2008, she revealed her anguish that revealing she was gay led to her mother having a severe stroke, saying: 'I spoke to her about an affair with a woman and three days later she had this stroke.

On January 3, 1985, after Leontyne Price sang those words, the audience at the Metropolitan Opera House stopped her with a four-minute ovation. Price first performed at the Met 24 years earlier, and this night, this performance would be her last on an opera stage. During the curtain call, she was showered with flowers and confetti as the audience applauded her performance, and career, for 25 minutes. She stood there, beautiful, gracious, mouthing the words ""thank you"" to admirers who clearly did not want to see her go. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what a diva looks like. I'm not sure when the meaning of the word went from someone with the talent and life journey of Price to the cast of ""The Real Housewives of (insert city here),"" but I know its erosion epitomizes all that is wrong with pop culture today: Oscar nominations surrendered to actors for carrying a tune, singing competitions judged by people who can't really sing, celebrities who are famous for being famous. Kanye West is ""a creative genius,"" but the fact that he repeatedly needs to tell people that makes him more of an anti-diva. True divas don't need to self-promote. That's what their loyal subjects are for. Price didn't request a 25-minute ovation. Her moment commanded one. ""I'm trying to exhibit good taste,"" Price said of her goodbye. ""I prefer to leave standing up, like a well-mannered guest at a party."" I long for the day when phrases such as ""good taste"" or ""well-mannered"" are uttered, let alone displayed, by the people we refer to as divas today. We've always had bubble gum and fluff and raunch, but we used to recognize those things for what they were. If being a talentless bad girl is what pays the bills, fine ... but we never used to refer to these train wrecks as ""divas."" If it sounds as if I'm blowing things out of proportion, consider this: There is a reality TV show called ""R&B Divas"" with a cast filled with one-hit wonders. It's as if eye-rolling has become the only qualification to be considered a precious gem. The reality is, today's ""divas"" are more likely to be pieces of charcoal: mass-produced, quick to flame out and apt to leave behind a filthy residue on everything they touch. The reason why the notion of a ""diva"" was reserved for the main female singer in an opera company, like a Price or Jessye Norman -- who sings in German, French and Italian and served as the inspiration for the 1982 film ""Diva"" -- is because the level of talent these women possess was thought of as rare and thus made their demanding personalities tolerable. Their recordings, treasured; their presence, captivating; their performances, transcending all others. Think Streisand, Houston, Streep. Today, we use the word so frequently, hardly anyone knows what it means anymore. For example, after this year's Grammys, Buzzfeed listed its 16 greatest divas moments and included the pitch-challenged Taylor Swift -- twice. An ABCNews.com headline actually read: ""Kim Kardashian's Diva Delivery."" Entertainment Weekly once named Rihanna ""Diva of the Year."" The very existence of such an honor should provoke nausea, because there are not enough true divas in the world to sustain such an annual award. Bit by bit, we have replaced art that is meant to be slow-cooked art with that which is microwavable (and forgettable). Thus our movie theaters are dominated by remakes and sequels, best-selling authors plagiarize, belching is considered witty. VH1 Divas is a fundraiser music showcase created to support the Save the Music Foundation. The nonprofit was designed to help restore instrumental music programs in public schools after so many were lost due to budget cuts. In the beginning, the ""divas"" who performed were along the lines of Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Mariah Carey ... voices that were iconic, even if you didn't particularly care for their music. In the latest installment of the series, Miley Cyrus was among the headliners. Miley Cyrus. Diva. No, I don't think I'm overreacting.

Rhianna Thomas, 24, was told by three different doctors it was just a harmless lump on her scalp. But over the next seven months it grew to the size of a golf ball. Surgeons finally operated after Rhianna was told it was caused by a cluster of blood cells growing under her scalp. But when she returned to have the stitches out in August she was given the earth-shattering news that she had the rare bone cancer. Still smiling: Rhianna, pictured with her mother Diane, said the most important thing to her was keeping her sense of humour The Topshop assistant from Cardiff, South Wales, first noticed the spot last Christmas. She said: 'I was washing my hair and I felt a small spot. At first I didn't think much about it but as the weeks passed I realised it was getting bigger and bigger. 'It wasn't painful just a big soft squidgy lump on my head. Soon it was the size of a golf ball. 'The doctors really didn't think it was anything to worry about - just a simple cyst to be removed.' It was only when Rhianna had an operation at Coventry University Hospital to remove it that doctors discovered it was the very rare bone cancer. 'I was told it had come back as cancerous - a rare form of Sarcoma, with only 25 to 30 cases in the world,' she wrote on her blog. Rhianna Thomas pictured before her operation Sarcomas are rare cancers that develop in the supporting or connective tissues of the body such as muscle, bone, nerves, cartilage, blood vessels and fat. Rhianna underwent a life-saving operation to remove any remaining cancer cells, which involved a skin graft from her leg. Rhianna said: 'I couldn't take it in because it was such a huge shock. Not knowing what was going to happen was pretty scary. 'I had to have part of my head shaved. I loved my hair and would spend hours straightening and going to the hairdressers having it coloured. 'But I knew losing my hair was the least of my worries. After the operation my head was bandaged up for a week so I couldn't see it. 'Thankfully the operation was successful and all the cancer was removed and the doctors able to obtain a clear margin around where the cancer had been.' But the fashion marketing graduate has refused to stop smiling. She has even managed to switch jobs and now works for George, the fashion label of the Asda supermarket. She said: 'On the bright side I'm saving time not having to do my hair each morning and I haven't had any bad hair days. 'Hats have become my new best friend and I have at least 15 different ones.

Tony Halsall was paid the sum after leaving his post at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust in disgrace last year. The trust in Cumbria is currently the subject of a police probe into up to 16 needless baby deaths as well as the deaths of two mothers. And in a scandal which has been compared to that of Mid Staffordshire, recent data shows a total of 500 people may have needlessly died in the last four years. Yesterday, politicians reacted with fury at the payout, saying it was cheating taxpayers and ‘rewarding failure’. Mr Halsall stepped down in February 2012 but still receives his salary of £150,000 a year, which will only be cut off in October this year. It is understood the payments, which equate to £225,000 overall, were viewed as a severance package. Local Lib Dem MP Tim Farron said: ‘The level of this package will shock people – £225,000 is too much for the failure that he presided over.’ After Mr Halsall stepped down, he agreed to go on ‘secondment’ for 12 months. As part of the deal, he is also entitled to his existing benefits, his lease car and the costs of career management advice up to the value of £5,000. He will also be paid during a six-month notice period. He was gagged from talking about  it and the trust has until now refused requests to reveal the scale of the payout. MPs suggested they chose to release the information on Budget day in an attempt to ‘bury’ the news. During Mr Halsall’s tenure at the trust, it was criticised on several occasions by watchdogs including the Care Quality Commission and the Commons health select committee. Police are investigating deaths at Furness General Hospital, in Barrow, one of its two main maternity units. A total of 30 families are reported to be taking legal action against the trust over mother and baby deaths and cases of cerebral palsy. Lib Dem MP Tim Farron said: 'The level of this package will shock people £225,000 is too much for the failure that he presided over' Managers have been accused of covering up patient deaths as they chased the prize of foundation trust status. Morecambe Bay became a foundation trust in 2010 despite warnings from the regional director of the NHS regulator that patients’ lives were in danger. In 2011 it had the highest mortality rate of any trust in England. A new report into the CQC’s regulation of the trust, due to be published this month, is expected to find that it had failed to take adequate action to protect patients. John Cowdall, chairman of the trust, said the arrangement with Mr Halsall ‘avoided the potential for a long drawn out dispute that would have been expensive and time consuming’. The deal involved going on secondment to NHS Confederation as an associate director. The national body represents all those organisations which provide health services and speaks on their behalf. It is understood he took the role on condition that he would be paid his salary of £150,000 a year by the trust up to October 5, 2013."

The insightful look at the world of pornography shows just how easy it is for teenagers, in particular, to get caught up in a sex trade that promises big bucks and fame. But in a revealing peek into the billion dollar industry, documentary filmmakers exposed how professionally produced films are being made to look like home movies. Scroll down for video Girls: In a revealing peek into the billion dollar industry, documentary filmmakers exposed how professionally produced films are being made to look like home movies Hot Girls: The director/producer Ronna Gradus, actress/producer Rashida Jones, center, and director/producer Jill Bauer from 'Hot Girls Wanted' 'Hot Girls Wanted,' was shot by Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus, and produced by Rashida Jones. It showed how Craigslist ads which promised free flights to Miami bring in a constant stream of would-be porn stars. During the film, Riley, a 23-year-old 'agent' hosts half a dozen young women eager to enter the industry at his Miami home. He says casually: 'Every day, another girl turns 18.' But the brutal world of pornography only gives girls aged 18- to 21 a career span that typically lasts just three months, due to high turnover. Tressa, an 18-year-old girl featured in the film, admits she was attracted to porn as a way to escape her Texas hometown. Tressa Silguero  in 'Hot Girls Wanted': The 18-year-old featured in the film and admits she was attracted to porn as a way to escape her Texas hometown Film subjects Kendall Plemons and Tressa Silguero attend the 'Hot Girls Wanted' Premiere during the 2015 Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2015 in Park City, Utah She said she earned $25,000 in her four months in the industry, but after paying for lingerie, manicures, makeup and biweekly STD tests, she only had about $2,000 in her bank account when she quit the business. 'It's easy to take advantage of an 18-year-old girl,' she said. However, for some teenagers, the allure proves just too much, and many, who have grown up in the age of the Internet don't have many hang-ups about becoming adult stars. Worryingly, many appear to think that there is nothing wrong with being shot on film and have the attitude 'Why not get paid? We're doing it anyway.' And as pop culture has become more and more sexualized, it can even be seen as a badge of honor to partake in the sex industry. According to online porn sites, 'teen' is the most searched term in online pornography, and thousands of young people enter the amateur porn industry every day. The filmmakers said that according to current laws, it's legal for anyone with a camera who calls himself a porn producer to solicit sex. The woman is technically being paid for her 'performance,' not the sex act."

Underwater photographer Alex Tyrrell used a standard DSLR camera in an underwater housing, along with external flash strobes to create the surreal effect. His stunning images show the flora and fauna that live off the coasts of Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines illuminated in bright colours shining like aliens submerged in the deep waters. London-based underwater photographer Alex Tyrrell took these ultraviolet images of underwater creatures as he travelled across Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. He used external flash strobes to illuminate the underwater flora and fauna and, to create the glowing effect, also filmed the marine life using filters and fluorescent lighting. This image shows a golden mantis shrimp This image shows a spearing mantis shrimp. Mantis shrimps have excellent sight with eyes mounted on stalks that provide almost 360° vision When diving with a fluorescent mask the diver said he was blown away by the psychedelic colours and immediately wanted to capture the effect on camera. The 39-year-old, from London, took the photos at Koh Tao, Thailand, the Lembeh Straights, Sulawesi, Indonesia and Anilao Luzon in the Philippines. Tyrrell said: ‘I enjoy fluorescent photography as it's a bit different from normal underwater photos. 'When diving the same area repetitively and seeing the same creatures, it makes things more interesting. ‘Not too many people have done fluorescent photography well, so it's quite unique and more of a challenge. ‘My camera is a standard DSLR in an underwater housing with external strobes - but you need excitation filters over the strobes to create the fluorescent effect and then Barrier Filters over the lens to strip away the excess blue light - letting the camera record the fluorescence. ‘You also need a fluorescent light to be able to see the fluorescent in the first place and a yellow barrier filter over your mask, which performs the same task as on the camera but for your eyes.’ In one image, Tyrrell captured a hydroid decorator crab clinging to the side of coral. Small decorator crabs are often found with stingers on the top of their heads to deter predators. Decorator crabs have also been known to snap off small branches and hook them onto their shells for camouflage and defense. Another shot shows a freckled frogfish. Frogfish are masters of camouflage and change to match their surroundings. A stalk between their eyes mimics the movement of other smaller fish and is used to lure in the frogfish's prey.

Small juveniles have three distinctive white spots along the back and the species typically lives in coastal reefs, often where the fish can be well camouflaged in areas of algae and seagrass. The spines pictured along the bag are venomous While the dusky nebrotha, which looks like a cut out on a Halloween pumpkin in Tyrrell's photos, is a member of the Nudibranch family. It is found either on its own, or as part of a pair on coral and rocky reefs, particularly in sand and rubble. Nudibranch are slow moving creatures that swim using either muscular contractions, or by the millions of tiny hairs they have on their 'feet'. Nudibranch lay their eggs in a ribbon effect on the sand, and each species produces a slightly different colour egg. Among Tyrrell's images is also a Achaeus japonicus, known as the orangutan crab. It has relatively long arms that are thickly covered with fine hairs that are reddish brown in colour, similar to its mammal namesake.

Each head of the coral is formed by a colony of genetically identical polyps that release a hard skeleton of calcium carbonate. Brain corals are found in shallow warm water and use their tentacles to catch food at night. During the day, these tentacles are used for protection The fimbriated moray, pictured, is a moray eel found in the Indo-Pacific oceans, around reefs and harbours. It is often founds at depths of 147ft (45 metres). It is pale green-yellow in colour and has black spots on its face. The eel can can reach a maximum length of 31 inches (80 cm) Tyrrell used standard DSLR in an underwater housing to take these shots. He fitted it with external strobes, as well as so-called excitation filters over the strobes to create the fluorescent effect. Additionally, a Barrier filters was placed over the lens to strip away any excess blue light - letting the camera record the fluorescence.

These shocking findings arose after data released by a holiday home insurance provider revealed the extent of guests' antics and compiled a list of the worst, based on what they left behind. Among the top 10 horrid holidaymakers was one who filled his rental property with raw meat in a bid to avoid paying the bill and another who replaced his villa's EU plug sockets with British ones. Disgusting: Cottages in the UK, Spain and France were among those trashed by horrid holidaymakers The list of gruesome guests is based on a survey of holiday home owners which asked whether they had had any unexpected surprises left by departing guests. Data was then collated by insurance company, Schofields LTD who also put together a list of the worst offenders. Topping the list was the guest who filled the bin of a UK rental cottage with human waste after misunderstanding a sign that asked holidaymakers to refrain from flushing items down the toilet. In second place was a French guest who tucked raw meat into cracks in the pipes and kitchen cupboards, and an American tourist who installed a satellite dish complete with cabling and a decoder in his rental property. Vile: Particularly bad were the bathroom bin filled with poo and the plug sockets changed from EU to UK Speaking about the findings, Phil Schofield, spokesperson for Schofields Holiday Home Insurance, said: 'We were interested in discovering some of the weirdest things found and discovered by holiday home owners and, as you can see by the list, there have been some pretty horrific things. 'The team at Schofields could not believe what some Britons got up to, with the faeces in the bathroom bin definitely the worst. He added: 'While I am confident that not every holidaymaker acts like this, you should treat a holiday home as an extension of your own home. If you wouldn't do it in your own home, why would you do it on holiday? Not only will you be banned from coming back, but you ruin the experience for other travellers too.' 1. A guest in the UK filled a bathroom bin to the brim with human faeces after taking the 'Don’t Put Anything Down the Toilet' sign too literally. 2. A guest in France hid raw meat within a fitted kitchen unit after strategically removing plinths and kitchen units (in order to try and get their money back). 3. A guest in the US installed a satellite dish, fixed to the wall and complete with cabling and decoder, while staying in a holiday home. 4. A guest in France removed all the lava rocks from a gas BBQ and left a note for the holiday home owner which read: 'Some stupid idiot has put charcoal in your BBQ and it took us ages to clean it out.' 5. A guest in France left towels covered in human excrement hidden under the bed and in the closet. 6. A guest in France covered their windows with kitchen foil to apparently block out the sunlight, despite curtains and blinds being available. 7. A guest in Spain changed the electrical plugs on appliances from EU to UK. 8. A guest in the UK stole every other curtain hook in the entire property from the holiday home they were staying in. 9. A guest in the UK removed all the batteries from all the remote controls, clocks and smoke alarms in the holiday home. 10. A guest in the UK turned up the heat to maximum and then opened all the windows before leaving."

Over 100 people descended to Fiesta Island, in the city’s Mission Bay, to watch the examination, which determined the whale had been killed by a ship which fractured its vertebral column, according local newspaper reports. And Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Oceanic organisation is paying for the carcass to be towed out to sea and sunk deep into the ocean tomorrow so researchers can study its decomposition over the next several years. Examination: Over 100 people descended to Fiesta Island, in San Diego's Mission Bay, to watch the examination of the dead fin whale The cost of towing the whale is very expensive, but Virgin Oceanic's operations manager Eddie Kisfaludy said the effort made by Virgin is part of a larger vision by Branson to ‘get the world excited about exploring’ the deep ocean. Kisfaludy told the San Diego Union-Tribune: ‘The first thing that is going to happen after we sink the whale is it’s probably going to get attacked by all the deep sea critters that hang out around at 2,500 feet down. ‘That’s going to include hack fish, shrimp [and] crab and they are probably going to be working away on it for the next several years.’ San Diego lifeguards are patrolling the carcass until tomorrow and the towing will take place under the supervision of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Pregnant whale: The fin whale was pregnant when it died, leading its foetus (bottom right) be be expelled from its body 48 hours after its death Helped by lifeguards: Local lifeguards originally towed the body from the Wastewater Treatment Plant to Fiesta Island so the carcass could be examined Funding: Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Oceanic is paying for the boat and fuel to tow the whale Along with the mother whale, which could weigh up to 70 tons, its five-foot foetus had apparently been expelled from its body around 48 hours after it died, due to bloating, scientists said. The whale originally washed up near Point Loma Waste Treatment Plan on Saturday afternoon before San Diego lifeguards moved the carcass over six miles to Fiesta Island where it could be examined. Lifeguard Greg Buchanan told the newspaper: ‘Everything went according to plan but I can honestly tell you the lifeguards were struggling with the enormity of the whale.’ Sir Richard Branson’s undersea leisure venture company is paying for the boat and fuel in return for the research. The carcass will be sunk near the Scripps Submarine Canyon and Scripps Institute of Oceanography, where scientists will study the decomposing body over the years to come and see how new ecosystems form. Fin whales are the second largest living mammals after the blue whale and grow up to 88 feet in length."

Instead, the Labour leader put an assault on the wealthy and more cash for the NHS at the heart of a statist bid for power. Retreating to his party’s old comfort zone, the Labour leader railed against owners of expensive homes, bankers, Tories, energy and tobacco companies and the media. Scroll down for video Ed Miliband dropped any mention of Britain’s vast budget deficit, immigration and welfare from his final party conference speech before the General Election. Aides said the speech ‘changed’ as it was being delivered After the speech, Miliband attempted to kiss his wife Justine who pulled away but later managed to get it right Last night it emerged that he had either ditched or forgotten to deliver a planned section promising to ‘get the deficit down’ and ‘no proposals for additional borrowing’. Extracts of his address released in advance to favoured journalists also revealed he had been expected to promise to make immigrants ‘learn English and earn their way’, but failed to do so. On welfare, Mr Miliband also neglected to say that all who can work ‘have a responsibility to do so’. Aides said the speech, delivered without notes, had ‘changed’ as it was being delivered. In what was widely seen as a lacklustre appearance at the conference in Manchester, which he described as the start of a ‘job interview’ to become Prime Minister, he sketched out a vision for a decade in Downing Street. While the Conservatives told people ‘you’re on your own’, the Labour leader said that if elected he would seek to fashion an interventionist state based on something he called ‘the principle of together’. He said he would tax tobacco companies, owners of valuable properties and hedge funds to raise £2.5 billion to pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 extra GPs, 5,000 careworkers and 3,000 midwives. A ‘mansion tax’ would be introduced on more than 100,000 homes worth more than £2 million. Businesses would be required to pay a minimum wage of £8 an hour by 2020, big banks ‘broken up’ and firms that want government contracts made to take on apprentices. Developers will no longer be allowed to ‘sit on land’, which will be released for housebuilding, ‘cruel and vindictive’ cuts to housing benefit will be reversed and all electricity required to be environmentally friendly by 2030. Miliband went in for a kiss with his wife Justine but had to brush it off when she accidentally moved away The pair joked about the mishap before later having a quick peck in front of the clapping crowd and cameras The House of Lords will be scrapped and replaced with a ‘National Senate of the Nations and the Regions’ and 16- and 17-year-olds will be given the vote. ‘Friends, it is time we ran the country like we know it can be run,’ Mr Miliband said in the 68-minute speech. The Labour leader, who used the word ‘together’ 47 times, said he aimed to ‘restore people’s faith in the future’. ‘I’m not talking about changing a policy, or simply a different programme. But something that is bigger: transforming the idea, the ethic, of how our country is run. ‘What people across England, Scotland and Wales, across every part of the UK, are saying is this country doesn’t care about me. Politics doesn’t listen. 'The economy doesn’t work. And they are not wrong. They are right. But this Labour Party has a plan to put it right.’ Mr Miliband also reeled off a list of people and organisations he said he had ‘stood up to’, including Rupert Murdoch over phone hacking, banks over bonuses, payday lenders and energy companies over their profits and the Daily Mail when it ran an article about his father’s views. After the speech, the Labour leader was forced to brush off an embarrassing mishap after moving in to kiss wife Justine - who pulled away at the crucial moment. The gaffe occurred when he brought her to the centre of the stage to wave to the crowd and cameras. The pair managed to laugh off the mishap and later had a peck on the lips to make up for it. Last night Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk said Mr Miliband appeared to have a ‘mental block’ on immigration and welfare. ‘He talks a lot in his speech about meeting Gareth and Josephine and others in the park or the pub,’ he said. ‘It seems strange that none of them he’s met have mentioned immigration and welfare. ‘You do wonder if he has a mental block about talking about these issues.’ Chancellor George Osborne said it was ‘extraordinary’ Mr Miliband ‘didn’t mention the deficit once’. ‘If you can’t fix the economy you can’t fund the NHS,’ he added. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the union Unite, Labour’s biggest financial backer, was delighted with Mr Miliband’s speech. ‘The keys of No 10 are within his grasp,’ he said. But Grant Shapps, the Conservative party chairman, said: ‘All Ed Miliband offers is more wasteful spending, more borrowing and more taxes. 'You can’t fund the NHS if you lose control of the nation’s finances and bankrupt the economy like Labour did last time.’ A Labour government will hit thousands of pubs and clubs with a late-night-opening tax – in a blunt admission of the chaos caused by its 24-hour drinking laws. Yesterday Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said drinking venues in some areas which want to open beyond midnight will be forced to pay up to £4,400 a year extra. The party leader, who used the word ‘together’ 47 times, said he aimed to ‘restore people’s faith in the future’ Aides said Mr Miliband's speech, which was given without notes, had ‘changed’ as it was being delivered Ed Miliband has an approval rating of minus 23 per cent, making him the most unpopular since Foot Ed Miliband is the most unpopular opposition leader in the run-up to a General Election since Michael Foot, polls have shown. Mr Foot is the only politician in the past 40 years to have a worse rating than Mr Miliband 12 months ahead of an election, according to researchers Ipsos Mori. Mr Miliband is languishing with an approval rating of minus 23 per cent. At this point before the 2010 election, David Cameron had an approval rating of plus 23 per cent. Only those leaders with positive approval ratings – Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and Mr Cameron – went on to become Prime Minister, while all those with negative ratings lost the election. Confronted with the appalling figures for Labour on BBC’s Newsnight, the party’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt claimed that he wasn’t concerned. ‘The great thing about being in Ed Miliband’s team is that we’re in the history-busting business,’ he said. It was reported yesterday that Mr Miliband suspects anti-semitism may be behind some of the hostility towards him."

It is the newest of many bumps and bruises the 1-ton vehicle has experienced since it landed on the red planet in August 2012. Scroll down for video A large hole has been spotted (shown) in the middle-right wheel of Nasa's Curiosity rover on Mars. The dent is the latest in several bumps and bruises the rover has experienced on the red planet, which has surprised engineers. It is not a problem for now but could become one if the hole grows in size The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 different possible landing sites before deciding to set Curiosity down in Gale Crater. Mission controllers are confident that even with one or several wheels being damaged in this way, they will still be able to achieve Curiosity’s goals. The rover is currently making its way to the base of Mount Sharp, an interesting mountain that could reveal secrets about the history of Mars. While this damage will not hinder the mission, it will be cause for concern as it shows how susceptible it really is to rocks. ‘They are taking damage,’ said Curiosity project manager Jim Erickson in California about the wheels, reports Space.com. ‘That’s the surprise we got back at the end of last year. ‘We always expected we would get some holes in the wheels as we drove. ‘It’s just the magnitude of what we’re seeing that was the surprise.' Curiosity has recently driven out of the ellipse, approximately 4 miles wide and 12 miles long (7 kilometers by 20 kilometers), that was mapped as safe terrain for its 2012 landing inside Gale Crater. It was snapped by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter crossing the 'boundary' on 27 June (pictured) Each of the six alumnium wheels is independently operated and is built to withstand the harshness of the Martian environment. This particular damage is found on the 'grousers' of the wheel (bottom wheel in this image), which is the zigzag-like pattern that helps them grip the terrain The worst case scenario is that one of the wheels could be completely torn to shreds and become unusable. This would mean it would have to be dragged across the surface of Mars by the other five wheels, and any flailing damage could also pose a risk to exposed wires. The chances of this happening are low, but the engineers are still surprised at how much of a beating the rover has taken in just under two years. One of the main culprits has been ‘caprock’, flat areas of hard Martian rock. In attempts to avoid going over these areas engineers have been trying to spot softer and sandier areas from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter currently circling the planet. Another solution to avoid such damage is to minimise turning, drive backwards of give the wheels greater control with more software. Whether any of these methods will be more successful in future in avoiding damage remains to be seen. One of the main dangers has been 'caprock', flat areas of hard Martian rock (shown). In attempts to avoid going over these areas engineers have been trying to spot softer and sandier areas from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter currently circling the planet In other Curiosity news, the rover recently celebrated its first complete year on Mars, equating to 687 Earth days. This was done having accomplished the mission's main goal of determining whether Mars once offered environmental conditions favourable for microbial life. One of Curiosity's first major findings after landing on the red planet in August 2012 was an ancient riverbed at its landing site. Nearby, at an area known as Yellowknife Bay, the mission met its main goal of determining whether the Martian Gale Crater ever was habitable for simple life forms. The answer, a historic ‘yes,’ came from two mudstone slabs that the rover sampled with its drill. Analysis of these samples revealed the site was once a lakebed with water, the essential elemental ingredients for life, and a type of chemical energy source used by some microbes on Earth. If Mars had living organisms, this would have been a good home for them. The rover is now making its way to the foothills of Mount Sharp, its ultimate destination since landing on the red planet.

The budget supermarket chain can kit out a family of four to hit the slopes for £154. The 'Specialbuys' ski range will go on sale in their stores across the UK from Thursday offering ski jackets, salopettes, snowsuits and accessories at a fraction of High Street prices. Bargain: Aldi are offering softshell ski jackets for adults for £24.99 and salopettes for £16.99 The brand hope the range will appeal to shoppers traditionally priced out of the winter travel market. But by saving money will consumers sacrifice quality and warmth on the piste? Not according to John Hill, editor of Britain's biggest ski magazine, Good Ski Guide, who has praised the supermarket for making skiing more accessible to all. He said: 'Skiing is still seen by many as an exclusive pursuit for affluent travellers when it should be a hobby that's available to all to enjoy. Ready for winter: An infant snowsuit from Aldi costs £9.99, left, while children's snow boots are £8.99 Keep warm: Base layers and thermals for men, women and children will be in the collection 'It's fantastic that Aldi has launched a range that offers not only great value but is also of comparable quality to brands on the High Street.

She said: 'I've never been skiing before but my husband Simon used to when he was younger. We had talked of taking our two children and giving it a try, but buying or hiring all the kit on top of the cost of the trip held us back. 'Now it's a real possibility for us and I’m excited about learning to ski. So many people have said how fun it is but it was always out of our budget. Skiwear isn't the only sports clothing the German-owned discounter sells. They have also had 'specialbuys' of running clothing with trainers for £14.99 and cheap kit for cyclists. The bid to attract bargain-hunting skiers comes after the store have been luring more middle class shoppers through their doors all year and have started opening stores in affulent areas such as Knutsford in Cheshire. They keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands like Hellmann's or Kellogg's, and reduce their overheads with minimalist store interiors, few staff, and charged-for plastic bags.

'Neither the summit, nor the format.' Earlier this week, the EU and the United States slapped sanctions on certain individuals that were involved in what they say was the unlawful referendum in Crimea over joining Russia. Moscow formally annexed Crimea earlier this week in the wake of the poll. The Black Sea peninsula had been part of Russia for centuries until 1954 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred it to Ukraine. Russian forces effectively took control of Crimea some two weeks ago in the wake of the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych, after months of protests and sporadic violence. The crisis erupted late last year after Yanukovych backed out of an association deal with the EU in favor of a promised $15 billion bailout from Russia. That angered Ukrainians from pro-European central and western regions.

The EU Commission president wants the summit to center on boosting the fledgling government in Kiev rather than focus exclusively on sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula Merkel said EU leaders would increase those 'level 2' sanctions against Russia when they meet onThursday in Brussels to widen the list of those whose assets are being frozen and who are banned from traveling. She also reiterated that if things worsen, the EU is prepared to move to 'level 3' measures, which would include economic sanctions. 'The European Council will make it clear today and tomorrow that with a further deterioration of the situation we are always prepared to take level 3 measures, and those will without a doubt include economic sanctions,' she said. Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has close economic ties with Russia which is its main supplier of gas and some companies are worried they would be hit if economic sanctions go ahead. The United States and its G7 allies will gather next week in The Hague without Russia to consider a further response to the Kremlin's moves in Crimea.

Last week, Merkel, who was brought up in Communist East Germany, warned Moscow that it risked 'massive' political and economic damage if it refused to change course. The government on Wednesday publicly intervened in business dealings with Russia for the first time since the escalation of the crisis by telling defence contractor Rheinmetall to halt delivery of combat simulation gear to Russia. European Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger spelled out some of the sectors further sanctions discussed by EU leaders in Brussels this week could cover.

Sitting in his garden at Kensington Palace on a warm summer day, the Duke of Cambridge, second in line to the British throne, told CNN that George is already quite a character in his first official interview since the birth in London on July 22. ""He's a little bit of a rascal, I'll put it that way,"" William told CNN's Max Foster. ""He either reminds me of my brother or me when I was younger, I'm not sure, but he's doing very well at the moment."" ""He's growing quite quickly actually.  But he's a little fighter -- he wriggles around quite a lot and he doesn't want to go to sleep that much."" William said his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, has been handling more of the night duties with baby George -- and admitted he's looking forward to going back to his job as a Royal Air Force search-and-rescue pilot in order to catch up on some much-needed sleep. ""Well, as a few fathers might know, I'm actually quite looking forward to going back to work (to) get some sleep. So I'm just hoping the first few shifts I go back I don't have any night jobs."" William, dressed casually in blue jeans and a polo shirt, laughed as he described the moment he and Catherine appeared on the steps at the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London to show baby George to the world for the first time. Prince William said: ""I think more shock was the feeling I felt, but I was on such a high anyway, and so was Catherine, about George that really we were happy to show him off to whoever wanted to see him."" ""As any new parent knows, you're only too happy to show off your new child and, you know, proclaim that he is the best looking or the best everything. It's nice that people want to see George -- I'm just glad he wasn't screaming his head off the whole way through,"" he said with a laugh. Royal baby name: The history behind George Alexander Louis Fathers around the world watched in disbelief as William, surrounded by hundreds of press photographers, deftly secured his son's car seat in the back of his vehicle on the first try -- but the prince admitted there was more than luck involved in the maneuver. ""Believe, me it wasn't my first time,"" William said, ""and I know there's been some speculation about that. I had to practice, I really did -- I was terrified it was going to fall off or the door wasn't going to close properly."" While the pictures of William climbing behind the wheel and driving his young family home from the hospital may have reinforced perceptions that he'll bring a more modern approach to Britain's monarchy, the future king told CNN it was simply more about doing things his way. Opinion: Baby helps make a monarchy matter He said: ""I am as independent as I want to be, same as Catherine and Harry. We've all grown up differently to other generations and I very much feel if that I can do it myself, I want to do it myself."" ""There are times where you can't do it yourself and the system takes over, or it's appropriate to do things differently.  But I think driving your son and your wife away from hospital was really important to me."" While the future king may have prevailed on the issue of driving his family home, he says he was less successful at avoiding that hallowed tradition of new parenthood: changing the first diaper. ""I did the first nappy, it's a badge of honor,"" he joked. ""I wasn't allowed to get away with that. I had every midwife staring at me, saying: 'You do it, you do it.'"" William told CNN that Catherine is doing ""a fantastic job"" with baby George and that his young family is now his priority. The prince said last week that he will miss living on the Welsh island of Anglesey when his three-year tour as an RAF pilot there comes to an end next month. ""For me, Catherine and now little George are my priorities -- and Lupo,"" the prince said with a smile. Thankfully Lupo, the couple's Cocker Spaniel, seems to be on board with the new addition to the family. ""He's coping all right, actually.  As a lot of people know who have got dogs and bringing a newborn back, they take a little bit of time to adapt, but he's been all right so far.  He's been slobbering around the house a bit, so he's perfectly happy."" One of William's great passions is saving endangered species in Africa. He told CNN he wants George to experience the same Africa he saw as a young man and spark a passion for preserving the unique wildlife there, much as his father, Prince Charles, did with him. ""I'll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room,"" William joked. ""We'll cover it in lots of bushes and things like that, make him grow up as if he's in the bush."" In the meantime, William said the possibility of his son carrying on the royal family's legacy in Africa isn't an immediate concern. ""At the moment, the only legacy I want to pass on to him is to sleep more and maybe not have to change his nappy so many times,"" he laughed. And like any new mother or father, the future monarch said he was surprised and amazed by parenthood so far. ""The last few weeks for me have been a very different emotional experience, something I never thought I would feel myself.  And I find, again it's only been a short period, but a lot of things affect me differently now."""

The kind of guy who says what he likes, and likes what he says. Don Revie didn’t like Clough, and I’m not convinced the greatest manager in Leeds’ history would have appreciated Cellino. Yet most Leeds fans seem to adore the Italian. Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino (centre) is pictured in the stands with the fans at Brentford on Saturday Absurd as it sounds, having a beer with fans in The Old Peacock close to the stadium, and sitting in the away end at Brentford on Saturday, has led to a situation where the Leeds fans will worship the ground Cellino walks on, and accept some of the bizarre decisions he has made in the short time he has been in charge. Cellino might turn out to be the best owner Leeds have ever had – I hope so because the city needs a thriving, healthy club to serve its huge fanbase. I lived and worked in Leeds when they last won the title in the top flight – I’m aware what the club means and how important it is in the city. On the face of it, it’s shocking that Leeds fans are so welcoming of this guy: he only turned his attention to Leeds after failing to buy West Ham. This doesn’t mean he has bad intentions, but the any club will do' approach naturally invites scepticism. Cellino asked for a huge fee from Fulham for Ross McCormack, and he got it. Fair play to him for that. So why tell the press the player refused to train, when on that day McCormack claims he was having his medical in London? No need for that from the owner, unless he’s desperate to win favour with fans. I’ve heard Leeds supporters declare openly that Cellino’s version is what 'REALLY' happened, dismissing McCormack’s version for no real reason other than he’s no longer connected to Leeds. How can they be so sure? Fulham's Ross McCormack (centre) pictured during a club training session earlier this month Brian McDermott was sacked and then reinstated and then sacked again. David Hockaday was hired from non-league - Cellino admitted he told Hockaday to 'shut the f***k up' and didn’t want his opinion. As most had predicted, Hocakday didn’t last long. If you include caretaker Neil Redfearn, there have been four managers at Leeds since Cellino took over in April. When asked why he has hired the new one, Darko Milanic, Cellino replied: 'He’s good-looking.' Throw in an ongoing troublesome yacht taxation issue back in Italy, which the Football League describes as a 'cloud hanging over Cellino' and which could still give the League cause to re-assess his qualification as a fit and proper person to own a club in this country, and it all makes you wonder why the Leeds fans have fallen for this guy. Surely a beer with the fans in the pub and a seat in the away end at Brentford weren’t enough to seduce supporters? Cellino (right) sits with former Leeds manager Brian McDermott at Vicarage Road in April this year Spending money on players might have persuaded a few. But don’t they remember Peter Ridsdale? He spent huge amounts of money on players, and the financial collapse as a consequence was painful. The truth is this: Massimo Cellino is benefiting from Leeds’ recent history. Ken Bates’ regime created a massive rift between the fans and the club. Then GFH made a mess of things, leaving the fans disillusioned and desperate. So desperate that they have seemingly taken this sacking-machine Italian with a potentially nuclear tax bomb waiting to explode, into their hearts. Former Leeds chairman Peter Ridsale (right) at the unveiling of new signing Robbie Keane in 2000 I know only too well that if you say anything remotely negative about Leeds United, their fans will hammer you. So in the week he took control of the club, Cellino gave an interview and said the words that he knew would capture the love and dedication of so many long-suffering fans. He had them when he said: 'The fans of Leeds are tired of eating sh*t and shutting their mouths.' Those fans fell for Cellino right then. I hope he doesn’t break their hearts."

Gordon Glover said he shot the one-year-old dog after it attacked livestock, killing his grandson’s pet chicken. He had initially denied seeing the dog. Miss Johnston, 70, is said to be heartbroken after learning of the death of her pet, named Bo. A farmer has insisted he only shot dead Coronation Street star Sue Johnston's dog because it killed his chickens. Gordon Glove, 69, said he killed one-year-old Bo, and another cocker spaniel, after the pair ran 'wild' into his yard in Marton, near Macclesfield and killed his chickens The Coronation Street and Royle Family star had appealed for Bo’s return when she went missing last week. The actress, who also appeared in Brookside, had been searching frantically for Bo, who ran off with another dog while being walked by a professional dog walker. Gordon Glover insists he only killed the dogs with a shotgun because they were biting his chickens The dog walker, who gave her name only as Kim, asked local farmers – including 69-year-old Mr Glover – if they had seen the dogs but they all said no. Yesterday Mr Glover said he felt awful after killing Bo and the other dog, a cocker spaniel called Hattie, with his shotgun. He said the dogs were running wild and had attacked his hens, killing one in front of his grandsons. ‘I tried to drive them away but couldn’t and in the end I got my gun,’ he said. ‘My grandsons are only five and two and they were in floods of tears. I didn’t know what else to do. I don’t understand why the dogs weren’t kept on a lead.’ Mr Glover said he buried both dogs on his farm near Marton, Cheshire. Bo and Hattie were among several dogs with the dog walker on Tuesday last week. She said they chased after a rabbit. ‘Even though I shouted they didn’t come back. I was looking for them for days,’ she added. ‘On Friday I went round all the farms with photographs. I even went to see the farmer who shot them – but he denied having seen them. ‘Sue’s my friend. It’s dreadful for her and nobody could feel worse than I do. I’ve also lost Hattie, who was my baby.’ Cheshire Police contacted Mr Glover but said he was legally entitled to shoot the dogs. The farmer said he was too embarrassed to admit that he had killed them when approached by the dog walker. Miss Johnston, who is best known for playing Barbara Royle in The Royle Family and who has just left Coronation Street, was not available for comment yesterday. She is said to be ‘devastated’ by Bo’s death. A family friend said: ‘Sue is understandably very distressed about the loss of her family pet. She’d like to thank everyone who helped her scour the area.’ The farm in Marton, near Macclesfield, where the dogs were shot dead by the farmer The dog walker, known only as Kim, said that when she took a photo of the dogs to homes in the area Mr Glover 'denied seeing them' Miss Johnston in Alderley Edge, Manchester, yesterday after it was revealed her dog had been shot Miss Johnston has just left the popular ITV1 soap after playing outspoken Gloria Price"

He successfully completed a 44-week training course as an Officer Cadet, before being commissioned in April 2006 as a Second Lieutenant in the Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals). In February 2008 he went on to complete more than two months service with the British Army in Helmand province, Afghanistan, as a Forward Air Controller for NATO forces and was promoted from Second Lieutenant to Lieutenant in April 2008. In January 2009 he began a two-and-a-half year training course to become a fully operational, full-time Army Air Corps helicopter pilot. He remains an officer in the Household Cavalry during the training period. The expedition will take place as a race between a British team, a U.S. team and a team representing the Commonwealth countries Canada and Australia. Following extensive training, from cold weather training in Iceland in March, to team training through the summer and a final session of snow preparation in October, the teams will fly to Antartica in November. They aim to reach the South Pole around December 17. In a statement released ahead of Friday's launch, Prince Harry said: 'Walking With The Wounded continues to champion our extraordinary wounded service personnel and highlight their determination and courage to face future challenges following injury on the battlefield, whether physical or cognitive. 'Their inspirational expeditions have already impacted so many and I hope they will continue to impact many more.

A Conservative MP has written to the judge, who was in charge of last year’s public inquiry into Press standards, querying his insistence that Carine Patry Hoskins had no input into its key conclusions. Rob Wilson, a parliamentary aide to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is calling for a full investigation by the Bar Standards Board into revelations that Miss Patry Hoskins and celebrities’ barrister David Sherborne are lovers. No probe: Lord Justice Leveson is refusing to investigate the affair between Carine Patry Hoskins, a member of his legal team, and David Sherborne, a lawyer representing phone hacking victims The Standards Board’s code of conduct suggests affairs between opposing lawyers should be avoided in case the perception be created of ‘a danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. Twice-married Mr Sherborne, 44, represented Hugh Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking. The father-of-three and Miss Patry Hoskins, 40, a married mother-of-two, admit going on holiday to the romantic Greek island of Santorini in August last year, days after the inquiry’s public hearings ended in July. But they claim their affair did not begin until after the Leveson report was published in November. The couple did not tell Lord Justice Leveson or his senior counsel, Robert Jay QC, about the relationship. The judge only learnt of their trip to the Greek island – during which the couple say they discussed ‘the possibility of a future relationship’ – when the Daily Mail asked him to comment on it after revealing the affair. No effect: Leveson has dismissed the idea that his report on media standards could have been tainted by the alleged relationship between Carine Patry Hoskins and David Sherborne Lord Justice Leveson has dismissed criticism that the revelations have undermined his inquiry, saying there was ‘simply no room’ for a ‘breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. He insisted Miss Patry Hoskins had ‘absolutely no input into any conclusion’ and was ‘simply not involved in any aspect’ of his proposals for Press regulation. In his letter to the judge, Mr Wilson queried why he had cited August 3 of last year, shortly before draft criticisms were sent to key players for comment, as the crucial ‘cut off’ date in the case. As controversy continues over a new system of Press regulation in the wake of the Leveson report, a senior figure said yesterday that the newspaper industry’s proposals for a Royal Charter on the issue deserve ‘equal consideration’ alongside plans drawn up by the Government. Lord Wakeham, a former Conservative Cabinet minister and ex-chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, said the proposals could meet Lord Justice Leveson’s call  for independent voluntary self-regulation. Last week the newspaper industry rejected the Government’s plans for Press regulation. It submitted a rival proposal for a Royal Charter to enshrine a new watchdog with the power to levy £1million fines on errant publishers and require prominent corrections of errors. He wrote: ‘In your letter you suggest that Ms Patry Hoskins had “no input into any conclusion as to the past treatment of those affected by Press abuses (or, indeed, the relationship between the Press and the public as considered by module one of the inquiry) or any aspect of the proposals made for future Press regulation” between August 3 and publication of your report in November 2012. ‘Is it possible that she may have had an input into the inquiry’s conclusions before August 3, 2012? ‘If the answer … is yes, I would be grateful if you would confirm what work did Ms Patry Hoskins in fact did prior to August 3 (aside from questioning witnesses).’ Mr Wilson, MP for Reading East, also asked how much of the cost of the four counsel to the inquiry–  £1,353,900 between them as of October 2012 – went to Miss Patry Hoskins. MPs have demanded that Lord Justice Leveson launch a full investigation, and a series of questions about who knew what and when remain to be answered. Miss Patry Hoskins, dubbed the ‘thinking man’s Pippa Middleton’, was required to be totally independent when testing evidence given to the inquiry on behalf of the public. She questioned witnesses, including Mr Sherborne’s clients, with grievances against the Press. At one point she trended on Twitter as #womanontheleft after being spotted by viewers who suggested she was making eyes at Mr Grant. She is understood to be divorcing her 45-year-old husband, QC Mark Hoskins."

The question is, ""Will America lead the way, as it has for a century, or will it fall behind, as it has begun to do?"" My forthcoming Mercatus Center research ""Fortress and Frontier in American Health Care"" argues that leading requires us to abandon the partisan rancor over health insurance (""Obamacare"" vs. ""repeal and replace"") and focus, instead, on innovating our way to better health. FDA-approved prosthetic hands cost around $40,000. Several years ago, a South African carpenter lost some fingers in an accident and collaborated with a Washington state puppetmaker to invent a vastly more affordable device. They adapted a 19th-century metal-and-whalebone design for a 21st-century 3-D printer to produce a hand that allows users to drive, ride bikes, play ball, grasp objects and feel normal and complete. Printed hands require only a few hours of assembly time, and materials (essentially a special glue, string and screws) cost between $10 and $50 -- 1/1000 the cost of professional models. The proliferation of printed hands began when Jon Schull at the Rochester Institute of Technology formed e-NABLE, a global, Web-based social network, to connect people who need hands with people who are interested in building them. Amateurs quickly began modifying the hands. One added an extra thumb so his son could grasp objects more easily. A student designed a hand that rotates at the wrist just as natural hands can but which $40,000 prosthetics can't. Children designed hands that mimic those of comic-book superheroes-- earning the envy of classmates. Professional prosthetics are much more elaborate, but at $40,000 a pop, they aren't practical for growing children. A fashion designer created stunningly beautiful hands for a fellow student. 3-D Printed hands are evolving at breathtaking speed because of what my Mercatus colleague Adam Thierer calls ""permissionless innovation."" No one has to beg permission from anyone to design, modify or distribute hands. That wouldn't be true if the hands included sensors and/or motors or if they were sold, rather than given away. Regulators would likely swoop in, and innovation would slow. Permissionless innovation is largely alien to health care. New drugs, devices and procedures typically wait for years as regulators sort through stacks of proposals and tons of data. The film ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is based on the true story of an AIDS victim, 30 days from death, who was denied lifesaving treatment because the Food and Drug Administration wanted extra years of testing to assure safety and effectiveness. The greatest example of permissionless innovation is the Internet. In the early 1990s, the federal government surrendered control over the Internet and enabled commercial developers to make full use of the system. Once that happened, professionals and amateurs produced software, hardware and apps in ways and at speeds no one could have foreseen. An American of 25 years ago could scarcely believe our world of Google, Siri, GPS, YouTube, Street View, Facebook, Amazon, Bitcoin and Kindle. None of this would have happened had there been a Federal Internet Commission judging each innovation. If you think, ""but health care is different,"" keep in mind that it would have been equally easy in 1989 to demand heavy regulation of a frightening new communication technology. The Internet raises risks of online fraud, sexual predators, coordinated terrorism, identity theft and privacy violations. If such things as OnStar, GM's safety and connectivity system, or hospital connectivity fails, people can die. Somehow, we decided to accept these risks to enjoy the benefits. Health care may change as much by 2039 as consumer electronics did since 1989. We'll likely see 3-D printed transplantable organs, drugs tailor-made to patients' personal DNA, nanobots to repair damaged genes and artificial intelligence to guide people toward wellness. Excessive regulation, however, can bring these processes to a crawl. Adam Thierer says, ""Trying to preemptively plan for every hypothetical worst-case scenario means the best-case scenarios will never come about."" The innovations will happen in Europe, India, Singapore and elsewhere if not here. And to compete, we have to accept some risks and open the door to some outside innovators. No one suggests completely deregulated health care. The question is one of degree and design. Already, Europe surpasses the United States in drug availability, thanks to its more decentralized approval process. We can suggest an Iron Law of Innovation: For better products at lower cost, you must allow reasonable risk-taking (by consumers and producers), and you must allow unknown outsiders to introduce unexpected genius into the process. The printed hand shows us how. The task is to apply its lessons across health care. Talking about innovation will be a lot more fun and incredibly more productive than squabbling over Obamacare.

This is despite his previous use of the word ""miracle"" to describe the weight loss effects of forskolin, raspberry ketones, sea buckthorn, garcinia cambogia, African mango seed and green coffee bean extract. Dr. Oz said his job on the show ""is to be a cheerleader for the audience (when) they don't think they have hope"" But hope is not the same as good advice, and, as Dr. Oz noted, none of these recommendations have proven miraculous. ""Cheerleading"" as described by Dr. Oz has contributed to the creation of a weight loss market that is overwhelmingly ineffective yet highly profitable, with sales at $60 billion per year. The demand is there. Among U.S. adults, 68% are overweight or obese and as many as 100 million are trying to lose weight at any given time. Annually, obesity accounts for about $200 billion, or about 20%, of our health care costs. It costs billions more in worker absenteeism and lost productivity. Over 80% of people who lose 10% or more of their weight will regain it, and for all the new treatments, that number hasn't really improved in a generation. This is not to say that we shouldn't join Dr. Oz in offering hope. We should seek hope by investing in new ideas and more personalized approaches to combating the obesity epidemic rather than by embracing anecdotal ""miracles."" One way is to focus on obesity prevention, which starts in the home, school and community. Numerous studies suggest that the behaviors we learn early in life influence our behavior as adults. (I know that my parents always told me to eat a vegetable with lunch and dinner. To this day, if I am running late for work and just have time to grab a hot dog, I feel a scowling avatar of my mother pop up on my left shoulder). We can potentially delay or even prevent adult diseases by fostering better health habits in our children. Schools are an excellent venue in which to orient families toward healthy behavior. Teachers, in addition to providing health and physical education, can serve as role models and engage parents about good health practices for their children. Unfortunately, most public schools, including those in New York, do not meet their mandates for providing minimal physical education. And in general, there isn't enough focus on good dietary and exercise habits in school-based health initiatives. The need for a multipronged approach utilizing actions in communities, schools, businesses, families and health care providers to prevent obesity has been recognized by many federal programs (such as Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign), state programs (such as New York's), and local programs (such as in Chicago or Los Angeles). Obesity prevention proposals have raised important questions regarding costs and long-term efficacy. It should be noted that some studies have shown that cost-effective, school-based interventions can be implemented, slow weight gain and yield other health benefits such as improved insulin sensitivity or cholesterol level in children. While it has not been determined whether these benefits persist after the program is stopped, the potential financial and health gains as a result of delaying the onset of obesity by even a few years would be huge. We need to start early at home, in classrooms, neighborhoods and even in the pediatrician's office. The risk of a fat child becoming a fat adult is doubled at age 2-3 but over 20-fold after age 9. Behavioral interventions appear more effective if started in early childhood. Exploration of new preventive measures should require detailed assessment of their short- and long-term efficacy so they are adequately vetted before they become policy. We should demand that our schools emphasize life-prep as well as test-prep and that failure of schools to fulfill their physical education obligations is treated with the same severity as failing to meet academic obligations. School lunches should be a part of school education and we must actively oppose efforts to undermine them, such as recent Republican efforts to allow schools to opt out of requirements for more fruits and vegetables in meals -- an improvement that arose from the 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act. Health education is a learning process, and like any academic area, it needs to be developed over time. Good nutrition and exercise habits are good for all of us -- fat or thin -- and most of us could use a refresher course. There is hope, but we have to use common sense and good science to make sure we're on the right path. As Charles Darwin put it, ""the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible do miracles become."""

And when Brian Kelly purchased such a fare -- which usually costs about $11,000 -- using United's online ticketing system last week, he knew that's exactly what it was. But he also knew from first-hand experience that ""error fares"" -- rock-bottom fares mistakenly issued by carriers -- can sometimes be recognized as good for travel by airlines. Having booked two fares at rock-bottom prices on the site, Kelly, who runs an advice website for frequent flyers called The Points Guy, alerted his readers to the ""amazing deal"" on his website, encouraging them to take advantage of the offer before United corrected the glitch -- then waited to see if the ticket would be honored. ""Everyone knew this was a mistake -- a huge one. One of the biggest I've seen an airline make,"" he said. Airlines regularly make errors resulting in mispriced fares being issued, sometimes honoring them but often not. ""I've been on a lot of crazy mistake fares in the past that did work out, the airlines did honor them,"" said Kelly, who recounts how he recently flew round trips from New York to Stockholm and Copenhagen on three consecutive weekends for $138 a trip. See also: 'Hidden' airline charges just dirty tricks? Kelly said he was optimistic that although the fares were clearly issued in error, United would be required to honor the tickets following a recent ruling on ""mistake fares"" by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The rule means that a purchase occurs once the customer pays the full amount -- and that once the purchase is confirmed, whether through an email or credit card transaction or other means, ""then the seller of air transportation cannot increase the price of that air transportation to that consumer, even when the fare is a 'mistake.'"" Kelly had received a confirmation email from the airline, suggesting the fare should be valid under the new rules. But United contacted him and others to tell them that the incorrect fares had been issued due to a ""programming error."" Customers who wished to retain the fares would be charged the full amount, or could cancel the purchase and have any fees waived. United spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said it would have been clear that the fare was a mistake as the correct amount was displayed on the same screen. On website Flyertalk, United said the fact that the correct price was displayed was a ""unique circumstance"" unlike ""other widely reported 'mistake fares.'"" However, for customers who had already begun their travel by the time the glitch was detected, the airline would honor their return fares. The airline would not say how many people booked flights for the incorrect price, or how many actually managed to travel on the cheap fares by commencing their travel before United took action. Kelly said although he ""would have liked the airline to have honored"" the fare, he wasn't going to lose any sleep over missing out. But he said it would have provided a good test case for the Department of Transportation. See also: Fliers pay more for window seats Department of Transportation spokesman Bill Mosley said the department had received 150 complaints from customers who had bought the ""error fares"" and was still determining whether United had violated the rules. ""If we find a carrier violates our rules, we can issue fines and cease-and-desist orders,"" he said. Airline responses to pricing mistakes are unpredictable. In 2010, American Airlines refused to honor first-class return tickets from the U.S. to Australia, worth up to $20,000, it had sold for the coach price of $1,100. But it offered $200 vouchers as compensation. The previous year British Airways also failed to accept $40 flights to India, offering $300 vouchers instead. But in 2008 Swiss International honored some $0 flights booked between Toronto and destinations in Europe and India, while refusing others. Kelly polled his site users and asked them if they thought taking advantage of such mistakes was unethical. While about a quarter thought those who booked the tickets were ""bottom feeders trying to ruin a poor airline,"" he said, the majority was comfortable with opportunistically capitalizing on the mistakes of airlines. What do you think? Would you knowingly book an ""error fare"" with an airline? Or is doing so unethical? Let us know in the comments section below."

Legendary literary agent Ed Victor had just emerged from the shower in his house in upstate New York last summer when his wife Carole pointed to his leg. ‘On the back of my right thigh was a bright bull’s-eye mark – you couldn’t mistake it,’ says Ed. The crimson circle with a ring around it is immediately recognisable to many in America’s Northeast, the telltale first sign of an illness that is  on the rise in Britain: Lyme disease. Ed says: ‘I went right away to an urgent  care surgery near our house, and the doctor took one look and said, ‘‘Classic Lyme disease.’’ ’ The disease comes from a family of bacteria called Borrelia, spread by ticks – small parasitic insects commonly found on animals but which feed on human blood given the chance. They attach for anything from a few hours to weeks, but their bite is painless, so it is often unnoticed. If the disease is transmitted, the potential symptoms are complex and difficult to overcome. And a growing number of British ticks are now carriers.In the early stages symptoms tend to comprise headache, weakness, muscle pain and fever – much like flu. Eighty per cent of sufferers in the first few days develop the bull’s-eye lesion, known as erythema chronicum migrans, or EM. In Europe, our strain of Lyme disease can also cause a purple lump on the ear lobe, scrotum or nipple. But those with EM are at an advantage as it makes diagnosis easier – if a doctor sees the mark. Ed Victor pictured with Nigella Lawson, on of his clients. The literary agent contracted Lyme disease after being bitten by a tick Ed explains: ‘I said to the doctor, “Why don’t you do a blood test?” And he said, “I’ve seen thousands of these bright red circles, and thousands of cases of Lyme disease. You have it.” ’ The blood test for Lyme disease is not wholly reliable. In many cases, without a positive blood test or EM, diagnosis can  be made based on symptoms and likelihood of contact with an infected tick. For many, however, the disease goes unchecked and undiagnosed. In Britain, where Lyme disease is less common or known, studies suggest as many as 90 per cent of carriers don’t know they have it. ‘Cases in the South of England – as well as across Europe – are increasing,’ says consultant microbiologist Dr Matthew Dryden, Britain’s foremost authority on the disease. Dr Matthew Dryden, an expert on Lyme disease said the number of cases in the south of England is on the up ‘This could be because of increased housing in greenfield areas, but could also be due to rising populations of deer and ticks, due to global warming.’ With about 1,000 confirmed, treated cases per year (only 15 per cent from infection overseas), if the proportion of undiagnosed incidents is as many as  90 per cent, then up to 9,000 Britons could be suffering debilitating symptoms with no idea what is causing them and nothing to stop the progress of the disease. As the bacteria spread, symptoms worsen. Dr Dryden says: ‘It affects everyone differently. Some don’t have any symptoms and some, even after successful treatment, have post-infection problems that last for months.’ Alongside the initial flu-like state, exhaustion can set in as well as mental confusion, depression, dizziness and heart palpitations. Then, for about ten to 15 per cent, facial palsy, meningitis which triggers intense headaches and light sensitivity, or encephalitis, which can prompt memory loss, sleep disturbance and mood changes. Finally, after a few months, chronic problems can take hold: paralysis, shooting pains, numbness, amnesia, vertigo, panic attacks, weakness in the legs affecting gait, joint problems, and even psychosis. ‘I was one of the lucky ones,’ says Ed, leaning back on a sofa in his office in Bloomsbury, Central London. ‘I was put  on a two-week, high-dose course of the antibiotic amoxicillin straight away.’ Another antibiotic – doxycycline – is used for Lyme in Britain. But while reassured about his own treatment, Ed, whose clients include Nigella Lawson, Eric Clapton, Rupert Everett and Roman Polanski, was alarmed by what his doctor said next. ‘I told him I was going back to England and he said, “Under no circumstances go to a doctor over there. They understand nothing about it. Just do what I’m telling you and you’ll be fine.” ’ This, combined with the fact that an Irish friend of Ed who contracted Lyme’s ‘went to endless specialist hospitals and no one knew what was wrong with him’, persuaded him to speak out. ‘Many GPs are unfamiliar with it because it’s not very common,’ says Dr Dryden. Ed Victor said: 'I was one of the lucky ones' A couple of days after Ed’s EM appeared, he starting having symptoms. ‘I remember vividly how depressed the disease made me. I’m normally very up, optimistic and enthusiastic. But suddenly I was really low. 'I could feel this melancholia descend on me. But I knew it was the Lyme disease so I told myself, “I’ll get through this.” ’ With the depression came a great loss of energy and an almost constant headache. ‘By the end of the two-week course of antibiotics, the depression lifted but dull headaches continued for a while,’ he says. Dr Dryden adds: ‘Some patients are given a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, or fibromyalgia [chronic, unexplained pain].’ Meanwhile, Ed is determined he won’t be put off spending time in his home in the Hamptons – or from golfing, even though he may have been bitten on the course. ‘I’ve had leukaemia and chemotherapy three times so, for me, Lyme wasn’t nearly as bad as that,’ he says. ‘But I will use insect repellent now.’ One tragic victim of Lyme disease was Lisa Hole, 44, who took her own life to escape 'unbearable' symptoms that had left her needing a wheelchair and sometimes bedbound. Her husband of 15 years, John Mladenovich, 46, also committed suicide after watching Lisa die. He was found at their home in Oxford cradling pictures of Lisa, and at the time of  his death was being investigated for assisting her suicide. Lisa Hole took her own life to escape the 'unbearable' symptoms of Lyme disease It is estimated that up to 17 per cent of the UK tick population carry Lyme disease. Most are in the New Forest, Wiltshire, Exmoor, the South Downs, and the west coast of Scotland, although some infected ticks have been found in London parks. There is currently no drug to prevent Lyme disease. In 2002, a vaccine was introduced in the US but was later withdrawn because of concerns over side effects. Lyme spirochetes, the bacteria which cause the disease The Lancet reported positive results of a new vaccine trial last year but suggested it might not be available for three years. Once someone is bitten and diagnosed treatment involves antibiotics. The best prevention is to avoid a bite - in wooded, forest areas and long grass, wear a long-sleeve shirt, tuck your trousers into your socks and use insect repellent. If you find a tick, remove it by gently gripping it as close to the skin as possible, preferably using fine tweezers and pull it steadily. Never use a lit cigarette end, a match head or essential oils to force out the tick. These can cause the bug to regurgitate its stomach contents, causing infection."

Rio Smedley was just two years old when he was beaten to death by Daniel Rigby in April, 2012. Just a few weeks earlier, Rigby had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting Rio’s pregnant mum Kirsty Smedley but the case was dropped. Today the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled that, although the death could not have been prevented, the investigation into the assault had been plagued by errors. One PC failed to check if CCTV existed of the pair walking near her home in Bolton after the assault. He also failed to check if neighbours or other witnesses had seen anything suspicious. The officer failed to question Rigby about his criminal history, make enquiries about Rio or pass on information about his mother’s injuries. The IPCC say the PC should now face disciplinary action. Rigby, of Dorset Avenue, Tyldesley, was jailed for life in 2012 for murder after carrying out the horrific attack while Smedley was out buying him cannabis. Smedley, from Bolton, was found guilty of allowing or causing the death of the child at her home in Cheriton Drive, Breightmet, Bolton and was jailed for four years. She claimed her son had fallen down the stairs but analysis of the injuries showed that was a lie.His liver had split in two and he had suffered 91 separate injuries. Just a few weeks before Rio's death Daniel Rigby (right) had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting Rio’s pregnant mum Kirsty Smedley (left) Rigby had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting Rio¿s pregnant mum Kirsty Smedley but the case was dropped The criticised PC and another officer, a sergeant, have already been subject to ‘management action’ by GMP over the way they reviewed the assault allegation before the decision was made to take no further action. IPCC Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: 'While it cannot be said that if the officers had chosen to take a different course of action against Daniel Rigby Rio Smedley would still be alive today, there were a number of shortcomings identified during our investigation. 'Reports of domestic violence must be treated seriously and acted upon thoroughly, particularly those that involve children who may themselves be at risk.'"

A worried member of the public called police after hearing the muffled shouting coming from near a disused coppermine in woods above the Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire. Police sent a specialist dog handler and a team of officers to investigate while mountain rescue teams were also called in. Search: A team of 20 police officers spent eight-and-a-half hours scouring woodland after a dog walker heard cries of 'help!' - which were actually from a woman shouting for her dog Yelp Emergency search: Police were told within half an hour that a dog walker had been shouting at her pet in the area - but they carried on searching for a further eight hours anyway Officers spent eight-and-a-half hours combing a small area of woodland yesterday searching for the 'trapped' woman. But last night they were forced to call off their search after realising the cries were almost certainly a dog walker shouting the name of her pet. Officers arrived on the scene at around 8am yesterday, and 'fairly quickly' established that another woman regularly exercised her dog in the area. She was contacted at around 8.30 am, and confirmed that she had been in the area, and had indeed been shouting for her pet. However, half an hour later, just as this was beginning to look like the explanation, police received further calls from two more people, insisting they had again heard a woman's voice shouting 'help'. Police eventually abandoned the search shortly after 5pm last night after finding no evidence of an emergency. Hunt: The search went on in in woods above the Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, yesterday A police spokesman said they were confident they had carefully searched the area, and had done all that could be done. Inspector Pat Scroggie, who led the operation, said the search had been treated as 'precautionary'. He said: 'We had teams search the hills accompanied with search dogs. 'We are very well versed in this type of thing. We are carried out systematic searches of all sections of the hill.' The Bridge of Allan coppermine was used intermittently from the 16th century until the early part of the 20th century. Probe: Three separate members of the public told police they thought they had heard cries of 'help!' yesterday At one time, copper from the mine was used in the mint at Stirling Castle. No actual shafts exist, because the copper was extracted by drift mining techniques. The area above Mine Woods, Bridge of Allan, was the focus of extensive searches earlier in the year, after Stirling University mathematics student David O'Halloran, 18, went missing in January.

Rather than quizzing scientific knowledge, the survey asked people to rate their confidence in several statements about science and medicine. On some, there's broad acceptance. Just 4 percent doubt that smoking causes cancer, 6 percent question whether mental illness is a medical condition that affects the brain and 8 percent are skeptical there's a genetic code inside our cells. More — 15 percent — have doubts about the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccines. Few Americans question that smoking causes cancer. But they express bigger doubts as concepts that scientists consider to be truths get further from our own experiences and the present time About 4 in 10 say they are not too confident or outright disbelieve that the earth is warming, mostly a result of man-made heat-trapping gases, that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old or that life on Earth evolved through a process of natural selection, though most were at least somewhat confident in each of those concepts. But a narrow majority — 51 percent — questions the Big Bang theory. Those results depress and upset some of America's top scientists, including several Nobel Prize winners, who vouched for the science in the statements tested, calling them settled scientific facts. 'Science ignorance is pervasive in our society, and these attitudes are reinforced when some of our leaders are openly antagonistic to established facts,' said 2013 Nobel Prize in medicine winner Randy Schekman of the University of California, Berkeley. The poll highlights 'the iron triangle of science, religion and politics,' said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. And scientists know they've got the shakiest leg in the triangle. To the public 'most often values and beliefs trump science' when they conflict, said Alan Leshner, chief executive of the world's largest scientific society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Political values were closely tied to views on science in the poll, with Democrats more apt than Republicans to express confidence in evolution, the Big Bang, the age of the Earth and climate change. Confidence in evolution, the Big Bang, the age of the Earth and climate change decline sharply as faith in a supreme being rises, according to the poll. Likewise, those who regularly attend religious services or are evangelical Christians express much greater doubts about scientific concepts they may see as contradictory to their faith. 'When you are putting up facts against faith, facts can't argue against faith,' said 2012 Nobel Prize winning biochemistry professor Robert Lefkowitz of Duke University. 'It makes sense now that science would have made no headway because faith is untestable.' But evolution, the age of the Earth and the Big Bang are all compatible with God, except to Bible literalists, said Francisco Ayala, a former priest and professor of biology, philosophy and logic at the University of California, Irvine. And Darrel Falk, a biology professor at Point Loma Nazarene University and an evangelical Christian, agreed, adding: 'The story of the cosmos and the Big Bang of creation is not inconsistent with the message of Genesis 1, and there is much profound biblical scholarship to demonstrate this.' In addition to disbelief in the Big Bang, a high amount of Americans also doubt that earth is over 4.5 billion years old Beyond religious belief, views on science may be tied to what we see with our own eyes. The closer an issue is to our bodies and the less complicated, the easier it is for people to believe, said John Staudenmaier, a Jesuit priest and historian of technology at the University of Detroit Mercy. Marsha Brooks, a 59-year-old nanny who lives in Washington, D.C., said she's certain smoking causes cancer because she saw her mother, aunts and uncles, all smokers, die of cancer. But when it comes to the universe beginning with a Big Bang or the Earth being about 4.5 billion years old, she has doubts. She explained: 'It could be a lack of knowledge. It seems so far' away. Jorge Delarosa, a 39-year-old architect from Bridgewater, N.J., pointed to a warm 2012 without a winter and said, 'I feel the change. There must be a reason.' But when it came to Earth's beginnings 4.5 billion years ago, he has doubts simply because 'I wasn't there.' Experience and faith aren't the only things affecting people's views on science. Duke University's Lefkowitz sees 'the force of concerted campaigns to discredit scientific fact' as a more striking factor, citing significant interest groups — political, business and religious — campaigning against scientific truths on vaccines, climate change and evolution. Yale's Leiserowitz agreed but noted sometimes science wins out even against well-financed and loud opposition, as with smoking. Widespread belief that smoking causes cancer 'has come about because of very public, very focused public health campaigns,' AAAS's Leshner said. A former acting director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Leshner said he was encouraged by the public's acceptance that mental illness is a brain disease, something few believed 25 years ago, before just such a campaign. That gives Leiserowitz hope for a greater public acceptance of climate change. But he fears it may be too late to do anything about it. The AP-GfK Poll was conducted March 20-24, 2014, using KnowledgePanel, GfK's probability-based online panel designed to be representative of the U.S. population. It involved online interviews with 1,012 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points for all respondents. Respondents were first selected randomly using phone or mail survey methods and were later interviewed online. People selected for KnowledgePanel who didn't otherwise have access to the Internet were provided with the ability to access the Internet at no cost to them."

In a letter posted on the court's website Wednesday, President Alassane Ouattara asked for an ""independent and impartial investigations into the most serious crimes committed"" after the presidential poll. Ouattara has been in power since the April arrest of incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo, who defied international calls to step down after he lost the election. Hundreds died in the ensuing standoff, according to rights groups. Human rights investigators said this month that they have found a total of 10 mass graves near the commercial capital of Abidjan. Human Rights Watch has said forces loyal to both leaders killed or raped citizens, burned homes and kidnapped civilians during the standoff. The president asked the international court to ensure those with the ""greatest criminal responsibility"" for the crimes are brought to justice. He made the request in a letter to Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo this month, the court said. Perpetrators will be brought to justice, according to the international court based in The Hague, Netherlands. ""Since the upsurge of violence following the second-round of the presidential election ... the office of the prosecutor has carefully examined all crime allegations and repeatedly reminded the political and military leaders of Cote d'Ivoire that the most serious crimes falling under the court's jurisdiction will not remain unpunished,"" the court said in a statement. On Monday, the criminal court sought the arrest of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and two relatives, linking them to ""widespread and systematic"" attacks on civilians as they struggle to hold power in the North African nation. And the court has accused two prominent Kenyan politicians -- Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta and member of Parliament William Ruto -- and four others of multiple counts of crimes against humanity for the bloody post-election violence that wracked Kenya in late 2007 and early 2008."

You answer it and find a long-dead loved one at your front door, apparently come back to life and looking just the same as the day they died. How would you react? That's the idea behind Jason Mott's debut novel, ""The Returned."" In the hands of an author such as Stephen King or Dean Koontz, this could be the start of something scary, but this is no zombie tale. Inspired by a dream in which his late mother visits him, Mott tells a personal story about one family caught up in a worldwide event. ""The Returned"" is set in a small Mississippi town and focuses on an elderly couple, Harold and Lucille Hargraves. A government agent shows up at their home with the couple's son, who drowned on his eighth birthday 50 years ago. Jacob looks and acts the same but how could this be the Hargraves' son? Obviously, the couple is much older and has tried to move on. How will this little boy fit into their lives now or be accepted in their community? Jacob is one of thousands being reunited with families all over the world. Initially there's elation, then fear and eventually hysteria. Are these ""Returned"" a miracle or a sign of the end times? Mott was almost unknown before ""The Returned,"" but critics and advance readers are calling his first novel ""eloquent"" and ""elegiac,"" also ""haunting"" and ""heart wrenching."" Brad Pitt's ""Plan B"" entertainment snapped up the rights and is already shooting a TV series based on the novel. Entertainment Weekly recently listed him as one of their 10 ""New Hollywood: Next Wave"" people to watch. As his first novel hits shelves, Mott, who lives in rural North Carolina, says he's terrified and excited by his newfound fame. Fast facts: Jason Mott Age: 35 Hometown: Born and raised in Bolton, North Carolina, a small town of less than 700 people and one traffic light in the eastern part of the state near the coast. For fans of: Magical realism, British author Neil Gaiman and readers who enjoyed Stephen King's ""The Green Mile."" What else he has written: Mott is the author of two previous poetry collections, ""We Call This Thing Between Us Love"" and ""...hide behind me..."" Before he was a novelist: Mott worked for several years as a customer service representative for Verizon Wireless, fielding complaints in New York from angry customers. Five questions with Jason Mott CNN: What was the idea behind ""The Returned?"" Mott: It actually started with a dream I had about my mother. Both of my parents have passed away, my mother in 2001 and my father in 2007. In the summer of 2010, I had this dream that I came home from work one day and found my mother sitting at the kitchen table waiting for me. I came in and sat down with her, and we just talked about everything that had happened since her death. My going to college, friends that I'd met, it was this warm kind of cathartic dream where I was able to be with my mother again for the first time in almost a decade. It was one of these really vivid dreams where you wake up and question whether it was real or not. I really expected to find her sitting on the couch when I came out of my bedroom but of course she wasn't. That dream stuck with me, I couldn't get it out of my head. I was talking to a friend of mine who's also a writer and we discussed it, at some point in the conversation he said: What if that really happened and what if it wasn't just her? I wrote a short story not long after about a couple whose son returns. I did a reading and the crowd really seemed to respond to it. People came up afterward and said how it reminded them of people they had lost. So after seeing that strong reaction, I started writing and about a year later, I had a manuscript on my hands. It's still kind of hard to believe how it all happened, but it's been a lot of fun and I feel really special about it. CNN: This could have been a horror story, but you took a much different approach. Why? Mott: I tried to make the story as grounded as I could because I felt it was such a difficult topic to approach. When I was working on the manuscript I talked to a lot of my friends, their parents, people that I knew, asking them what they would do if someone they loved who had passed away suddenly showed up again. The responses were really interesting. Usually people were very excited to hear about it, saying they would love to have so and so back, that it would be a really wonderful moment. Then I would follow up with what would happen a year later, is it still just as exciting and wonderful? Sometimes the answers became really complicated. You had people who had changed dramatically since their loved one had passed away. I'm not the same person as I was when my mother passed in 2001. I was 22 years old then, now I'm a 35-year-old adult. It's two completely different mindsets. So as much as I love her still, I'm much different now and that could create some friction. There were other people who had similar answers who had moved forward in life. That was the thing I tried most to carry into the novel, to be as realistic as possible. CNN: What's behind the recent fascination in books, TV and movies with the undead? Mott: It's the ultimate mystery: What happens after we die? If people are coming back, what does that mean to our beliefs? The whole genre revolves around that idea as well as the emotional impact of someone you've let go of suddenly thrust back into the equation. So how do you react to it? On a national level and on a personal level, I think it's everyone really trying to understand life and who they are versus people who have passed away. I think there's a lot of self-exploration going on right now. CNN: Your book is now being turned into a TV series. How is that going? Mott: It's going really well. I don't have much direct involvement, which I'm actually very glad about since things are so busy right now. I made a deal with Plan B, Brad Pitt's film company, and they brought in a wonderful writer, Aaron Zelman, who worked on AMC's ""The Killing,"" and they're doing a great job. They're filming outside Atlanta right now. I've had a chance to meet the cast, and they're all really excited. I had a chance to see the pilot, and I like what they're doing with it. It's a little bit surreal, seeing the actors playing these characters who've I had close to my heart. It's like being outside of yourself for a moment. It's almost like sending a child out into the world. It's been fascinating, fun and a little bit scary at times. With all authors when you option the rights to your work, there's a little bit of nervousness over what will happen to it, how will it come out? But once I saw the pilot, it was so well-done, I'm really excited about it. CNN: What kind of response have you had from people who've read the book? Mott: Many of them will come up to me and talk about someone they lost that this reminded them of. Once they finished the book, they got a photo album out and looked at photos they hadn't thought about in a long time because the book really made them remember that person and brought to the forefront all the good times they had with that person. To me, this is the most rewarding part. That's what I wanted the book to do. It came from a very personal place for me, so I wanted the readers to have a personal experience as well. I didn't want it to be just my story. I also wanted it to remind you to really value the time you have with someone who's here now and realize how precious this time is. If the book can do that for anyone, then I'm happy with it."

The Health Secretary will tell the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to work with cancer charities and researchers. He will also announce a 40 per cent rise in resources to pay for vital treatments blocked by NICE. He is to increase the Cancer Drugs Fund from £200million to £280million for the next two years to improve access to drugs currently deemed too expensive. NICE has been ordered to review its system for approving drugs following complaints that it bases its trials solely on patients with no other underlying health conditions. It is being asked to include evidence from patients with other conditions, a move that could see more drugs being approved. Health chiefs have been told to renegotiate with the drugs industry to drive down the price of cancer treatments. ‘It’s vitally important that as many people as possible have access to these pioneering, life-enhancing drugs,’ said Mr Hunt, adding that the fund ‘has an essential role in helping us realise our ambition to be the best place in Europe to survive cancer’. Two more drugs have been approved for immediate inclusion on the Cancer Drugs Fund list as a result of today’s decision. The first is Xtandi, a drug for treating advanced prostate cancer. The second is Revlimid, which will become available for patients with the rare blood condition myelodysplastic syndrome for the first time. Officials will also now review the list of drugs approved by the fund ‘to ensure patients are offered the most effective drugs for their condition and [so that] new drugs can be added to the list’. The Cancer Drugs Fund was established in April 2011 following a public outcry at decisions by NICE to block certain treatments on cost grounds. It is credited with helping more than 55,000 cancer patients by paying for costly drugs that would not otherwise have been provided on the NHS. But critics complain it is little more than a sticking plaster and are pressing for fundamental reform of NICE. The organisation, which is responsible for deciding which drugs are made available on the NHS, is blamed by some for unfairly blocking drugs it deems to be poor value for money. Xtandi, a drug designed to fight prostate cancer (pictured), has already been approved under the new rules. Mr Hunt will also increase the Cancer Drugs Fund from £200million to £280million for the next two years NICE says it makes no sense to fund drugs that can extend life for a few weeks or months but cost tens of thousands of pounds per patient, when the money could be better spent on other treatments. But critics point out that it rejects almost two-thirds of the cancer treatments it assesses – meaning that patients in England are denied drugs that are available in other parts of the world. NICE came under fire earlier this month when it rejected the drug Kadcyla, which can extend life for women with an aggressive form of breast cancer for six months, but which costs £90,000 per patient. The Department of Health last night said the drug was available via the Cancer Drugs Fund, and that funding for the scheme has been guaranteed until at least 2016. Cancer charities welcomed the increased funding and said a thorough review was vital. Mark Flannagan, chief executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ‘The current system of pricing and approving drugs is broken and is letting down cancer patients. ‘NICE and the pharmaceutical industry must show greater flexibility and a genuine willingness to work together in the interests of all cancer patients.’ Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, described the funding increase and review as ‘an important start’ in ensuring the Cancer Drugs Fund is sustainable in the long-term. Chris Askew, chief executive of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, also welcomed the news, but warned that several ‘innovative, effective drugs’ are still ‘sitting on the shelf of no use to anybody’."

The beds will soon be joined by 11,000 sofas and even 5,000 toilet brushes, say organizers. The Summer Games run from July 27 through August 12. Olympic Village, a huge housing complex of some 2,800 apartments within walking distance of the stadium in East London, has already been sold as part of the post-games legacy plans. Nearly 1,400 of the apartments were sold in 2009 for $400 million and will be rented by local governments for subsidized housing. The remainder was sold to a consortium, including the Qatari government, as part of a $800 million deal to own and manage the entire village. Local campaigners have pushed for more of the apartments to be social housing as part of the organizer's pledge to regenerate the area post-games. The original plan was for the developer Lend Lease to raise the funding privately to build the village, but the work started in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. The government decided instead to the foot the reported $1.6 billion bill and is unlikely to recoup the entire cost of the housing. The complex will be known as East Village once it is turned over to renters and homeowners."

President Richard Nixon smiles and waves to a supporter in Washington in January 1973. The recordings, encompassing almost 1,000 conversations in January and February of 1973, cover a range of topics, including, among other things, the conclusion of the Vietnam Paris peace talks, the Supreme Court's controversial Roe v. Wade abortion rights ruling, the death of former President Lyndon Johnson, and a rapidly metastasizing Watergate scandal. They show President Richard Nixon at both his best -- delving into the intricacies of Cold War diplomacy -- and his worst, plotting against his perceived political enemies in the media and elsewhere. Still basking in the afterglow of a landslide 49-state reelection in 1972, Nixon at one point tells aide Charles Colson that he wants nothing to do with those who would advise reaching out to critics in order to try and unify the country. ""Those people that wanted me to have [an] 'era of good feelings' ... Somebody wrote me a memorandum about that and I told [White House Chief of Staff H.R.] Haldeman if anyone ever showed me that again I'm gonna flush them down the goddamn john,"" Nixon says. ""You should,"" Colson replies. At another point, Nixon tells then-Republican National Committee Chairman George H.W. Bush that the GOP can further boost its electoral fortunes by recruiting ""attractive"" women to run for office. Recounting a recent visit to the South Carolina state legislature, Nixon tells Bush that he ""noticed a couple of very attractive women, both of them Republicans. ... I want you to be sure to emphasize to our people, God, let's look for some. ... Understand, I don't do it because I'm for women, but I'm doing it because I think maybe a woman might win someplace where a man might not. ... So have you got that in mind?"" Bush replies that he'll ""certainly keep it in mind."" Nixon also indicates a deep distrust of his senior Cabinet officers, telling Colson on January 5, 1973, to start keeping a detailed log of phone calls made by then-National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger. ""Incidentally, I want it on his private phone too,"" Nixon tells Colson. ""We can get that, can't we?"" Colson then replies that he thinks it can be done. ""Sure, goddamn it. We can get it through the FBI,"" Nixon replies. ""The FBI is to get, to keep the log, on his phone. That's all we want to know, who the hell he calls."" The tapes often show Nixon with a penchant for fixating on even the smallest political disruptions. On January 20, 1973 -- the day of his second inauguration -- Nixon calls a Secret Service agent to say he ""saw the incident where some kid tried to rush the car... I want to be sure they file a charge against him [and don't] just let him go."" The agent assures Nixon that the protester has been put in custody and that a charge has been filed.

But he was jailed for three years and two months after a judge heard that he took a girl to a hotel where they spent the night and he sexually abused her. Gordon's double life was revealed this week at a disciplinary hearing which banned him from working as a nurse. He admitted three offences relating to sexual activity with a child under 16, grooming of a child for the purposes of sexual activity and possession of indecent images relating to children when he appeared at Reading Crown Court earlier this year. He has now been struck off the Nursing and Midwifery Council's register after the panel concluded his fitness to practice had been impaired. An investigation into his crimes by Thames Valley Police found no evidence he had carried out any criminal activity at his work. The 14-year-old involved was not a patient at the hospital. Gordon, formerly of Brighton, was sacked by Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust immediately after his arrest. He was not present at the conduct and competence committee meeting of the Nursing and Midwifery Council on Friday. The panel heard he is a prisoner at Bullingdon prison in Bicester, Oxfordshire. The panel concluded: 'Mr Gordon's actions were significant departures from the standards expected of a registered nurse and are fundamentally incompatible with him remaining on the register. Gordon, who was working at the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton (pictured) at the time the offences were committed, has now been struck off the nursing register by the Nursing and Midwifery Council 'The panel was of the view that the findings in this particular case demonstrate that Mr Gordon's actions were serious and to allow him to continue practising would undermine public confidence in the profession and in the Nursing and Midwifery Council as a regulatory body.' Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Chief executive Matthew Kershaw said: 'As soon as we received news of the charges against him we dismissed him from our employment. 'The police found absolutely no evidence or even suggestion that Graeme Gordon's offending behaviour involved his place of work. 'They also found no evidence that any of his colleagues were aware of his offending behaviour, they received no complaints about his work and there was no history or suggestion of previous offences. 'At the time of his arrest we informed all the appropriate authorities.'"

Boruch Spiegel, who is believed to have given the signal to launch the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943, was described by his son Julius as a 'reluctant hero', following his death in Montreal. Mr Spiegel was among 750 Jews who managed to hold off heavily armed German soldiers for more than a month as they tried to storm the Polish ghetto, intent on transporting its occupants to Nazi death camps. 'Reluctant hero': Boruch Spiegel, seen in a family photograph taken in the 1970s or 1980s, fought the Nazis during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943 With Mr Spiegel's death on May 9, the tiny group of survivors of the legendary World War II revolt that was crushed 70 years ago this month grows even smaller. The then 23-year-old was one of about 750 Jewish fighters who on April 19, 1943, launched an uprising that took the Germans off guard. The fighters were overwhelmingly outnumbered and outgunned and the revolt never had a real chance of victory, but the determined insurgents still managed to hold out for a month - longer than some countries invaded by Hitler. 'Modest': Boruch Spiegel, seen before the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, escaped the ghetto through the sewers along with his future wife as the Germans began to crush the rebellion 'He was very modest, a reluctant hero,' his son Julius Spiegel said of his father. 'He was given an opportunity and he took it. I don’t think he was braver or more resourceful than anyone else.' By the end of May German forces had crushed the uprising, by which time Mr Spiegel had escaped the ghetto through the sewers along with a few dozen other fighters - among them his future wife, Chaika Belchatowska. They trawled through underground sewage canals to reach the so-called 'Aryan side' of the Polish capital. Those left behind were sent to death camps such as Treblinka, where most died. Their struggle endures as a symbol of resistance against the odds and a desire to maintain human dignity in the worst of possible conditions. Ultimately, though, the German revenge was brutal; the Warsaw Ghetto was systematically burned down building by building, culminating in the demolition of the Great Synagogue of Warsaw. After surviving the ghetto uprising, Mr Spiegel and his future wife joined the Polish partisans and also took part in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, a larger city-wide revolt against the occupying Germans. 'He was essentially an ordinary guy forced by circumstances to do things that were out of character,' Julius Spiegel said. Born in October 1919, Mr Spiegel grew up in Warsaw, the son of an Orthodox woman and a leather worker father, according to a New York Times report. After the Germans invaded in 1939, Mr Spiegel and his brother Beryl became involved in the Bundist underground. The Spiegel family managed to hold out for a period as Jewish families were deported around them, thanks to a steel door on their apartment, but his father died of malnutrition and his mother, two sisters, and brother Beryl died in a manner he never learned. Mr Spiegel himself was once taken to the staging area for the Treblinka camp, but managed to escape and return to the ghetto, the report said. Even after the Germans crushed the 1943 uprising, Mr Spiegel fought with Partisans before returning to Warsaw to fight with Poles in a further revolt from August to September 1944. Warsaw was liberated in January 1945. The Spiegels moved to Canada in 1948, where Mr Spiegel followed in the footsteps of his father by working in the leather industry, eventually establishing his own factory. Resistance: Fire breaks out on a city street during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in 1943 Crushed: German troops stand over a group of Jews captured in a basement in the ghetto in May 1943 It's not clear how many of the Warsaw Ghetto fighters are still living, but the number is certainly small. When Poland held national ceremonies last month marking the 70th anniversary of the start of the ghetto uprising, officials in Warsaw said they believed there could be four survivors left. Only one, Simha Rotem, was visibly present at the ceremony, giving a speech and accepting a high state honor from the Polish president. However, Havi Dreifuss, a historian and Holocaust expert with Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem, the Jerusalem-based Holocaust research institution and museum, warned against trying to put a number on how many fighters remain, in part because it's sometimes hard to distinguish fighters from other resisters. She noted that aside from those with weapons, there were others who were entrenched in hiding places and refused to obey Nazi orders to show up for transportations to labor or concentration camps, and that an appreciation has grown over time for their resistance during the uprising. Borech Spiegel is survived by his son, Julius, a retired parks commissioner for Brooklyn, daughter Mindy Spiegel of Montreal, and four grandchildren. His wife died in 2002. During the Second World War as many as 400,000 Polish Jews were crammed into the confines of the Warsaw Ghetto. Within its walls they lived under the shadow of rampant disease and starvation, even before German troops began transporting Jews en masse to the Treblinka extermination camp. The seeds were sown for the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in January 1943, when German soldiers arriving to implement a second deportation of Jews to the camp were met by Jewish resistance fighters who engaged them in clashes. Battle of honour: A Jewish rebel is seen leaving a house surrounded by German soldiers inside the Warsaw Ghetto, during the uprising that peaked during April and May 1943 The deportation was halted after a period of days and only saw 5,000 - rather than the intended 7,000 - Jews taken away. The occupants of the ghetto were ready to fight what was regarded as a battle of honour for the Jewish people, led by two resistance organisations; the ZZW and the ZOB. On 19 April 1943 the police and SS auxiliary forces entered the ghetto for a further deportation action intended to last three days. They were ambushed by Jewish insurgents firing and tossing Molotov cocktails and hand grenades from alleyways, sewers, and windows. The Germans suffered casualties and their advance was halted. German forces resorted to systematically burning down the ghetto, building by building, prompting thousands of surviving Jews and fighters to take cover in underground bunkers or the sewer system. Many were forced out of their hiding places by troops who dropped in smoke bombs. On May 8, the Germans discovered a large dugout located at Miła 18 Street, which served as ŻOB's main command post. Most of the organisation's remaining leadership and dozens of others committed a mass suicide by ingesting cyanide. The suppression of the uprising officially ended on 16 May 1943, with the demolition of the Great Synagogue of Warsaw."

Father-of-two Victorino Chua, 46, was questioned by murder squad detectives for almost four days after being arrested last January over alleged tampering with medical records at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester. He was freed without charge and bailed but was ordered by police to live at a different address due to fears for his personal safety. No more hiding: Father of two Victorino Chua, 46, returns to his terraced house two months before he is due to be questioned over the scandal His £105,000 two-up-two-down terraced home in Heaton Norris, Stockport, was boarded up amid fears it might be targeted by a vigilantes whilst Chua went to a secret address with his wife and two children. But Chua has now returned to the address with his wife after workmen were called out to remove the boards. The move comes just two months before he is due to answer his bail and face further questioning over the scandal. Today, Chua arrived at his home holding two bags of shopping. He emerged from the property just moments later to dump a child’s pram with a passing scrap metal dealer but declined to comment on the investigation. A neighbour said: 'Vic had not been back to the house, which was hardly surprising given all the worries there may have been that he and his home could be a target for revenge attacks. 'But we were equally stunned to see him back on the street. We hear he is protesting his innocence and no doubt moving back home is all part of his battle to clear his name. 'Everyone can understand why he has wanted to keep a low profile but we can only assume he feels there is no point hiding himself away anymore.' Chua was initially detained in a dawn raid on his home on Thursday January 5 and accused of administering a noxious substance. Unafraid: Chua is on bail after being arrested over the alleged tampering of medical records at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport Nurses first discovered a chart for another patient had been altered between January 2 and 3 this year. As a result, it is believed one patient was administered more medication than necessary and had to be carefully monitored by hospital staff before being discharged. Police were granted a warrant of further detention to continue questioning Chua on the allegations for a further 36 hours but decided to rearrest him on suspicion of murder. 'Poisoned patients': The male nurse was questioned by murder squad detectives over the deaths of several people who were given contaminated saline solutions He was quizzed over the deaths of secretary Tracey Arden, 44, retired newspaper photographer Arnold Lancaster, 71, and retired electronics engineer Derek Weaver, 83, who all died after being given contaminated saline solutions. He was also arrested on suspicion of intending to cause grievous bodily harm to 18 other patients including retired journalist Bill Dickson, 82, who passed away on New Year's Eve after being poisoned during the summer. Other deaths being probed are those of NHS office administrator Linda McDonagh, 60 and John 'Jack' Beeley, 73 and Beryl Hope, 70. Seven deaths in total have been linked to an insulin poisoner at the hospital. In total 22 patients are thought to have been deliberately poisoned on wards A1, A2 or A3 - which care for seriously ill patients - between June 1 and July 15 last year. The alarm was first raised nearly two weeks after the spate began, when hospital staff realised a higher than normal number of patients had been reported as having ‘unexplained’ low blood sugar levels. Police have described the investigation as very complex - and are having to examine 700 people who could have contaminated saline fluid. Chua was bailed in relation to all matters pending further inquiries and cannot return to work. Police said further medical and forensic tests are being carried out. Chua - described as a 'doting family man' - has worked at the hospital for two years having moved to England with his wife Marianne, 38, and their two children from the Phillippines about nine years ago. He has been registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council since August 2003 and previously worked at a nursing home. Last year nurse Rebecca Leighton, 27, spent six weeks in jail accused of poisoning the same patients. She was accused of injecting saline solutions with insulin on the wards between 1 June 2011 and 15 July 2011 and was kept in custody due to fears over her safety. But she was dramatically released last September when charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."

Matthew Green, 42, was the first Briton to be discharged from hospital with a completely artificial heart. It meant the pharmaceutical consultant had to carry around a rucksack containing a battery-powered pump attached by tubes to his chest everywhere he went. Life-saving: Matthew Green was the first person in the UK to receive a total artificial heart implant and be able to go home thanks to a portable pump, right Cutting-edge technology: Matthew leaving Papworth Hospital, Cambridge with son Dylan and wife Gill, seen carrying his heart pump The pioneering operation was his only hope of surviving after he was hours from death through pressures on his fatally diseased organ. But now after almost two years, he has received a donor heart and is recovering in hospital. Mr Green, who lives with his wife Gill and seven-year-old son Dylan in London, said he has been granted a ‘third lease of life’. Speaking from Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire where he is expected to be discharged soon, he said: ‘I feel incredibly lucky that I have been given a third lease of life as a result of my heart transplant. ‘It’s hard to put into words the gratitude I feel to my donor and their family. They have helped me turn my life around again. Pioneering: Matthew's rucksack allowed him to leave the house for three-hour periods at a time Innovative: Papworth Hospital, Cambridge is the UK's leading heart and lung transplant centre and fitted Matthew's artificial heart in a £100,000 operation Miraculous: The device Matthew used is generally in service for around three years, during which it beat more than 200million times ‘I want to thank all the amazing staff at Papworth Hospital who have cared for me and I want to urge anyone who is thinking of registering on the NHS organ donor register to do it.’ Mr Green had been in a critical condition after the main chambers of his heart failed and no suitable donors could be found in July 2011. With his health deteriorating fast, specialist surgeons at Papworth decided to fit him with the device in a £100,000 operation. Some parts of the Total Artificial Heart have a 50-year working life, although patients are generally expected to use it for up to two years - during which it will ‘beat’ more than 200million times. The rucksack contained a 14-pound battery powered pump that allowed him to leave the house for three-hour periods at a time. It costs £20,000-a-year to maintain. Its US makers warn that using it more than two years because of the risk of blood clots building up. Dr Denton Cooley implanted the first experimental device in Haskell Carp at St Luke's Hospital in Houston in 1969. The patient died three days later.Following animal testing in the 1970s, the next operation took place in 1982 when the Jarvik 7artificial heart was transplanted into a dentist called Barney Clark. 198 operations followed.By 2001 the first completely self-contained total artificial heart was implanted in Robert Tools at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville.And in 2008, Charles Okeke was implanted with the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart, becoming the the first patient to leave hospital with an artificial heart in May 2010.Since then the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart has been used in more than 900 implants in 65 hospitals. There had been trouble finding a heart donor large enough to power Mr Green’s 6ft3in frame, but one was found last month - just before the two-year period ended. It means Mr Green has the record for the longest time living outside of hospital with a completely artificial heart. Steven Tsui, clinical director of transplant services at Papworth, said: ‘I am delighted that we were able to find a suitable donor heart for Matthew to have a heart transplant and I expect him to go home very soon.’ Before the initial operation to fit an artificial heart, Mr Green spoke of how the external pump would transform his life. He was diagnosed with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that can cause arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The exact cause of the condition - the second most common reason for sudden death in the young - is unknown, although it appears to be passed on genetically. He said in 2011: ‘It feels very different - before the operation my heartbeat was very weak and I could hardly feel my pulse. Now it’s a very strong heartbeat. ‘Two years ago I was cycling nine miles to work and nine miles back every day but by the time I was admitted to hospital I was struggling to walk even a few yards. 'I am really excited about going home and just being able to do the everyday things that I haven’t been able to do for such a long time - such as playing in the garden with my son and cooking a meal for my family.’ There are 214 people waiting for donor hearts in Britain, 15 of whom are children. Many more are not even put on the transplant list because their chances of surviving are so slim."

The Vlaams Belang political party made the 250 euros (£200) offer today in the wake of face veil riots in Brussels. Filip Dewinter, a senior figure within the right-wing party, told Reuters the riots had made police apprehensive about enforcing the burqa ban. He claimed that the payment should put pressure on authorities to further enforce it. Mr Dewinter said: 'It's a textile prison for the women who have to live under it.' The anti-immigration nationalist party's stunt follows protesters hurling bins and metal barriers at a Brussels police station last week. The riot broke out after a Muslim woman was arrested for refusing to remove her face veil, or niqab. A Brussels police spokesman said he was unaware of the money being offered. But added that any officer who sees a woman wearing a niqab would issue a penalty. He said: 'When someone is breaking the law we always have to intervene, demonstrations or no, the niqab is prohibited.' Women in Belgium risk a maximum fine of 150 euros (£120) if they wear a full face veil in public. Mr Dewinter said he was not aware how many people had already responded to the offer of a bounty. A spokeswoman for Belgium's federal police said the legality of the bounty was a question for the judiciary, but if someone felt insulted by it they could file a complaint with the police. Police in Belgium are investigating last week's riots and arrested 13 members of the Islamist group Sharia4Belgium on Sunday, the police spokesman said. Fines: A right wing party in Belgium is encouraging people to report Muslim woman wearing traditional burqa or niqab face coverings to the police, so the ban on their use can be enforced Sharia4Belgium was not immediately available for comment. Belgium and France both banned the wearing of full veils in public last year. Nicolas Sarkozy, who was French president when the ban was brought in,  had commented that the outfits oppress women were 'not welcome' in France. Canada announced in December that new citizens had to remove any face coverings, including the niqab and burqa, when they take the oath of citizenship."

Lawyers working on behalf of Jesse Friedman, whose conviction was highlighted in the 2003 Oscar-nominated documentary 'Capturing the Friedmans,' want to review grand jury testimony and transcripts of witness interviews. 'Every aspect, every part, every piece of paper generated in the matter of People V. Friedman' will be released to Jesse Friedman's defense team, state Supreme Court Judge F. Dana Winslow ordered following a brief hearing.

The prosecutors said they intend to appeal Winslow's order, they had opposed the release, citing concerns about victims' privacy. 'After more than two decades, several guilty pleas, a complete appeal process, and a full and independent re-investigation, the victims in this case deserve closure and privacy,' said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for District Attorney Kathleen Rice. 'We are disappointed by the decision and will absolutely be appealing and expecting to prevail on behalf of the victims in a higher court.' Filmmaker Andrew Jarecki, second from right, speaks to reporters following a court hearing involving convicted child molester Jesse Friedman, standing to Jareck's right with his wife, Lisabeth Walsh. At left is Friedman's defense attorney, Ronald Kuby In June the DA's office had issued a 155-page report that reiterated that Friedman's original conviction in 1988 had been proper and correct. Friedman was just 19 years old when he and his father Arnold were jailed for allegedly molesting children who attended their after school computer class in Great Neck, New York. Jesse Friedman served 13 years in prison and was released in 2001. Now married and living in Bridgeport, Connecticut, he has been trying for more than a decade to clear his name. The documentary about the Friedman’s case – and the inconsistencies in the evidence against them – was released in 2002. Directed by Andrew Jarecki, ‘Capturing the Friedmans’ was nominated for the Academy Award for Documentary Feature in 2003. 'This ruling is an attempt to correct a fraudulent report that was based upon false information that the DA knew was fraudulent,' said Jarecki following Thursday's decision by Winslow. The Friedman case has drawn comparisons to the 1980s California McMartin preschool scandal involving allegations of sex abuse, but the investigators in their June report said the two cases 'were in no way similar.' Winslow on Thursday was particularly critical of a portion of the DA's report that claimed Jesse Friedman, while in prison in 2000, had written ""fictional"" stories that described violent and disturbing sexual acts, including incest involving a father and his children, sex with a dog and child rape. Jesse Friedman pictured in 1988, when he was 19 and then in 2004, three years after his release from prison after serving 13 years Prosecutors also said he had been disciplined for possessing a photograph of 2 pre-pubescent girls - at least 1 of whom was naked - torn from the pages of a magazine in violation of the terms of his sex offender counseling program. Defense attorney Ronald Kuby has maintained that Friedman was acquitted of those prison charges; a claim that an assistant district attorney reluctantly confirmed Thursday. 'We can't function in the justice system in this fashion,' the judge said in a scathing rebuke. 'This is a country that has no feeling of credibility when it comes to our institutions.' Since his release from prison in 2001, Friedman has been registered as a Level 3 sex offender which continues to prevent him from leading a normal life and prevents him from living near schools, playgrounds, day-care centers, and houses of worship. The nightmare for Jesse Friedman began in November 1987 after his father Arnold received a child pornography magazine in the mail from the Netherlands. Authorities were alerted and when they searched the Friedman home they found a stash of 20 magazines containing child porn. After learning that Arnold Friedman taught a computer class to children aged eight-to-10-year-old from his home, local police began to suspect him of abusing his students. Andrew Jarecki directed the film 'Capturing the Friedmans' and has spent the past 10 years working to help Jesse Friedman clear his name Jesse helped his father run the computer classes and so he too became a suspect. Initially detectives didn't find much evidence, but after some of the children were interviewed as many as 15 times they began to speak out about alleged abuse. Some children started to claim that Friedman had played bizarre sex games with them during their computer classes. Other claims strained credibility, one student would have had to have been molested an average of six times during every one of the 20 90-minute classes they took if their allegation was true. However with a witch-hunt brewing, Arnold and Jesse were charged with hundreds of counts of sodomy, sexual abuse, and employing a minor in an obscene performance. Initially they fought the charges, but as prosecutors added hundreds of new charges Arnold decided he had no choice but to plead guilty since the only physical evidence in the case was his collection of child porn. According to the family he confessed in the hopes that his son would be spared prison time. Police also accused Jesse's friend Ross Goldstein of joining the Friedmans' molestation. Faced with 118 charges against him, 17-year-old Goldstein admitting that he and Jesse had abused kids. In exchange for this testimony he was promised six months in jail and a cleansed record upon his release, but after testifying before the grand jury he was sentenced to two-to-six years in prison. Family torn apart by tragedy: Arnold Friedman (father), Elaine Friedman (mother) and their three boys, Jesse (left) David (middle), and Seth (right) at David Friedman's bar mitzvah Police searched Arnold Friedman's home and found his stash of 20 magazines containing child porn Facing life in prison, Jesse decided he had no choice but to cut his own deal. Then aged 19 he pleaded guilty to sexually abusing 14 children in his father's home computer class and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The court never heard from a witness or saw any evidence. Terrified of what awaited him in prison as a child molester, Jesse undertook some misguided damage-control. He gave an interview to Geraldo Rivera, inventing a story of his own abuse at the hands of his father. Once in prison, Jesse reverted to maintaining his innocence - a position that led to being denied parole four times. He was eventually released from prison in 2001 after serving 13 years of his sentence, while he father committed suicide in prison in 1995 by taking a massive overdose of antidepressant. In 2004, Friedman’s lawyers filed a motion arguing that newly available evidence warranted reopening the case. Now married, to wife Lisbeth, and living in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Jesse Friedman hopes his case will inspire other victims of injustice Successive courts rejected the appeal until 2010, when a federal appeals court took the unusual step and urged prosecutors to reopen the case, saying that Friedman may have been wrongfully convicted. The decision cited 'overzealousness' by law enforcement officials swept up in the hysteria over child molestation in the 1980s. The ruling noted that 'the quality of the evidence was extraordinarily suspect.' Taken together, the court said, 'the record here suggests ""a reasonable likelihood"" that Jesse Friedman was wrongfully convicted.' The DA's investigation took nearly three years to compile, but when it was released in June it wasn't the verdict that Friedman had been hoping for. The report not only affirmed Friedman's conviction, but 'added critical context, and in some cases supplied refuting evidence' to dis-spell theories put forward by Friedman and his advocates. Unperturbed by the DA's report, Friedman and his lawyers have continued to fight and will be hoping that the release 25-year-old documents used in his prosecution all those years ago will provide hope. Since his release from prison in 2001, Jesse Friedman has sought to clear his name and have his name removed from the sex offender register"

The Whitehall spending watchdog warned the scheme, which set an overall target of getting 20,000 into jobs, was ‘under-performing’ and urged ministers to intervene more quickly when things go wrong. The project is supposed to turn around so-called ‘Shameless’ families, with children back in school, crime cut and thousands of parents back in work. The Department for Work and Pensions project managed to get only 720 into a job, against a target of almost 20,000 Ministers said they wanted to end the ‘it’s not my fault’ culture which allowed up to 120,000 problem families to avoid taking responsibility for their own lives.

The Department for Work and pensions (DWP) aimed to get 22 per cent of people on the programme into work employment over three years to March 2015, with a budget of £200 million. But the National Audit Office (NAO) said the DWP programme had achieved only resulted in 720 people finding work, just 4 per cent of its target. None of the firms it was using to provide services had met the department's target. The NAO said that while there was evidence that families were beginning to benefit from the programmes, there was a risk that expectations will not be achieved. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ‘These innovative and ambitious programmes are beginning to provide some benefits but elements of both are underperforming. Community Secretary Eric Pickles said the 'no nonsense' approach of the scheme was working ‘This is the result of poor co-ordination between the departments when designing and implementing their programmes and of the risks taken in launching the programmes quickly.’ She claimed there was a lack of understanding about how councils and companies would use the payment by results scheme. ‘To achieve their objectives, the departments need to continue to liaise with one another and monitor the success rate of both programmes, adjusting them when necessary. ‘They must continue to work with local authorities and contractors to understand why performance is so varied, intervene if it does not improve, and quickly build an evidence base to show which interventions work best.’ Local authorities in England have turned around 22,000 families, exceeding a 3 per cent target, but they have attached only 62,000 families to the programme, 13 per cent below an NAO estimate. The Government has estimated that the cost to the taxpayer of troubled families was around £9 billion annually for the spending review period of 2010-2015, before the programme was introduced. Of the total, the Government estimated that £1 billion was spent tackling issues including mental health and drug and substance misuse, and £8 billion was spent reacting on areas including social care and the costs of crime, such as court costs. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, said: ‘It's difficult to see the DWP programme as anything other than a catastrophe for the vulnerable families who deserve our help but are being let down. ‘First with the work programme and now this, private companies are proving themselves incapable of providing the kind of complex, dedicated support necessary, despite the hundreds of millions of pounds of public money being funnelled their way.’ Mr Serwotka said the poor results also showed that giving work to private firms was ‘fantastically misguided.’ David Cameron launched the troubled families programme in the wake of the 2011 riots in London and other English cities A DWP spokesman said the numbers reported by the NAO only told part of the story, adding: ‘Jobcentre Plus is doing far more for members of troubled families, including loaning 150 jobcentre advisers to local authorities to help them support people into work. ‘Data published last week showed that since the troubled families programme started in April 2012, 2,400 members of troubled families started a job. This data only covered fewer than half the number of people from troubled families local authorities are currently working with, so we expect the real number helped into work to be much greater.’"

He said: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' Scroll down for video The planet is 'f**cked' after scientists found huge plumes of deadly methane escaping from the seafloor. This is according to Dr Jason Box who claims that methane could be the main driver of climate change The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane – which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. The leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. Leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature. Pictured are methane bubbles escaping from a lake in Alaska 'We're on a trajectory to an unmanageable heating scenario, and we need to get off it,' Dr Box told Brian Merchant at Motherboard 'We're f**ked at a certain point, right? It just becomes unmanageable. The climate dragon is being poked, and eventually the dragon becomes pissed off enough to trash the place.' Methane is the second-largest greenhouse gas contributor to climate change. The gas is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and is currently being targeted by government in an attempt to mitigate global warming. Methane pollution has declined by 11 per cent since 1990 even as the governments has pushed for greater use of natural gas. But the longer view on methane pollution show that it will rise. The Obama administration points to studies that show that methane pollution is projected to increase to a level equivalent to over 620 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, if no action is taken. The conventional thought is that the bubbles would be dissolved before they reached the surface and that microorganisms would consume that methane. But Dr Box said if the plumes are making it to the surface, there's a new source of heat-trapping gases that the planet needs to worry about. This, he claims, is particularly disturbing because the Arctic is warming faster than nearly anywhere else on Earth. His comments follow research in May which found that freshwater sources may be an unrealised source of methane. Unlike carbon dioxide, which is highly soluble in water, methane exists in two forms in these freshwater sources: as a dissolved gas and encapsulated in bubbles that rise from sediments. And this methane can lead to ozone production and levels of the gas in the atmosphere are 150 per cent higher than they were before the industrial revolution in U.S. It is already known that in the melting regions of the Arctic where lakes, known as thermokarsts, which are lakes that break down plant material into methane. This methane can then escape out of the lake, and once lit, could set ice on fire. The melting ice can also lead to 'drunken trees' as the firm soil slowly transforms into mud causing the plants that grow in them to lean to one side. 'I may escape a lot of this,' Dr Box told Motherboard, 'but my daughter might not. She's three years old.'

Raif Badawi, who co-founded the Free Saudi Liberals website, was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 1,000 lashes and a decade in prison for insulting Islam on his online forum. The start of his corporal punishment began after prayers today outside the Al-Juffali mosque in the city of Jiddah, which has earned the grisly nickname 'Chop Chop Square' as the site of executions. Raif Badawi, who co-founded the Free Saudi Liberals website, underwent the first round of 50 lashes in public Reports from the scene said Mr Badawi arrived at the mosque in a police car and had the charges read out to him in front of a crowd. He was then made to stand with his back to onlookers and whipped, though he remained silent throughout the ordeal. In a statement, Amnesty International said: 'He was removed from a bus in shackles and brought to the public square in front of the mosque. 'Surrounded by a crowd made up of the public and a number of security officers, he received 50 consecutive lashes on his back. 'The whole ordeal lasted around 15 minutes. Afterwards he was put back in the bus and taken away.' The rest of the sentence would be carried out over a period of 50 weeks, the rights watchdog group said. A whip, a leather strap or a long cane can be used to carry out floggings in Saudi Arabia, according to corpun.com, a website dedicated to the study of corporal punishment. 'Sometimes the lashes are confined to the buttocks, more often it seems they are spread out from the neck to the ankles, and usually with the prisoner simply lying face down on the ground. 'In one or two reports the offender was said to be tied upright to a post,' said corpun.com. A whip, a leather strap or a long cane may be used to carry out floggings in Saudi Arabia (pictured) Mr Badawi was publicly flogged today as part of his jail term for 'ridiculing Islamic religious figures' The sentence was widely condemned by human rights groups. Said Boumedouha of Amnesty International said: 'The flogging of Raif Badawi is a vicious act of cruelty which is prohibited under international law. 'By ignoring international calls to cancel the flogging Saudi Arabia's authorities have demonstrated an abhorrent disregard for the most basic human rights principles.' Mr Badawi was arrested in June 2012 and prosecuted for offences including cyber crime and disobeying his father. Following his arrest, his wife and children left the kingdom for Canada. The prosecution had demanded he be tried for apostasy, which carries the death penalty in Saudi Arabia, but a judge dismissed that charge. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, a fine of 1 million Saudi riyals ($266,666) and 1,000 lashes last year after prosecutors challenged an earlier sentence of seven years and 600 lashes as too lenient. Yesterday the US tried - but failed - to convince Riyadh to cancel the sentence of 1,000 lashes. Badawi's lawyer Waleed Abul-Khair was sentenced in July to 15 years imprisonment and barred from traveling for another 15 years after being found guilty by an anti-terrorism court of 'undermining the regime and officials,' ''inciting public opinion' and 'insulting the judiciary.' Saudi Arabia's legal code follows sharia law. Judges are trained as religious scholars and have broad scope to base verdicts and sentences on their own interpretation of religious texts."

The book, titled ""Hidden in the Office,"" contains 23 rules for getting ahead in the workplace. For example: Rule 8: Those who are just above you in the hierarchy are the most dangerous. Those of similar rank are enemies. Rule 11: You don't have to be loyal to your boss. You use him. Rule 12: You are the dumbest if you think you are the smartest. Rule 18: You have to worry when your boss tells you not to worry. Each rule is accompanied by an allegorical story surrounding the life of a white collar worker in a multi-national company that illustrates what the rules mean and how to put them into practice. More than a million copies have been sold. Lu is not alone in his success. In China, where competition is cutthroat and workplaces are characterized by opaque politics, complicated relationships and twisted love affairs, an entire literary genre has emerged on how to navigate a job-scape that is more like law of the jungle and survival of the fittest. The genre, known as Zhichang xiaoshuo, or ""workplace novels,"" is comprised of hundreds of titles offering practical career advice conveyed via soap opera tales about secretaries, salespeople, entrepreneurs, executives, even government officials, and what they had to do to get ahead in their careers. Many are authored by employees who, using pen names, chronicle their workplace stories and the scandals, sex and secrets they experienced while on the job (think ""Secret Life of a Call Girl"" meets ""Your Dream Career for Dummies."") ""The middle class is still developing in China,"" said Lu. ""Most people want to climb up to that level. They want to have better lives. They have ambitions, and they want to achieve it. They acquire knowledge from wherever they can. Books are one of the ways."" ""Du Lala's Promotion Diary,"" the story of how a secretary climbs the corporate ladder of a Fortune 500 company to become a human resources manager, is one of the genre's most famous works. It has sold millions of copies, inspired a movie, television series and three sequels. How the internet is changing China's office politics In ""The Boiling Money Route,"" author Xu Yu exposes the collision of government and business in a shadow banking industry in Wenzhou, a city near Shanghai known for its ruthless entrepreneurs and questionable business ethics. Xu Yu ""grew up in a wealthy family, worked at his family's bank, a stock company and also fooled around in underground gambling,"" says the book's cover. ""So he has lots of inside stories,"" it boasts. ""Xie Zhengxiang, the owner of a leading underground bank, acquires 100 million marketable securities from his mistress, Wang Anxiang. Before he can launder this through the black market operated by a Wenzhou guru, the situation of underground finance changed when an investigation team was sent by the government,"" the book's summary says. ""Special Promotion: How a Small Potato Gets Promoted"" is a tale of how to move upwards as a government official ""in a non-traditional way."" Even quirkier titles include ""The Confession of a Beautiful Female Department Head in Prison."" There are eight books in a series called ""The Notebook of a Government Department."" Subject matter ranges from ""how to get the leader of your leader to notice you"" to ""the higher you go, the more politics are involved."" Are cool offices the key to success?

Dancy Liang, a 32-year-old administrative assistant at a university in Shanghai, says such novels have helped her to know how to dress better and deal with sometimes complicated relationships.

The infectious disease attacks the nervous system and can lead to paralysis, disability and even death. At 14 months old, Julia spent 18 weeks in hospital and doctors predicted she would be disabled. But her parents refused to accept this. Incredibly, Julia became a dancer and fitness instructor before going into TV. 'I've never known if I was always destined to be a tough cookie and that's why I made a good recovery, or if having polio made me determined,' says Julia, 56, a QVC shopping channel presenter. But she has discovered that the disease she thought she'd overcome more than 50 years ago has a devastating sting in its tail - she's one of the 80 per cent of patients who, years later, experience a return of the symptoms of muscle loss, cramps, weakness and fatigue known as post-polio syndrome. Julia doesn't remember having polio, but knows she was close to death. 'In the summer of 1957 my mother noticed I'd stopped trying to pull myself up and walk and instead just wanted to sit,' says Julia, who lives with her partner Chris in Epsom, Surrey, and has two children, Daniel, 26, and Sophie, 25. She was rushed to hospital and put into isolation. Her parents, six-year-old sister and three-year-old brother could only look at her through a window on visits. 'To find out how I was, my parents had to read our local paper where there were lists of patients categorised as critically ill, dangerously ill and seriously ill,' she says. 'I was on the critically ill list. A fortnight later my father saw my name was gone. For a terrible moment they thought I hadn't made it, until they saw I'd been moved to “dangerously ill”.' After six weeks in isolation she was moved to a general ward. The polio affected Julia's left leg - the muscles had wasted so much it was shorter than the right. 'I was allowed home on Christmas Eve with my leg in a calliper. The doctors said I'd always have to wear it,' says Julia. Progress: Before the invention of the iron lung, a machine that fills lungs with air by making the chest rise, children with polio died frequently 'But my parents heard about a hospital consultant teaching children who'd had polio to swim and dance, and signed me up. At home my mother spent hours each day doing physiotherapy to strengthen my leg muscles.' Gradually, Julia's leg improved and she started walking without the calliper. By the age of 11, her left leg was strong enough for her not to need special shoes. She played tennis and netball, danced and swam. Today, the only sign she has is a slight limp, and she doesn't wear high heels as she hasn't got enough control in her ankle to balance in them. Up to 45,000 people were infected by the poliomyelitis virus during the British outbreak in the Fifties, many of them children. In the majority of cases, the virus caused minor flu symptoms or 'abortive' polio - many had it without realising. However, 1 per cent of patients developed paralytic polio, says Professor Carolyn Young, a neurologist at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, which has a polio clinic. 'Here, the virus attacks the nervous system rather than just the throat, and the patient may become paralysed to such a degree they are unable to move or breathe. 'Before the invention of the iron lung [a machine that uses air pressure to make the chest rise, so the lungs can fill with air], these children would die.' Thanks to a vaccine programme in the Sixties, polio has been eradicated, though it remains a problem in Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan. But 80 per cent of survivors later experience post-polio syndrome, though doctors don't know why. The symptoms - pain and weakness, fatigue and muscle loss - can strike any time from 15 to 50 years after the initial disease. 'It may not be that it comes back, but that the recovery of the nervous system against the virus starts to fail as you age,' says Professor Young. 'It's a terrible double whammy. You struggle with this illness and overcome it, then later in life you may end up back in a wheelchair.' Julia knew nothing about this cruel after-effect until several years ago when, working for a local news station, she interviewed a man with the syndrome. 'I remember coming home and speaking to Chris about it and becoming tearful,' she says. 'The thought of polio coming back is really frightening.' Then, four years ago she noticed her right leg was numb. There is no definitive test for post-polio syndrome: diagnosis is based on symptoms. 'My GP hasn't confirmed it's post-polio syndrome yet, but I think I'm heading that way,' says Julia. 'I'm much more tired than I used to be and my left leg is thinner. If it gets any worse, I'll seek professional advice.' Though there is no cure, there are techniques for managing symptoms, such as mobility aids, and pacing, a type of physical therapy that helps with fatigue by reducing the pace of activity. Up to 120,000 people in Britain are thought to have the condition: 45,000 linked to the Fifties outbreak, with others affected before and after - the last reported case here was 1982. This is as many people as have Parkinson's disease, explains Ted Hill, chief executive of the British Polio Fellowship. Double misfortune: Many who survive polio the first time, like these two women in rehabilitation, will later experience post-polio syndrome He says: 'We're even seeing some people who had the mild abortive form of polio developing post-polio syndrome with muscle pain and weakness. 'However, GPs don't recognise post-polio syndrome as well as they could. It's not taught in medical school because polio has been consigned to the history books. 'As a result, people affected are being told it's old age, so they may not get the support they need.' A survey by the British Polio Fellowship found 69 per cent of GPs rated their level of awareness of post-polio syndrome as low; 42  per cent said they would need to refer a suspected case to a neurologist for diagnosis. Eighteen months ago, Julia was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia, which typically develops very slowly, and she is taking chemotherapy tablets. 'It's muddied the waters for me as I feel incredibly tired and don't know whether it's the leukaemia or post-polio syndrome,' she says. Close up: The polio virus. Up to 120,000 people in Britain are thought to have the syndrome 'Sometimes everything feels like a real effort and it takes me much longer to recover from exercise, so I'm having physiotherapy.' She wants to raise awareness of post-polio syndrome. 'If people know they've got it, they can manage their lives better.

But Christian Louboutin’s red-bottomed shoes could face competition from high street lookalikes after a court ruled fashion chain Zara could sell heels in the same colour. Louboutin initially sued  the Spanish brand in 2008, claiming that an open- toed red-soled shoe it was selling for £40 was similar to its Yo Yo style. However a French court ruled that Zara’s cut-price shoe could not be confused with that made by the high-end designer. And last week the Cour de Cassation – the final court of appeal – upheld the decision. It also ruled that Louboutin, whose shoes are favoured by celebrities including Victoria Beckham and Sarah Jessica Parker and cost hundreds of pounds a pair, must pay the chain £2,000 in compensation. Alexis Mourot, group chief operating officer and general manager of Christian Louboutin, said the company would continue defending its soles. In 2008, Louboutin registered a trademark, claiming the exclusive right to make shoes with red soles for ‘women’s high fashion designer footwear’. And last year the shoemaker accused designer Yves Saint Laurent of copying his celebrated red-soled footwear, when he used a similar theme in his 2011 resort collection. That lawsuit resulted in a high-court appeal case in the US, the verdict of which is yet to be decided. Earlier this year, Louboutin told French newspaper Libération why the cause is important to him and his brand identity and that he is aware he cannot 'monopolise' a colour. Victory: Zara have won the right to sell their red-soled heels, left, which Louboutin said copied their Yo Yo slingbacks, right Seeing red: In April 2011 Christian Louboutin sued YSL for using red soles on the bottom of its red pumps, demanding $1million in damages He said: 'I understand that, but it is a red in a specific context, there is Ferrari red [and] Hermès orange. 'Even in the food industry, Cadbury recently won a lawsuit against Nestlé for using purple packaging. 'All this proves that the colours play a part in a brand's identity. I'm not saying that red usually belongs to me - I repeat that this is about a precise red, used in a precise location.' Celebrity favourites: Amanda Holden, left, in Louboutin slingbacks and actress Hayden Panettiere flashes the famous red sole Louboutin said that he came up with the idea for his red sole heels, which are favoured by celebrities including Sarah Jessica Parker and Victoria Beckham, nearly 20 years ago, when he painted red nail polish on the black soles of a pair of women's shoes. His lawsuit against YSL reads: 'Mr Louboutin is the first designer to develop the idea of having red soles on women's shoes. 'The location of the bright colour on the outsole of a woman’s pump is said to provide an alluring 'flash of red' when a woman walks down the street, or on the red carpet of a special event.'

Ibrahim Naji El Maarfi, 20, and Mohammed Abdalsalam, 27, rode stolen bicycles from their barracks to Cambridge where they touched the lone women sexually and tried to put their hands up their skirts. Abdalsalam admitted two counts of sexual assault, one count of threatening behaviour towards a police officer and one count of theft. The two Libyan soldiers cycled from the base in Bassingbourn in Cambridgeshire to the city to stalk women El Maarfi pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault, one count of exposure and one count of theft. A third man, Khaled El Azibi, 18, charged with three counts of sexual assault and one count of theft refused to enter pleas at the hearing. The court heard how the soldiers - who all appeared in court wearing tracksuits - are based at Bassingbourn Barracks some 14 miles outside Cambridge. Prosecutor Paul Brown told the court: 'The most serious aspect of it it there are males targeting females under the cover of darkness. 'They are like a pack preying on women in the hours of darkness. 'These women were by themselves at night and they were vulnerable.' Mr Brown said the first victim was walking on her own at 10.30pm when the men approached her before touching her at 'various times'. El Maarfi then exposed his penis to her. Mr. Brown said: 'She was clearly distressed by the incident.' The crimes were caught on CCTV and the 'pack' was seen to ride off. They then met two more women who were together and sexually assaulted them. The soldiers left the barracks on stolen bikes and made their way to Cambridge where they stalked women Cambridge magistrates said they were unable to sentence the two who pleaded guilty and they will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court at a later date. They were both remanded in custody together with El Azibi whose case will be dealt with at the higher court. The court heard that the two soldiers who pleaded guilty have been told they are not allowed to return to their camp and are 'likely' to face deportation. They were remanded in custody because they 'have nowhere to go' and are a 'danger to the public'. Up to 2,000 Libyan troops are due to be trained at Bassingbourn in separate groups over a 15 month period, with the aim of them returning home and helping to achieve Philip Hammond's aim to make the country more stable. More than 300 Libyan soldiers arrived at the barracks in June to start a 24-week course. They are being taught basic infantry and junior command skills in a bid to help bring stability to the war-torn country on their return. They are currently being trained by the 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland. Bassingbourn has been beset by problems after three North African soldiers stationed there were detained after breaking orders not to go tothe local Tesco. The incident escalated when up to 20 of their comrades stormed the area where they were being kept to demand their release. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."

The Brazil international, who joined United from Porto in 2007, has been rewarded for some recent superb performances, after returning to the side following a knee ligament injury. And the 22-year-old was particularly impressive in United's 1-0 win over Arsenal on Monday -- a result that saw Alex Ferguson's side return to the top of the table and keep alive their unbeaten league record this season. Speaking to the official United website, Ferguson said: ""We are delighted he has signed a new contract. ""Anderson has developed tremendously since joining us and he has fantastic potential at only 22 -- he is going to be a really top player."" The player himself added: ""This is the best club to be at and I would like to thank everyone for the great support I have received over the years.

Forty-nine per cent do not know that diet affects people's risk of getting cancer, the poll found. Other results show even more - three out of five Britons - did not know that body weight was linked to cancer, with overweight and obese people more at risk. A study has found 49 per cent of Brits do not know that diet affects people's risk of getting cancer. Pictured here is a human cancer cell Around two thirds of people questioned were unaware of links between processed meat and lack of physical activity, and the disease. A third incorrectly believe the chances of getting cancer are mainly due to family history of the disease even though only five to ten per cent of cancers are linked to inherited genes. The YouGov survey of 2,000 Britons was carried out for World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), a charity which promotes ways of preventing the disease. Experts say modern lifestyles are fuelling the rise of the disease, including alcohol, lack of exercise and being overweight. According to official figures, most people are overweight or obese in England. This includes 61.9 per cent of adults and 28 per cent of children aged between 2 and 15. Amanda McLean, World Cancer Research Fund's General Manager, said the findings showed many myths about cancer were still widely believed, instead of people taking personal responsibility for reducing their risk. (File picture) Experts say modern lifestyles are fuelling the rise of the disease, including alcohol, lack of exercise and being overweight She said: 'On World Cancer Day 2014 it's very alarming to see that such a large number of people don't know that there's a lot they can do to significantly reduce their risk of getting cancer. 'We would like all sectors of society - including the government, manufacturers, retailers and charities - work together to raise cancer prevention awareness. 'In the UK, about a third of the most common cancers could be prevented through being a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet and being regularly physically active. 'These results show that many people still seem to mistakenly accept their chances of getting cancer as a throw of the dice. But by making lifestyle changes today, we can help prevent cancer tomorrow.' Previous research by WCRF suggested almost 80,000 Britons each year could avoid getting one of 12 major cancers if they adopted healthier lifestyles. It said two out of five cases could be prevented if those with the worst diets, drinking and exercise habits adopted healthier habits for life. Almost half of breast cancer cases could be avoided if women drank less, ate healthier foods and exercised more, it found. As a result 20,000 women a year would probably not develop breast cancer by adopting a healthier lifestyle from an early age. World Cancer Research Fund, alongside the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), said there were four steps to help to reduce the risk of developing cancer: * Eat a healthy diet with lots of vegetables, fruit, pulses and wholegrains. * Limit alcohol and red meat and try to cut out processed meat. * Keep your weight at a healthy level (Body Mass Index of between 18.5 and 25) because being overweight is the biggest cancer risk factor after smoking. * Be physically active for at least 30 minutes every day. Activity can be divided over the day and should increase breathing and heart rate. The recommendations were developed by a panel of world-renowned scientists, after considering a detailed report on the links between lifestyle and cancer that examined all relevant scientific evidence. Cary Adams, Chief Executive Officer at UICC, said 'Governments around the world, including the UK, must recognise the growing cancer burden in their country and act on it now. 'On World Cancer Day, we demand that health leaders commit to reducing the millions of predicted, needless and premature deaths caused by cancer by focusing efforts and funds on proven preventive and early detection measures.'"

Recent solar flares have meant electrically-charged particles - which are the cause of the light displays - have appeared further south than usual Last night, a solar flare hurled vast clouds of these particles towards Earth – producing displays such as this one, not only in Scotland, but also in some parts of north England.

Mr Winiarczyk added: 'I was expecting the aurora display because a big explosion on the sun was reported with clouds of ejected plasma coming towards earth.

The Queen's granddaughter will carry the iconic flame down the finishing straight of the Cheltenham Racecourse in Gloucestershire tomorrow. The 31-year-old will be riding her faithful horse, Toytown, who is now retired, and will light a cauldron at the racecourse, which will burn throughout the country-wide event. She met torchbearers Eleanor Smallwood, 15, and Toby Jones, 15, as well as children from Chilton Foilat Primary School in Hungerford, as the flame was carried from Taunton to Glastonbury to Bristol in the west of the country. Meanwhile, a woman was warming up to carry the torch today - just seven days after giving birth to her new-born son. Eleanore Regan, 28, was supposed to run with the flame while heavily pregnant, but gave birth to William eight days early, last Wednesday. The charity worker, who is also battling a brain tumour, still ran 300-metres through Bath, Somerset, with the torch yesterday while tiny William looked on. The torch resumed its epic journey at 8am this morning, starting in Taunton and heading through Ilminster and Glastonbury towards Bristol, where it ended the day at around 6pm .

Sarah Milner Simonds, 38, has attracted attention in recent days since controversially placing her official torch and uniform on eBay to raise money for the community gardening group The People’s Plot. The community gardener - who ran with the flame through Dunster, Somerset, on Monday - said she was overjoyed and flabbergasted to find the auction had raised £153,100. But since the auction ended at 10.33pm on Sunday after attracting 163 bids, Sarah says the winning bidder has not been in touch and she fears it may have been a hoax. She said: 'EBay has strict rules stating bids are legally binding contracts and an invoice has been sent to the bidder for £153,100, but we have received no response so far. The buyer has a 100 per cent positive feedback rating based on previous purchases but just seems to have disappeared.' 'This is incredibly disappointing not only because The People’s Plot will miss out on this wonderful funding, but because it could now leave me out-of-pocket too. eBay has already been in contact asking me to pay the 10 per cent selling fee for the item, amounting to over £15,000. 'We just hope that the winning bidder comes forward and fulfils the deal.' Yesterday, rapper and music producer Will.i.am made a surprise appearance and carried the torch in Taunton town centre. He is one of several celebrities joining unsung heroes carrying the torch in areas including Glastonbury, Bath and Bristol today on the flame's journey through Britain. The torchbearers range in age from children to 91-year-old Doris Whiting. Mrs Whiting will be one of the oldest of the 8,000 torchbearers who will carry the Olympic flame on the way to the July 27 opening ceremony. The nonagenarian, from Trowbridge, will carry the flame through Shepton Mallet. Her nomination says he received an MBE in 2008 to recognise more than 30 years of community work. 'Doris is one of the few people I know who is instantly recognised by just her first name. Mention the name Doris in Trowbridge and everyone knows who you mean,' her nominator said. 'Not only Doris herself, but a great many in Trowbridge too would be delighted if she were to be selected for the honour of carrying the flame. A fitting climax to a long life of ceaseless service to the community.' There is also dedicated Gavin Harvey, 31, from Salisbury, who will carry the torch in Frome. He lost both legs while injured in a bomb blast while serving the Army in Afghanistan in August 2009. His wife, who nominated him, says: 'He lost both his legs, shattered his pelvis and suffered multiple internal injuries after spending 10 and a half weeks in hospital he was finally discharged. 'Since then he has been an inspiration to all who know him in his determination to live life to the full and still be a very active father to our two very young daughters.' A former heavy drinker and smoker who saw the error of her ways will carry the torch through Bristol. Joanne Plumbley, 36, from Tytherington, grew up disliking exercise but changed her lifestyle after joining the Territorial Army. 'Joanne grew up hating strenuous activity and was notoriously bad at games and sport,' her nominator says. 'By 20 she was a heavy drinker and smoker when she had a significant health scare. Subsequently she joined the Territorial Army as a combat medic which proved strong motivation for exercise.' A man who became a marathon runner after losing 14 stone in 18 months will be also be in the spotlight.

He said: 'My radio interviews speeches and pieces in the local newspaper helped to overturn a decision to close my school just weeks before the closure was finalised. 'I have already shown that if you put your mind to things you can achieve your desired goal.' There are 16 ‘core vehicles’ assigned to accompany the torch for its epic journey. Everywhere the procession goes, a small army of support and ancilliary vehicles is also called into service. In Cornwall on Saturday, for example, the convoy was escorted by police motorcyclists bearing the emblems of five separate constabularies. In south Devon, an ambulance, local dignitaries, firearms officers and police ‘safety officers’ on BMW mountain bikes joined the parade. It was a similar turnout yesterday in north Devon and Somerset, with a bomb disposal team in the convoy. The London Olympic organising committee insists the vehicle fleet is necessary for what it describes as a ‘huge’ logistical operation, adding that each one has a specific and important role. For the three most prominent vehicles on parade, that role is mostly commercial. Sponsors Coca-Cola, Samsung and Lloyds TSB each have a truck or coach kitted out in brand-name colours and they travel full time with the convoy. By the time the convoy gets to the Olympic stadium in July it will have left a massive carbon footprint. Dr Wendy Buckley, director of Carbon Footprint Ltd, which helps organisations to become carbon neutral, told the Daily Mail that if 47 was a typical daily average for vehicles, they were likely to emit a total of 223 tons of carbon dioxide. That would be equivalent to driving a Toyota Prius hybrid car more than 1.4million miles. Alternatively, of course, the runners could borrow a tip from ancient Greece – and just run."

Wangfujing Snack Street offers all sorts of exotic food, including sea horse. China's capital offers something for everyone -- from cheap street stalls to five-star gourmet eateries. Variety is the key -- from the more obvious delicacies such as fried fish, to things that are, well, a little more exotic. One great place in Beijing that offers both is Wangfujing Snack Street, in Dongcheng district. An ornate blue and gold archway marks the start of the street, which even at midday is already a bustling hive of hungry locals and curious tourists. Enticing smells swirl around continuously, as colorful characters shout out invitations to try their food. One guy, dressed in a red silk robe and black skullcap, sings out an invitation while holding a fan in one hand and his pigtail in the other. The type of food is extensive. Due to years of intermigration, almost every province is represented. There are lamb kebabs from Xinjiang, noodles from Gansu and spicy beef from Sichuan. And it's cheap: A stick of kebabs can be had for just 3 RMB (40 cents). There's also a lot for the sweet tooth, such as candy-covered apples in an array of vibrant colors, and whole coconuts filled with sweet water. But while the street's food is mostly conventional, there are also plenty of snacks on offer for the more adventurous. ""Welcome, where are you from?"" asks a friendly teenager, as he dangles a skewer of live scorpions in front of my eyes. ""Would you like to try? Only 8 RMB."" I'm too mesmerized by the scorpions' jiggling legs and snapping claws to offer a reply. He quickly shows me some of his other products for sale. They include sea horse (25 RMB), cicadas (5 RMB) and starfish (20 RMB). All are cooked by frying in oil, and can be accompanied by a variety of different sauces. Wangfujing Snack Street is a treasure, but for those who want to try something even a little more exotic, it might be worth jumping in a taxi for a 10-minute ride to Dongsishitiao Street, also in Dongcheng. The restaurant, Guo Li Zhuang (""strength inside a pot""), is unique in that it claims to be China's only specialty penis restaurant. It was started back in 2000 by a father-and-son team who also happen to be Chinese traditional doctors. ""They both used to buy a lot of different food products to eat, such as animal penis for good health,"" explains restaurant manager Nancy Lee.  Watch Nancy Lee discuss the food offerings available » ""Then they thought, if we are spending so much money buying this food, why not open up a restaurant that would benefit ourselves and friends? So it's not so much a business-oriented as a health-oriented idea."" The restaurant is formal and divided up into private dining booths. Any preconceptions of drunken customers making lewd jokes about the food choices quickly diminish. The menu is quite exhaustive -- and there are other choices to consider, including seafood, flowers, bean products and wild mushrooms. But there's one main focus. ""We serve the penis from nine different animals,"" says Lee. ""They are cow, sheep, dog, donkey, horse, deer, yak, snake and seal."" They are usually prepared in a hot pot or stir-fried, and one penis, according to traditional Chinese medicine, should be shared by three people. The meat dishes can be accompanied by assorted sauces such as lemon soy and chili soy, and any number of vegetable platters. The food, especially in a country with such inexpensive dining prices as China, isn't cheap. ""The average cost per person to dine here is about 500 RMB ($73),"" explains Lee. ""Our clientele is usually made up of government officials and wealthy businessmen."" Perhaps a one-of-a-kind experience they probably won't forget."

President Francois Hollande is expected to sign the bill into law on Saturday. After the lower house of Parliament, dominated by Hollande's governing Socialist Party, passed the bill last month, conservative and centrist senators filed a legal challenge with the court, the Constitutional Council. Same-sex marriage: Who will legalize it next? The legislation admits France to a small but growing club. Lawmakers in New Zealand this year made it the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalize same-sex marriage. The law is set to be enacted later this year. Its move came a week after Uruguayan lawmakers approved a measure allowing same-sex marriage. The measure awaits the signature of Uruguay's president, who has indicated he supports it. If and when the laws in New Zealand, Uruguay and France are enacted as expected, the count of nations allowing same-sex marriage will rise to 14. France would be the ninth country in Europe to allow same sex marriage. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001, with others following suit in Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. Argentina was the first Latin American nation to legalize such marriages, in 2010. Other countries on the list are Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. Many countries remain split over the issue. A Brazilian court this week issued a directive removing a barrier that had limited same-sex marriage, but no bill has made it through Congress. Legislators in the United Kingdom are also weighing proposals to legalize same-sex marriage. Lawmakers in Australia voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed ""support marriage equality."" In the United States, the question went before the Supreme Court and justices are now deliberating over the matter. Twelve U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriages. On the other side, many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying."

Hydrometeorologist Aron Gingis says that MH370's path could be revealed by analysing satellite images of clouds, as their patterns are changed by planes' 'contrails' – or condensation trails - interacting with them. In other words, every plane leaves breadcrumbs. Scroll down for video An image released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau that speculates the final path of the flight, west of Australia, using satellite ping data. Mr Gingis' expertise with cloud patterns is yet to be used in the hunt for MH370 Despite a massive multi-national search operation, not even 'a seat cushion' from the jet has been found It comes as British satellite company Inmarsat admitted that there is still 'significant doubt' over the location of MH370. Mr Gingis, who's head of the Australian environmental consultancy company Management Consolidated, wrote to the Malaysian High Commissioner Eldeen Husaini at the beginning of April and offered to help with the search effort, according to Au News. He said: 'I believe that we have a realistic chance to follow the flight path of Malaysia Airlines MH370 and follow its flight direction, possibly identifying its landing or crash site. 'I believe that we will be able to utilise our expertise and identify the flight pass of MH370 and then to direct the search and rescue authorities to save or recover MH370 passengers.' However, he was told 'thanks, but no thanks' by the Malaysian authorities, so instead sent his proposal to the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB). They were more interested but the two sides reached an impasse. The ATSB had several questions about Mr Gingis's techniques that Mr Gingis refused to answer for fear of his commercial interests being compromised. As a result, no trajectories for MH370 have been produced by Mr Gingis. Hydrometeorologist Aron Gingis says that MH370's path could be revealed by analysing satellite images of clouds. Pictured is the same model of 777 as the doomed flight The Fugro Discovery search vessel, pictured, will spend a further year searching for the aircraft's wreckage Inmarsat, meanwhile, which has been at the heart of the search for MH370, produced a report recently that left a question mark over whether the plane is even in the ocean. Writing in The Journal of Navigation, it said that while it believes 'MH370 changed course and… travelled in a southerly direction until it ran out of fuel in the southern Indian Ocean, west of Australia', it stressed that 'the sensitivity of the reconstructed ﬂight path to frequency errors is such that there remains significant uncertainty in the final location'. The Beijing-bound Boeing 777 lost contact with air traffic controllers after taking off with 239 on board from Kuala Lumpur on March 8. However, it transmitted signals to Inmarsat's Indian Ocean Region satellite, leading the company's analysts to conclude that it continued to fly 'for several hours after loss of contact'. The ATSB said: 'All the evidence - based on independent analysis of satellite, radar and aircraft performance data from many international experts - indicates the aircraft entered the sea close to a long but narrow arc in the southern Indian Ocean.' The ship Discovery, provided by Dutch contractor Fugro, was scheduled to arrive in the search zone about 1,800 kilometers (1,100) miles west of Australia on Wednesday, the ATSB said in a statement. The GO Phoenix, a Malaysian ship that has been combing the area since early October, is in the Western Australian city of Fremantle getting fresh supplies. Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who was in Australia to greet the GO Phoenix during its return to port, said everything possible was being done to find the Boeing 777, which inexplicably disappeared on March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. 'We must continue to hope because sometimes hope is all we have,' he said. 'We will find MH370.' The search ships are dragging sonar devices called towfish through the water about 100 meters (330 feet) above the seabed to hunt for the wreckage. The towfish, which are also equipped with jet fuel sensors, transmit data in real-time to those on board the vessels. The underwater search resumed in early October after being on hold for four months while crews mapped the seabed in the 60,000-square kilometer (23,000-square mile) search zone. The GO Phoenix has searched over 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) so far. Despite a massive air and sea search, not a single piece of debris from the plane has been found. Australian officials are still receiving reports from people who believe they have found wreckage washed up along the Australian coastline, but all have been false alarms. Drift modeling by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has shown any floating debris would likely have traveled west, away from Australia. Because of that, Australia asked Indonesian officials to be on the lookout for any wreckage, as it is possible some may have drifted to the island nation's coastline, the transport safety bureau said. Meanwhile, a third ship, the Fugro Equator, is still mapping areas of the search zone and will join the hunt once that is complete, likely in the next week or so. Emirates CEO and president Sir Tim Clark, pictured, said he believes MH370 was 'under control until the end' The search is expected to take up to a year. The chief executive of Emirates earlier claimed that 'control was taken of' Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 before it vanished. Sir Tim Clark said it was very important that the airline industry does not accept that the fate of MH370 is an 'unexplained mystery'. His airline, Emirates, operates almost 130 Boeing 777 aircraft, similar to the doomed jet. In an interview with German magazine Spiegel, Clark said: 'MH370 remains one of the great aviation mysteries. Personally, I have the concern that we will treat it as such and move on. At the most, it might then make an appearance on National Geographic as one of aviation's great mysteries. We mustn't allow this to happen. We must know what caused that airplane to disappear.' He added: 'MH 370 was, in my opinion, under control, probably until the very end.'"

If elected, Park -- the first woman ever nominated by the party, and the daughter of the country's former dictator -- would become the country's first-ever female president. Park won the support of her party running on a campaign of creating ""a country where no one is left behind."" Park has said she will focus on welfare policies if she is elected in December and will engage with North Korea if Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons program. Park hopes to unite a country that the legacy of her father, the late Park Chung-hee, still divides. The military dictator who went on to win elections was behind the rapid economic growth of South Korea during the 1960s, following the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to1953 and devastated the peninsula. Supporters say he economically transformed the country, but critics say he disregarded democracy to do so and committed human rights abuses. Under pressure from the Kennedy administration in the United States, Park re-established civilian rule and was elected in a national referendum in 1963, and easily re-elected in 1967, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald Gregg noted in a 1999 Time article. Park ""had a hard time beating Kim Dae-jung in 1971. The validity of Park's narrow election victory is still questioned. In 1972, fearing Kim's political potency, Park changed the election system, allowing indirect voting that could be controlled by the incumbent. In 1972 and again in 1978 he was easily elected for six-year terms,"" wrote Gregg, who had served as ambassador from 1989 to 1993. Park was assassinated by his security chief in 1979. Park Geun-hye lost to the current president, Lee Myung-bak, in the party's last primary in 2007. Lee can only serve one term under South Korean law.

Ramzi Yousef, 45, has been imprisoned since his capture in Pakistan in 1995 - two years after he killed six people and injured 1,000 others after detonating explosives beneath the North Tower. Since the September 11 attacks, the 45-year-old Pakistani national has been in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the federal ADX supermax prison in Colorado, known as 'the Alcatraz of the Rockies.' Yousef says that despite good behavior while behind bars, he remains in solitary solely because he is a terrorist - which he claims is a violation of his due process rights. In a letter to the prison's warden obtained by the Los Angeles Times, Yousef says: 'I request an immediate end to my solitary confinement and ask to be in a unit in an open prison environment where inmates are allowed outside their cells for no less than 14 hours a day.' 'I have been in solitary confinement in the U.S. since February 8, 1995, with no end in sight... I further ask not to be in handcuffs or leg irons when moved outside my cell.' The Times reports that Yousef doesn't even see the prison's guards, who push his meals through a small slot between two steel doors. The only other inmate within the sound of his voice is reportedly a man who has killed others while incarcerated. In August, Yousef's attorney Bernard Kleinman said his client wanted out of solitary because he was 'lonely' - and claimed that despite the World Trade Center attack, the 1994 bombing of a Philippine jet, a plot to kill Pope John Paul II and other plots - Yousef is 'no longer a threat.' Isolation: Since the September 11 attacks, Yousefl has been in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the federal ADX supermax prison in Colorado, which is known as 'the Alcatraz of the Rockies' Damage: This is the hole that was blown in the basement of the World Trade Center by the truck bomb Yousef detonated Catastrophic: Yousef had hoped the bomb blast would collapse the one tower into the other and bring both crumbling down 'I think it's just plain unfair,' Kleinman said outside court at the time. 'Most of the terrorists he knew are either dead or in jail.' Yousef was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted in the World Trade Center attack, as well as a plot to bomb 12 American airliners over the Far East. At his 1998 sentencing, Yousef defiantly proclaimed: 'Yes, I am a terrorist and am proud of it.' His uncle is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the September 11 terror atrocities that destroyed the World Trade Center towers and left nearly 3,000 people dead. Wounded: More than 1,000 people were injured in the World Trade Center attack Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef bragged that he was a terrorist at his sentencing in 1998. Now he says he's lonely He fled to the Middle East the night of the bombing and was captured two years later in Pakistan, where he was turned over to the FBI. He now lives in a 7-foot by 11-foot cell with a radio, a television, a desk, a toilet and a shower, Kleinman said. Since 1997, he has been subjected to special administrative measures reserved for prisoners who are believed to be a continuing threat to the country. The restrictions prevent Yousef from communicating with other prisoners and only allow him to meet with his lawyer, Kleinman said. For those visits, Yousef is shackled and forced to communicate through Plexiglass. The prison is also home to Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nicholas, 'underwear bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and 'shoe bomber' Richard Reid.

""What he is suggesting means that after the massacre, people will have no access to food, kerosene and medicines that came through those tunnels. That is not a cease-fire; that is a slow agonizing death,"" she said, according to The Times. Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone issued a statement backing the demonstration. ""Every day, we see appalling pictures of children slaughtered by Israeli bombs, missiles and other sophisticated weapons,"" he said.

His appearance at the event - billed as the largest remaining working class demonstration in the country - has been warmly welcomed by local trade unionists and party activists. But the Conservatives said he was ‘cosying up’ to Labour's left-wing union paymasters who secured the leadership for him. Labour's return: Ed Miliband holds son Daniel as he greets crowds on the balcony of County Hall, Durham An estimated 100,000 people attended the gala, also known as The Big Meeting. Mr Miliband took to the balcony of the County Hotel as Labour leaders of the past have done for decades, watching some of the 80 or so miners' banners and around 50 brass bands parade past. Afterwards he addressed the large crowd on the old Racecourse, where he hit out at the bankers, Rupert Murdoch and ‘the rip-off’ of Britain's energy companies. He listed some of the Labour heroes who have spoken before him at past galas, including Keir Hardie, Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Barbara Castle. ‘I am proud to follow in their footsteps,’ he said. ‘I am proud to be here today.’ Throng: Mr Miliband speaks to a crowd of around 100,000 trade union and other activists in Durham yesterday Support: Miliband waves to miners as they head towards the Durham Miners' Gala on the old Racecourse Tradition: Durham Miners make their way towards the Durham Miners' Gala on the old Racecourse Afterwards, he denied he had taken an electoral risk. He said: ‘The stakes are so high in this country. ‘If you are someone who is looking for work, whose living standards have been squeezed, or someone worried about the NHS you're not thinking why's Ed Miliband going to the Durham Miners' Gala, you are thinking what can Ed Miliband do for me.’ Mr Kinnock was the last Labour leader to attend in 1989, even though Tony Blair's Sedgefield constituency was part of the Durham Coalfield. The Conservative Party co-chairman Baroness Warsi said that by attending the event, Mr Miliband was cosying up to his ‘militant, left-wing paymasters’. But Mr Miliband said: ‘When you see people marching past as I did from the balcony of that hotel, a march people have been doing for 140 years, I think that it is not just about politics, it is about the strengths of these communities. ‘The idea that the people here are a bunch of militants, as some of my opponents say, is nonsense.’ Support: Labour leader Ed Miliband, carries his son Daniel, three, prior to making his speech Piggyback: Mr Miliband, carries his son Daniel around the Old Racecourse - usually Durham University's cricket pitch David Hopper, secretary of the Durham Miners' Gala which organises the event, praised Mr Miliband for venturing into the ‘lion's den’. He has previously branded Labour leaders who declined to come as ‘jokers’ who had insulted the region's heritage. ‘The ghost is buried,’ he said. ‘It was worth waiting 23 years for that type of reaction. ‘I was impressed (with the speech).

He concluded it by vowing to rebuild Britain, saying: ‘We understand our task for the future - to rebuild our country... on the values of the people of Britain: responsibility, community, fairness, equality and justice. ‘That's our mission, that's our task, that's the battle we can win together.’ Mr Miliband was surrounded by well-wishers as he made his way from the stage to the Labour Party tea tent."

The pilot scheme, which could be rolled out across 46 operating theatres in the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, could cost taxpayers more than £18,000 if funded by the NHS. In a pilot trial, patients at Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford have watched their favourite films, surfed the net and checked their emails during 10 hour local anaesthetic surgeries. The pilot scheme is hoped to help distract people from often lengthy regional anaesthetic surgery, which requires absolute stillness. However, Dia Chakravarty, political director at The Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will wonder if this really is the best use of their money when necessary savings are having to be made across the public sector. 'People expect their taxes to pay for doctors and cancer drugs. 'The trust's decision to spend money on iPads will leave hard-pressed families wondering if the trust has got its priorities right.' One of the first patients to try the scheme watched a film, checked emails and played chess during a nine-and-a-half-hour hip replacement and lower limb orthoplastic surgery. With the lowest range iPad retailing at £399, purchasing enough iPads to cover each of the trust's operating theatres would cost £18,354. However, the trust has not specified what sort of tablet would be used if it were to go ahead on a larger scale. The trial, was held at Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre (pictured) in Oxford Logo: The pilot scheme could be rolled out across 46 operating theatres in the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust (pictured) The idea of using an iPad during surgery came from consultant anaesthetists Svetlana Galitzine and James Matthews for limb surgery patients. They read research that found patients preferred being kept awake as it improved recovery times, but needed some sort of distraction to keep them relaxed. The iPad used for the trial was mounted on a docking unit, which also comes with headphones, meaning patients can have the screen adjusted for comfort. Dr Galitzine said: 'Many patients can feel anxious at being conscious during an operation, so we are pleased that we have been able to develop a way of making that experience less stressful. 'We are currently assessing patients’ experiences with this technique and finalising patients’ preoperative information leaflets which can help them to make informed choice. 'Most operations can be done under local or regional anaesthetic, as long as the kit is available and the patient, anaesthetist and the surgeon agree to use this technique. 'Feedback from patients so far has been very positive.' Trust spokesman Martin Leaver said: 'This is in the very early stages, but we think we are the first in the country to try it.'"

After getting hold of around 300 erotic magazines Primas de Riesgo, or Risk Premium, registered as a porn distributor earlier this year. With the sales tax on porn less than a fifth of that on plays, they now give a 'free ticket' to their production of 'The Prodigious Magician' with every 16 Euro (£12.50) porn magazine they sell. The all-women Primas de Riesgo theatre group registered as a porn distributor earlier this year. Members of the audience are given a free ticket for shows when they buy a pornographic magazine to get around a sales tax hike The group's director Karina Garantiva said it was immoral that magazine sales taxes stood at four percent, while duty on theatre tickets stands at 21 percent The Spanish government raised sales taxes in 2012 in a bid to rein in the public deficit. Within a year audiences fell from 13.1 million to 9.3 million across Spain The group hopes the Spanish government will lower the sales tax on tickets to 10 percent 'If the sales tax changes, we will suspend our campaign. If not, we will pursue this until the end,' the group's director, 34-year-old Karina Garantiva told the AFP. 'We are either part of the problem or part of the solution. We shouldn't complain, we should work to change it.' Audiences at cultural events have slumped since Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative government raised sales tax on tickets to films, plays and concerts from eight percent to 21 percent in September 2012. In the first 12 months after it took effect audiences fell from 13.1 million to 9.3 million, a 29 percent decline, according to figures from Spain's National Federation of Theatre and Dance Business Associations (FAETEDA). 'It's a real state of emergency,' said Jesus Cimarro, a Madrid theatre producer who heads the association. But in its bid to rein in the public deficit and rocketing unemployment, the government did not raise the sales tax on magazines, which remained at four percent, allowing Primas de Riesgo to take advantage of the loophole. 'We want people to ask what kind of a society makes this kind of decision. That they compare pornography and Calderon, who is Spain's Shakespeare, and reach their own conclusions,' said Garantiva. Pointing out that the sales tax in neighbouring France and Germany is only a fraction of the Spanish cost, the group has called the government to reduce the sales tax on theatre tickets to 10 percent, the same rate as in Italy, which is also under pressure to reduce its public deficit. But lawmakers have argued that the sales tax hike on theatre tickets is needed to balance the public accounts and has shown no sign that it is willing to lower it. Critics have also questioned the morality of distributing pornography alongside a classic Spanish playwright, but Garantiva hit back. 'What is immoral is not that women distribute porn magazines,' she said. 'But that the government offers subsidies to these publications and not to its cultural heritage.'"

Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani army's chief of staff. Pressured by Washington to crack down on terrorists at the same time he was kept in the dark about the U.S. raid to kill Osama bin Laden, Kayani ""is facing more vocal and strident criticism than he has in the past,"" a senior U.S. military official told CNN. ""We really think he is coming under increased scrutiny by junior and mid-grade officers."" This is the type of scrutiny senior Pakistani generals like Kayani are ""not accustomed to facing,"" the official said. Criticism of Kayani inside Pakistan had grown in recent months as he became close to the Obama administration and the Pentagon. But in the wake of the U.S. military raid into Pakistan to kill bin Laden, the criticism has increased from an officer corps furious that U.S. troops invaded Pakistan's territory without the Pakistani military, and especially Kayani, being consulted. Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, is one of Kayani's closest professional and personal allies, having met with him many times in the past several years. ""Mullen does consider him a friend,"" said the admiral's spokesman, Capt John Kirby. ""That doesn't mean there aren't still disagreements. It doesn't mean Kayani doesn't feel betrayed."" U.S. officials are closely watching a group known as the ""11 corps commanders,"" the senior Pakistani generals hand-picked by Kayani to command. Keeping their loyalty will be crucial for Kayani to keep his job. At his final Pentagon news conference Thursday before stepping down at the end of the month, Gates warned that no matter how much strain exists between the two countries, cooperation must be preserved. ""We need each other and we need each other more than just in the context of Afghanistan. Pakistan is an important player in terms of regional stability and in terms of central Asia, and my view is that this is a relationship that we need to keep working at it."" Incoming Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on June 9 sounded a similar warning: ""This is a difficult challenge. The relationship with Pakistan is at the same time one of the most critical and yet one of the most complicated and frustrating relationships that we have."" Panetta said it is ""complicated by the fact that they maintain relationships with certain terrorist groups, that they continue to not take aggressive action with regard to these safe havens, and that they're concerned about the sovereignty results and criticisms of the United States when, in fact, my view is that the terrorists in their country are probably the greatest threat to their sovereignty."" For his part, Mullen, also testifying before Congress this week, said he wouldn't ""push back"" on the challenge of working with Pakistan. ""Some of the criticism is more than warranted. Nobody's worked that harder than me, very frankly, with the leadership. And it's a conscious decision, I think, that we have to make. And if we walk away from it, it's my view it will be a much more dangerous place a decade from now, and we'll be back."""

The reclusive writer of To Kill A Mockingbird has shunned the spotlight following the success of her Pulitzer prize-winning first and only novel in 1960, refusing to do interviews or make public appearances. However Marja Mills, a former Chicago Tribune reporter, claims to have become friends with Lee after moving into the house next door to her in Monroeville, Alabama, for 18 months in 2004. Mills has now written a book about the experience, The Mockingbird Next Door: Life With Harper Lee, which was released by The Penguin Press on Tuesday and is being pushed as the first official account of Lee's life. Hitting back: Extremely private author Harper Lee, 88, has released a statement saying she did not cooperate with a new book about her life and that she was 'saddened' and 'hurt' by the writer Under fire: Journalist Marja Mills (left) maintains she was always honest with Harper Lee during their 18-month friendship that she was writing a book As Mills writes: 'I wasn't an unknown quantity but someone she (Harper Lee) knew and trusted.' 'I could not have done (the book) without the trust, support, and encouragement of Nelle (as Harper Lee is known) and (her sister) Alice Lee and their closest friends.' But Lee, 88, has now released a letter to Entertainment Weekly to deny having anything to do with the project. 'Miss Mills befriended my elderly sister, Alice. It did not take long to discover Marja's true mission: another book about Harper Lee,' the statement said. 'I was hurt, angry, saddened, but not surprised. 'I immediately cut off all contact with Miss Mills, leaving town whenever she headed this way. 'Rest assured, as long as I am alive, any book purporting to be with my cooperation is a falsehood.' It is the second statement Lee has released on the book. The first was dated April 27, 2011. At the time Lee wrote: 'Contrary to recent news reports, I have not willingly participated in any book written or to be written by Marja Mills. Neither have I authorized such a book.' A big part of the dispute is a letter Mills has written by Lee's sister Alice. 'Delicious mystery': Harper Lee, 88, has lived an extremely private life since the release of her first and only book, To Kill A Mockingbird, in 1960 Responding to the claims on Tuesday, Mills refers to the letter, while maintaining her book is not a Harper Lee biography but a collection of stories that Lee chose to share with her. The written letter I have from Alice Lee, which she sent May 2011 in response to the original letter issued in Nelle's name, makes clear that Nelle Harper Lee and Alice gave me their blessing,' Mills said. 'In regard to the writing and release of Nelle Harper Lee's April 2011 statement about my book, Alice Lee (Alice Lee practiced law until she was 100 years old) wrote: 'Poor Nelle Harper can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence. Now she has no memory of the incident.' "" Penguin also released a statement on Tuesday, saying: 'Penguin Press is proud to publish The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee by Marja Mills today. The book, a southern gothic novel that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1962, has sold over 30 million copies This photo of Harper Lee, taken in an Alabama courthouse, was shot around the time she released To Kill A Mockingbird in 1960 'Mills' memoir is a labor of love and Marja Mills has done an extraordinary job. We look forward to sharing her story of the wise and wonderful Lee sisters with readers.' Early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. USA Today book critic Charles Finch gave it 3.5 stars out of four, calling it a 'thoughtful, sweet-tempered, witty piece of work."" He also noted that ""Mills wrote her story with the approval of both sisters, and it sometimes reads more like a friend's account than a reporter's, which may be why it doesn't pry too insistently into Lee's secrets.' To Kill A Mockingbird has sold more than 30 million copies. Lee has not given an official interview since the book came out, but has intermittently released statements to media. She has been described as a 'delicious mystery', and while having started other books, one a non-fiction about an Alabama serial killer, she filed them away as unfinished. She is said to have been crippled by the pressure to match the success of her debut."

Andrew Chimboza, 35, told Cape Town police in a statement that he killed Mbuyiselo Manona, 62, in self-defence at the home of a client in the township of Gugulethu after being insulted. Prosecutor Quawnita Geyer read out the statement during a bail hearing at the Athlone Magistrate’s Court in Cape Town on Wednesday. He said: ‘In your warning statement you say... “I sit upon him and stabbed him on the chest, tore out his heart and took a knife and then sliced his heart and then I ate his heart.” “’The reason for me to eat the unknown guy's heart was to show him that I am not a moffie [gay] and after I finished eating the heart, I realised he was dead.”’ Investigating officer Constable Mphumelelo Yengwa attended the autopsy and reported its horrifying conclusion. According to The Citizen he said: ‘It was conducted by Dr Allie. Dr Allie told me that the heart is not present in the deceased’s body and therefore, when the heart was taken out, he could see that the deceased was still alive.’ Yengwa told the hearing that the officer who arrested Chimboza at the scene found him chewing raw flesh and that Manona's neck had been 'half-eaten'. He added that his chest had a gaping hole in the left side. However, Chimboza, originally from Zimbabwe, is now disputing the veracity of his statement, arguing that it was fabricated after he was assaulted by the police, according to Sowetanlive.com. Chimboza, who runs a window-tinting business, claims that while he did stab Manona to death, he can’t remember taking out the heart and eating it. The brutal attack took place on the evening of June 10. Counter argument: Chimboza, who runs a window-tinting business, now claims that while he did stab Manona to death, he can’t remember taking out the heart and eating it Chimboza confirmed to the hearing that Manona had called him certain names, that they then fought and that he had stabbed him to death. He said: ‘The way I was continuously stabbing, that must have ripped his heart out. Because I was in a shocked state.’ Geyer retorted: ‘All the witnesses that were there confirm you killed the deceased, you cut out his heart and ate it. They say there was flesh in your teeth and dry blood on your mouth.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."

The source later confirmed that at least one of the websites examined by authorities was a pornographic site. It's possible the body parts all came from the same dismembered victim, Lafreniere said, but police are still awaiting the results of forensic testing for confirmation. ""The two parts of the body that were found in Ottawa ... we've got all the reasons to believe that it's linked to our homicide,"" he added, referring to the human torso found in Montreal. Authorities said they are asking the public for help in locating Magnotta, after a ""coast-to-coast"" warrant was issued for his arrest. Police say they plan to charge him with murder once he's apprehended. Lafreniere said authorities have also found other body parts, potentially from the same attack, which is believed to have been committed in Montreal. It would be the 11th homicide there this year. ""It wasn't a random attack,"" Lafreniere said. ""They knew each other."" Lafreniere added that Magnotta had been ""involved in some stuff on the Web, that's for sure,"" though he would not elaborate. The human foot was sent to the Conservative Party of Canada headquarters in Ottawa, prompting a hazardous materials team to investigate. The officers who responded noticed what appeared to be bloodstains on the box, police said. Ottawa police Sgt. Steve Hodgson told reporters outside the office that the package had been addressed to the Conservative Party. Staffers had begun to open the package before calling police, he said. The hand was intercepted by workers at a Montreal postal terminal. Ottawa's major-crimes unit is checking with other police departments for similar cases and looking back through missing-persons files for any clues, according to Constable Marc Soucy, an Ottawa police spokesman. ""We're going to look at every avenue,"" he said. In Montreal, the human torso was found behind an apartment building, authorities said."

Galliano, who was fired by fashion giant Christian Dior in March after video surfaced showing him praising Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, testified Wednesday that drugs were to blame. Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud read out a list of the abuse Galliano is accused of hurling at Geraldine Bloch and Philippe Virgitti, including obscenities mixed with remarks about their ethnic backgrounds. ""He said 'dirty whore' at least a thousand times,"" the judge said. Galliano said on the witness stand that he had no memory of making the comments. Asked to explain his ""lack of memory,"" he said: ""I have an addiction. I am currently undergoing treatment."" Galliano's attorney said before the trial began the designer ""was a sick person, who was suffering from addiction and this is something we are demonstrating through medical evidence, expert reports."" ""We must not judge a man who for 30 years has been dedicated to diversity, who has been a loving person for all races, cultures and religions ... based on 40 minutes where he was sick through alcohol and medication,"" Aurelien Hamelle said. Galliano testified that he suffered from an increasing workload and no time to mourn after the 2007 death of his alter ego at Dior, designer Steven Robinson. ""With his death, I found I had no protection,"" Galliano said. His body became dependent on drugs, he said. ""I was taking sleeping pills during the day,"" he testified.   ""I've only just discovered since rehab what a lethal mix I was taking."" Bloch testified Wednesday that she encountered Galliano on a crowded cafe terrace, which led to an angry exchange. ""I don't remember his exact wording; there were different phrases,"" Bloch told the court.  ""It's true that I was angry. I insulted him, too."" Virgitti testified the confrontation, which he called ""just an argument in a bar,"" began when Galliano sat down next to his party at the cafe. ""He started speaking to us very quickly after arriving,"" Virgitti said. ""He told Geraldine to speak less as she was disturbing him. We didn't know what to do. The situation got worse. He started touching her hair, saying she had no hair.  I told him, 'Don't touch her.' "" He acknowledged during his testimony that while Galliano ""said things he shouldn't have,"" the incident ""has been so overly played out in the media."" Galliano faces a six-month jail term and a fine of 22,500 euros ($32,410) if he is convicted, according to prosecutors. A verdict in the case did not come Wednesday. Galliano will be judged in one trial over two separate incidents, one in October and one in February. After the second incident, Galliano was taken to a police station where a test revealed he had a high level of alcohol in his blood, authorities said at the time. He was later released. The video is from yet another incident. He is not being tried for the incident because the couple involved chose not to press charges. ""I love Hitler,"" Galliano said in a video obtained by Britain's Sun newspaper. ""Your mother, your forefathers would be f---ing gassed and f---ing dead."" Christian Dior condemned his ""deeply offensive statements and conduct."" French law prohibits the incitement of racial discrimination, hatred or violence based on a person's origin or their membership -- or nonmembership -- in an ethic, national, racial or religious group. Galliano apologized after the video was released. ""I only have myself to blame and I know that I must face up to my own failures and that I must work hard to gain people's understanding and compassion,"" Galliano said in a statement. ""Anti-Semitism and racism have no part in our society."" Galliano has kept a low profile since his firing, but Vanessa Friedman, fashion editor of the Financial Times newspaper, said that given time, he could return to the industry. His career is over in its present form, she said. But he could return to Britain, where there is ""residual love for him,"" lay low and make a comeback in a few years, she said. ""People love a redemption story,"" Friedman said. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne, Catherine Clifford and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report."

Last month, a judge ordered Spears, 25, to submit to random drug tests after finding she engaged in ""habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol."" That order, also by Gordon, provided no details and did not name any drugs. The former couple has been embroiled in a bitter custody fight over their sons, Sean Preston and Jayden.

He also barred the exes from making ""derogatory remarks about the other party and the other party's family or significant other"" during the case.

Lemaitre, the first white man to break the 10-second barrier over 100 meters last month, helped his 4x100m relay team to triumph in Barcelona and add to the 20-year-old's double in the individual sprints. Martial Mbandjock, who had earlier won two bronzes behind his teammate, snatched victory on the final leg as Italy were beaten back into second with Germany third. France's women's 4x100m team finished second behind shock winners Ukraine, who set the fastest time this year of 42.29 seconds. Poland denied the favored Russians a medal, but their larger neighbors won both the men's and women's 4x400m relay events as they finished with a total of 10 golds and 24 podium placings -- six more than France. Distance double for Britain's Farah Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad and Bouabdallah Tahri gave France a 1-2 in the men's 3000m steeplechase as Spain's Jose Luis Blanco took bronze. The hosts ended the competition in sixth place with two golds and eight medals overall after Nuria Fernandez and Natalia Rodriguez finished first and second in the women's 1,500m ahead of third-placed French runner Hind Dehiba, while Russian favorite Anna Alminova was back in sixth. Alemitu Bekele denied Turkey teammate Elvan Abeylegesse a 5,000m-10,000m double after passing the tiring former world record-holder on the home straight in the shorter distance, with Portugal's Sara Moreira third. Sprint double for Lemaitre In the women's high jump, Croatia's two-time world champion Blanka Vlasic won with a late leap of 2.03m to head off Sweden's Emma Green and Germany's Ariane Friedrich. Germany's Christian Reif won the men's long jump with this year's leading mark of 8.47m to comfortably beat France's Kafetien Gomis and Britain's Chris Tomlinson. The British team finished third overall with six golds and 19 medals in total, a record for the team, after also taking silver in the men's 4x400m and bronze in the women's event. Lemaitre claims 100m gold in Barcelona Poland's Piotr Malachowski won the men's discus from Germany's Robert Harting and Robert Fazekas of Hungary, while Switzerland finally won a medal after Victor Rothlin won the men's marathon in a time of two hours and 15.31 minutes to comfortably head off Spain's Chema Martinez and Russia's Dmitriy Safronov.

The 87-year-old monarch conducted 341 official visits, ceremonies, audiences and investitures over the last 12 months, compared to 425 in 2012 - a drop of about 20 per cent. Although the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 kept her busier than usual, her 2013 diary was noticeably slimmer than the 370 engagements she undertook in 2011 and the 444 in 2010. The last time she fulfilled foreign duties was in 2011. The Queen’s workload is still prodigious, particularly for a woman two decades over the average age of retirement. Indeed, based on these latest figures she still carries out engagements at a rate of almost one a day - in addition to the many hours she spends dealing with the red boxes full of official papers every day of the year except Christmas Day. Buckingham Palace has always been at pains to deny any suggestion that the head of state is plans to abdicate or even semi-retire in favour of her eldest son, Prince Charles. He turned 65 in November and is the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. However the latest tally is a sign that the Queen is, inevitably, slowing down. Earlier this year, palace officials were forced to announce what many royal watchers had known for some time - that the Queen had decided to completely scale back on her long-haul foreign travel. In November Charles attended the bi-annual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka on behalf of his mother for the first time in her six decade reign. Indeed, the last time the Queen undertook any foreign engagement was back in 2011 - although it is very likely she will attend the 70th anniversary commemorations of the Normandy Landings in France next year. Back at home, Prince Charles, Princess Anne and now even her grand-son, Prince William, are taking on more of her physically strenuous duties such as investitures, which require the Queen to stand on her feet, pinning on medals and wielding her father’s sword, for more than an hour at a time. A senior royal source told the Mail: ‘The simple truth is that the Queen is simply unable to keep working at the same pace she has done for the last 60 years. More duties: Prince Charles and Princess Anne are taking on more of the Queen's physically demanding roles ‘She isn’t retiring, she isn’t taking it easy, but she is scaling back some of her more strenuous duties.’Michael Ellis, the chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, who organised the commission of a special stained glass window in Westminster Hall to mark the event, also insisted that she was not scaling back her duties. ‘On the contrary, the fact that at age 87 she is still carrying out 341 official duties shows that Her Majesty continues to be highly devoted to her role as our Queen and I believe that she will continue in that role for many years to come,’ he said. ‘She works her way through reams of papers, she undertakes numerous audiences and she remains an example of duty and service to this country.’ The Queen’s 92-year-old husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, has also seen a reduction in his workload. In 2012 he conducted 325 official engagements, which fell to fewer than 200 this past year. This is largely due to an extensive period of convalescence following surgery earlier this year. Passing the baton: Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge have also taken on events, though fewer as they are not full-time royals Charles was the busiest member of the Royal Family with more than 500 official engagements under his belt, followed by Princess Anne. Last week the prince was named by a Danish newspaper as the hardest working member of any Royal Family in Europe. At the bottom of the list are the youngest royals, Prince William, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge. The brothers carried out just over 50 engagements each, but this is due to the fact that both had full-time jobs in the military and are not classed as full-time working royals. Prince Harry also undertook a four-month posting in Afghanistan and a four-week charity trek to the South Pole. Kate, 31, undertook just 43 engagements, but her staff have always insisted she does not want to be a full-time working royal either. She went on maternity leave in June in advance of the birth of her first baby, Prince George, the following month."

She has also reportedly been given compassionate leave from work to consider her future and has cut an increasingly wan figure as the separation continues. By contrast, her erstwhile beau appears to have been having the time of his life in Memphis, where his best friend Guy Pelly married American socialite, Lizzy Wilson on Saturday. The prince, who was seen ‘twerking’ on the dance floor, was having such a good time at the ‘unbelievably wild’ party that he made the band play five encores as he kept the party going beyond the 1am finish time. And while his brother dominated the dancefloor, it was William who jumped on the stage singing the Isley Brothers’ Shout.

There were just so many, he was surrounded. ‘There were so many packed in around him you couldn’t tell if he was with one girl or 20 girls. ‘You think of royalty as being stuffy, but they were loose. At the end when we finished Harry came up to the stage and asked if we would play another song as he did not want the night to end. We ended up doing five encores.’ Mr Church said guests began crowd surfing as his band played: ‘I’ve been doing this 50 years and I ain’t ever seen anything like this. These guys know how to party.’ He added: ‘William came up to me and gave me a hug and said that he wants me to come to London. It was the highlight of my life.’ The wedding came at the end of three days of celebrations that included a visit to Graceland, Elvis Presley’s mansion. On Thursday night after arriving in town, the guests enjoyed ribs at a barbecue restaurant before some, including Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, partied into the night on Beale Street, the city’s iconic main strip. Before arriving in Memphis, Harry stopped off in Miami where he was seen dancing in a nightclub into the early hours. Cressida, meanwhile, remained at home alone.

The PlayStation 4 console is set to be unveiled in New York at 11pm tonight. The struggling electronics giant hopes the next generation console will help it regain market share against Microsoft, who is yet to reveal plans for its new Xbox console - which is also expected to be on sale in time for Christmas. Touch me: This apparently leaked image purports to show the controller for the hotly anticipated PlayStation 4, which Sony is expected to announce at an event to be held in New York City next Wednesday Although no details have been confirmed by Sony, the PS4's main features are believed to include: The unveiling will excite millions of computer games fans across the world, and further fuel the on-going battle between Sony, Xbox 360 manufacturers Microsoft and Nintendo, the makers of the Wii system. Experts say the event is critical to Sony's future. 'For Sony, they have to come out and make this PlayStation event the definitive statement of why gamers need to adopt the PlayStation 4 or PlayStation Orbis or whatever they end up calling it,' said Greg Miller, PlayStation executive editor at video game site IGN.com. 'Their focus is on establishing a beachhead for the next generation of consoles, and that's what Feb. 20 is all about,"" said P.J. McNealy, CEO and founder of Digital World Research. 'The reality is they have been playing catch-up.' Since the first PlayStation console launched in December 1994, Sony have sold over 310 million home consoles worldwide, and 2.9 billion games. Pictures allegedly showing the new PS4 controller reveal the device will incorporate a touchscreen built into the middle of the familiar DualShock layout. It has also been rumoured the console will cost £270 in an attempt to undercut rivals. Electronics giant Sony is holding an event in New York, during which it promised to reveal 'the future'. But the games manufacturer has refused to confirm widespread rumours that the latest version of the console will be launched. Leaked photographs which have emerged online appear to show a prototype controller with a touchpad alongside the classic DualShock-style controls have fuelled the speculation. The touchscreen is at the front, where the start and select buttons are found on the current generation of PlayStation controllers. The image appears to back up rumours circulating earlier this week which added L2 and R2 buttons have also been remodelled and improved. Pushing ahead of Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo Co Ltd's new Wii U could help Sony revive an electronics business hurt by a dearth of hit gadgets, a collapse in TV sales and the convergence of consumer interest around tablets and smartphones built by rivals Apple and Samsung. Tablets and smartphones already account for around 10 percent of the $80 billion gaming market. Those mobile devices, analysts predict, will within a few years be as powerful as the current slew of game-only consoles. Sony has slashed the price of its struggling Vita handheld games console in Japan in a bid to spur sales of the device. The maker of Playstation consoles trimmed the price of its 3G Wifi version by 10,000 yen ($110) to 19,980 yen, with all other models also reduced, it said in a statement. Sony this month trimmed its forecast for handheld sales, including the Vita and older PSP, to 7 million machines in the year ending March 31 compared with an estimate of 16 million at the start of the business term. Sony has kept its cards close to its chest regarding the expected launch, so far only officially releasing a teaser video via YouTube announcing date of the event and calling on gamers to 'be the first to know'. The video also promoted a Twitter hashtag, #Playstation2013, to which video game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming event. Asked about the purpose of the event, Masaki Tsukakoshi, a spokesman for the company said only: 'We will be talking about the PlayStation business.' Tantalising: A still from Sony's teaser video, published on YouTube on January 31, announcing the date of its event on 'the future of the Playstation' to be held in New York City next week Console rival Microsoft is also believed to be gearing to launch its successor to the Xbox 360, which is codenamed Xbox Infinity, though it is understood the Windows giant is likely to delay announcement of the machine until the E3 show in June. Observers expect both systems to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony as their next-generation consoles go head-to-head in the vital holiday season market. Due for an update: Microsoft is expected to announce the successor to its Xbox 360 console at June's E3, in time for a Christmas launch date It has been more than six years since Sony launched the 70million-selling PS3, a longer gap than between it and its PS2 predecessor, adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept. The last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011, it presented a protoype of its handheld Vita console. Before that, it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the PS3 concept. A meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the PS2. Rumours surfaced last week that the new machine would be heavily focused on the cloud, which would put the Japanese firm's purchase last year of a leading cloud-based gaming company into perspective. Sony paid $380million for Gaikai in June last year. At the time Sony's chief executive, Andrew House, said: 'By combining Gaikai's resources including its technological strength and engineering talent with SCE's [Sony Computer Entertainment] extensive game platform knowledge and experience, SCE will provide users with unparalleled cloud entertainment experiences. 'SCE will deliver a world-class cloud-streaming service that allows users to instantly enjoy a broad array of content ranging from immersive core games with rich graphics to casual content anytime, anywhere on a variety of internet-connected devices.' The PlayStation Vita: The portable console, successor to the PSP, was unveiled the last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011 As well as the touchpad controller, the new console is expected to have an eight-core x64 AMD processor (codenamed 'Bulldozer), 8GB of RAM, 2.2GB of video RAM, four USB ports that use the new high-speed USB 3.0 standard, a Blu-ray drive, a hard drive of 160GB, an Ethernet port, and both HDMI and optical outputs. Specs for the next-generation Xbox are rumored to be comparable, with insiders suggesting that it will also pack 8GB of RAM, HDMI connectors and USB 3.0. However, video gamers have been horrified by rumours that the Microsoft machine will only work with the Kinect sensor plugged in and that it will only run games registered to the machine - potentially blocking not only second-hand games but also games borrowed from friends. The co-founder of Xbox has launched a scathing attack on Microsoft for 'five years of failure' - and claimed that Apple could ‘kill them’ at any given moment. Former Xbox engineer Nat Brown - who came up with the console’s name (albeit spelled xBox) - slammed Microsoft for failing to capitalise on innovations such as Kinect and making it difficult for developers to make and sell games on the device. The attack follows reports that Microsoft are likely to announce their Xbox 360 successor, codenamed Durango, at E3 in Los Angeles in June this year. Writing on his blog ilike.code, under the title ‘Stupid, Stupid xBox’, Brown said: ‘The past 5 years, and the last year in particular, have been simply painful to watch. 'Coasting on past momentum. Failing to innovate and failing to capitalize on innovations like Kinect. Touting strategic and market success when you’re just experiencing your competitor’s stumbling failure (yes, Sony, Nintendo – you are, I’m afraid, stumbling failures). 'A complete lack of tactical versus strategic understanding of the long game of the living room.’ The Playstation 4 could cost as little as £270 when it launches later this year, according to a report in a Japanese newspaper. The Asahi Shimbun reported that Sony's new gaming console will cost 40,000 Yen - which translates to about £270. However, UK gamers will have to factor in VAT, which adds a whopping 20 per cent to the price, taking the possible UK figure to around £325. Even at that price, the PS4 will be a bargain.The PS3 cost 60,000 Yen when it launched in Japan 2006. The new console is expected to be announced at a press conference in New York on February 20. If the price is as low as the rumours suggest, it could steal a march on Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console, which doesn't yet have a launch date. Microsoft's console, which could be named the Xbox 720,  could be announced at the annual E3 gaming conference, held in Los Angeles in June. Observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for Christmas, which could mean a battle for supremacy between Microsoft and Sony. The launches are important for both companies, as gamers have moved away from consoles since the Xbox 360 and the PS3 débuted. More and more people have shifted to tablets and smartphones as a gaming platform. Analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games consoles within a few years. Many are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs. Last hurrah: The Garnet Red PS3. Sony are still actively marketing the console, and are releasing it in two different colours tomorrow Azurite Blue: The 500GB 'super-slim' units may represent one last push of their current gen hardware Despite next-gen rumours and stiff competition from mobile devices, Sony are still actively marketing the Playstation 3. The company today released the console in two different colours. The new limited edition Garnet Red and Azurite Blue 500GB 'super-slim' units seem to represent one last push of their current generation hardware."

Peter Jee 38, who was a Greater Manchester Police sergeant at the time, committed the crime after she dialled 999 and he drove her home. Jee was one of three officers responding to the call from the confused woman who was threatening to take her own life. Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court was told she had taken a mix of drink and medication and just wanted police to take her home. Having satisfied themselves that she was in no danger, the officers had left her house in Rochdale. But Jee returned, minutes later, when he was sure his two colleagues had driven off and got the woman to perform a sex act on him as he fondled her. He was caught out after making what he thought had been discreet admissions to three colleagues - and from DNA found at the scene. The court was told that at first he denied he had even gone back to the house, and later claimed his victim had ‘come on’ to him. After the woman made an official complaint, Jee used police computer equipment to see how close he was to being arrested. Jee, who is married with children, later sent a text message to a colleague saying: 'I’m going to resign. It’s all my fault.' Jailing him, Judge Timothy Mort said: 'You went to this address as a serving police officer in uniform, with a very high degree of trust placed in you. Vulnerable: The woman had dialled 999 and had taken drugs and been drinking before Jee accosted her 'You abused that trust to take advantage of her vulnerability to satisfy your own sexual needs, and you realised that you might be able to get away with it because of your position.' Jee - who was in the top three per cent in the country in his sergeant’s exams - had been arrested on suspicion of rape, but the Crown later accepted a guilty plea to a charge of misconduct in public office. His victim was described as having a bi-polar illness, which can make her appear at times elated, or in a low mood. Alcohol complicated her symptoms. When officers arrived she was drunk, was slurring her words, and couldn’t walk without stumbling. When asked why she had not made an immediate complaint, she said: 'Who would have believed me?' His victim told police that the incident had had a significant impact on her life, she suffered panic attacks, and she could no longer trust police officers. Michael Lavery, defending, said Jee’s greatest shame had been to have been arrested in front of his family. His main concern now was the impact on his children. Judge Mort added: 'What possessed you to go back to the address I just don’t know. You knew there were problems, and it should have been a clear red traffic light.' Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, said: 'Jee’s inexcusable actions let everyone down: those that we protect and those that work selflessly to deliver policing across Greater Manchester. The sentence given sends out a clear message that society expects the highest standards from those who have a duty to protect them.'"

It will be a big test. ‘I am excited to play in it. It will be a good game, Scotland are doing well and getting some good results. ‘I have played here before in the Champions League and the atmosphere is really loud andintense. It’s a stadium with a particular atmosphere you want to experience as a player. ‘We have to play the game within the rules. I don’t think it will be like the games 20 years ago. ‘There will be an edge to it, but that’s what you expect from this kind of fixture. Everyone knows this stadium, the fans here have a great reputation of making it an intimidating place to come. I want to make sure they (the younger players) are ready. I wanted to pass on my experience.’ Gary Cahill, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck and Rooney could be the only survivors from the side that won England’s previous game against Scotland, a 3-2 victory at Wembley last August. Rooney added: ‘Our next game is in March so we don’t want to come off a bad result. We went to end the year on a high.’ Scotland boss Gordon Strachan is fully aware of the significance of the fixture to his players and when asked about the strength of his team said: ‘Nobody wants to be rested, that’s for sure. If we were playing some team 70-odd in the rankings, we would not be as excited.’ Hodgson expects a ‘strong’ Scotland to test his side. He said: ‘I’m not looking for excuses if we don’t win. If we don’t, it’s because we haven’t played well enough or they have been better.’ ‘Our approach to the game is exciting, it is a big game and we will be given a tough test.’ An empty Celtic Park may not look too intimidating, but England will find themselves in a hostile environment on Tuesday England's younger players, including Ross Barkley and Nathaniel Clyne (both centre) will be in for a big test, according to their captain More experienced players like Phil Jagielka (centre) and James Milner (2nd right) will have to help their younger team-mates The England manager looks focused as he strides out onto the Celtic Park pitch, with a banner behind him to remind Hodgson where he is"

The Hanscombe brothers from Beckenham, south-east London, all volunteered to fight in the war - and they were shot, gassed, blown up and taken prisoner in France, but all returned home alive. Their mother Sara - who was a widow when the war began in 1914 and also had a daughter - saw eight of her sons go off to the front line in Europe, while a ninth served in England. Hero family: Eight of the Hanscombe brothers were (from top left, clockwise) Frank, David, Stephen, George, Frederick, James, Bert and Joseph. Richard is not pictured, but their mother Sara can be seen above (centre) 'Gratified': This letter shows how King George V congratulated Mrs Hanscombe on her family's patriotism The men’s story has been compared to World War Two film Saving Private Ryan, which sees U.S. soldiers go behind enemy lines to retrieve a paratrooper whose three brothers have been killed. Speaking to journalist Sheron Boyle in the Sunday Mirror, the mother’s great-grandson Roy Hanscombe, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: ‘Saving Private Ryan was a very moving story. ‘But it has nothing on what my family endured. My grandfather, James, and his brothers survived the war but they didn’t escape unscathed, suffering a total of 21 wounds. ‘Many large families fought in the war but I have never heard of any where all survived - my great grandmother was lucky. Someone must have been looking down on her.’ One of nine brothers: Sergeant Bert Hanscombe won the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal Local hero: Bert Hanscombe worked as a council dustman and unveiled the Beckenham War Memorial in 1921 One of the brothers, Sergeant Bert Hanscombe, who won the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal, worked as a council dustman and unveiled his town’s war memorial in 1921. He was promoted to sergeant for his bravery at Hulluch during the Battle of Loos in France in 1915, and was one of seven men in his battalion to escape German capture at Cambrai two years later. Another brother, George, was a 36-year-old father-of-seven when the war began, and in 1917 he was listed as missing - but it turned out he had been shot in the hip and taken prisoner in Germany. James was wounded in the head in 1916 then again in 1917, but survived both attacks. And Richard was known for running messages to battalion headquarters at Nieppe Forest under heavy shellfire. War film: The men’s story has been compared to Saving Private Ryan, which sees U.S. soldiers go behind enemy lines in the Second World War to retrieve a paratrooper whose three brothers have been killed in action First World War: A file photograph of soldiers going 'over the top' during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 According to military expert Stuart Hallifax - who has researched the brothers - Mrs Hanscombe received a letter on behalf of King George V to thank her for the patriotic effort made by her family. And she said in a newspaper interview in 1918: ‘I never believed they would all come back’ However, Mr Hallifax wrote on his Great War London blog: ‘Sadly, Sarah Ann Hanscombe did not live to see her son acting as a local VIP in unveiling the local war memorial. She died in early 1920. ‘All of her sons who had served in the war survived it though. Unfortunately, David - who appears to have been the only one to remain a soldier - was killed in action in Waziristan in May 1922 though.’"

Open letter: Mr Stepashin has accused Barack Obama of generating a new Cold War to force Vladimir Putin out He added the White House was seeking to pull Europe into a conflict there, showing Mr Obama to be a ‘hawk who dresses up as a peacekeeper and can be called the father of the new Cold War’. It comes as Russia faces claims from Amnesty International that it lied to the world in denying its troops and weaponry were supporting rebels in Ukraine.

Now up for sale, Rookley Manor, near the village of Kings Somborne and the market town of Stockbridge, is just an hour by train from Winchester to London Waterloo. The brochure describes the property and surrounding grounds as an idyllic country pile, with golf courses nearby, racing at Salisbury and Newbury on offer, polo at Tidworth, point to point at Larkhill, motor racing at Thruxton, fishing at the Rivers Test and Itchen, and sailing on the south coast.

A Los Angeles judge refused a request to free the singer from custody on Wednesday so he could make his own way back from Washington. Brown, 24, was taken to Washington by U.S. marshals this month for trial on an assault charge, but that has been put on hold until the appeal of his bodyguard's conviction is completed. Brown has been on probation since 2009 when he pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge in the beating of his then-girlfriend Rihanna Fenty. He and bodyguard Christopher Hollosy were arrested on assault charges in Washington for allegedly beating a man who tried to take a photo of Brown last December. The arrest led to a revocation of Brown's probation, but he was allowed to enter a rehab program instead of going to jail. He was ordered to jail last month when he was kicked out of the rehab program for rules violations. Planes, chains and automobiles: Chris Brown's miserable trip to trial Brown is now ""stuck between a rock and a hard spot,"" attorney Robert Kalunian told Judge Victor Greenberg during a brief hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday. He has been locked up for 39 days and still has not had a probation revocation hearing, Kalunian said. Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray said she ""strenuously"" opposed releasing Brown now, arguing the only change since Brown was jailed in March is that his case has ""gotten worse."" The Washington judge who found his bodyguard guilty in the assault case also concluded that Brown was ""the initial aggressor"" in the incident, Murray said. A hearing was set for May 1 in Los Angeles to set a date for another hearing that could determine if Brown's Washington case warranted a probation revocation. It could be several months before his trial in Washington is held. ""I think it's a little over the top to have him in custody on this misdemeanor when everybody saw the bodyguard's trial and which was nothing more than a bloody nose,"" Brown lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters in Washington earlier Wednesday. ""And you have got the bodyguard who was convicted and who readily admitted he was the one who did the punching.Â So all of this is much ado about nothing."" Chris Brown's freedom at stake with 2 cases The delay in Brown's Washington trial came after prosecutors refused to grant immunity to Hollosy so he could testify without jeopardizing his own case. On Monday, Hollosy was found guilty of assaulting a man on a Washington sidewalk before Brown's trial was to begin in the case. The prosecutors cited Hollosy's refusal to talk to them about his testimony as a major reason for the decision not to grant immunity. Their motion also said they suspected he might lie in his testimony to help Brown. ""The cynic in me would say apparently it is not a search for the truth because if they wanted the truth they would give Hollosy immunity and allow him to testify,"" Geragos said Wednesday outside court. CNN's Paul Courson and Sunny Hostin contributed to this report."

Accused: Torrington High School football players Edgar Gonzalez, pictured left, and Joan Toribio, right. both 18, are accused of felony second-degree sexual assault and other crimes The victim has been called a 'whore,' criticized for 'snitching' and blamed for 'ruining' the lives of the popular players. One Twitter user wrote: 'Young girls acting like whores there's no punishment for that young boys acting like boys is a sentence.' After The Register Citizen published his tweet, the same user said on Twitter that he 'would tweet the same exact thing about what happened in Ohio, not that the girls aren't victims my point is.' Another bully tweeted: 'Even if it was all his fault, what was a 13-year-old girl doing hanging around 18 year old guys..' The tweet was reposted 11 times and received six favorites. A judge has ordered details of the Connecticut allegations to be sealed from public view. This tends to happen in the state when a case is still under investigation, and when a young victim is involved. The warrants will remain sealed for 15 days at which point a hearing will be held to decide whether the details will be made public, according to the Citizen. Bullying: The victim has been bullied on social media after the allegations against Toribio, pictured, and Gonzalez Sealed: Details of the allegations against the two friends have been sealed from public view The case mirrors one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week of raping a girl who was later threatened online. Gonzalez and three other Torrington football players were also embroiled in a hazing scandal last year that is still under investigation, according to the Citizen. Gonzalez, who was named the team's Most Valuable Player, was charged in a March 2012 alleged felony robbery after he and three others allegedly jumped three 14-year-olds in search of money. Jeffrey Holder, 19, a former Torrington High School football player, was also charged but the other two co-conspirators were not identified because of their age. Gonzalez has pleaded not guilty in that case. Former Head Coach Dan Dunaj, who resigned in December, allowed Gonzalez to play in 2012, despite the charges. He told the Citizen he 'reeled the kid in' when he became aware of the pending robbery charges against Gonzalez 'and he walked the line. As a coach I was doing something right.'

'My process has always been like this, and I learned this from my high school coach, and I never got into any big trouble, thank God, but if you didn't give the kid a chance then who's going to,' Dunaj told the newspaper. Torrington athletics director has insisted the incidents are isolated and not indicative of a sordid culture within the football team. Athletic Director Mike McKenna told the Citizen: 'If you think there's some wild band of athletes that are wandering around then I think you're mistaken.' According to McKenna, a student athlete would be suspended from play for a 'serious infraction.' However, he couldn't say whether a felony or a misdemeanor would be enough.

In Steubenville, head coach Reno Saccoccia may face charges for his failure to report the shocking rape by quarterback Trent Mays, 17, and wide receiver Ma'lik Richmond, 16. He allegedly told the two star players that he'd 'make it go away,' referring to the allegations, rather than telling police. Both cases have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools. A comment on the Citizen's story reads: 'The power of the football team. Be a good athlete and you can do no wrong.' The victim in the Ohio case has been viciously tormented on social media by other teens. Yesterday it emerged that two girls, aged 15 and 16, who are facing charges for allegedly issuing death threats to the girl will stay in custody pending trial to protect the victim. Toribio is scheduled to be in court April 23. Gonzalez is scheduled to be back in court on April 2."

The primary cast of the film, as well as director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and book author Veronica Roth, spoke about the film's potential as the so-called next ""Hunger Games"" and offered hints about what's to come from the franchise. The futuristic film stars Shailene Woodley as a teenager named Tris who is forced to decide between the societal faction her family belongs to and the one she feels is right for her. It will be released in theaters on March 21, 2014. Woodley, who finished filming only two days prior to Comic-Con, is already preparing for the wash of fame that will follow should the movie be a success. Harrison Ford talks 'Ender's Game' ""I did audition for 'The Hunger Games' back in the day,"" Woodley told reporters at a press conference on Thursday, July 18. ""Jennifer Lawrence actually helped me with 'Divergent' because I asked her to tell me how her life has changed from going from small indie movies to something as big as 'Hunger Games.' And she gave me really beautiful advice saying how much she appreciated it and how much it's changed her life in positive ways. She really helped me on this journey."" The actress cited filming the book's integral scene on Chicago's famous Navy Pier -- Ferris wheel as her favorite moment in the film -- as well as one of her favorite moments in her life. The big-budget, action-based picture is a far cry from some of Woodley's previous roles, which include ""The Descendents"" and next month's ""The Spectacular Now."" For the actress and her co-stars, many of whom are largely unknown actors, ""Divergent"" was a chance to experience new methods of filmmaking. ""Green-screen acting is by far way more difficult than human interaction,"" Woodley said. ""I'd never done a movie of this scale before with themes that are somewhat different than the world we live in today. So it was challenging for me I found because I had to erase my previous notions of acting, which is generally reacting off of somebody else, and create a new world and adapt my style of artistry to what we were doing."" An adaptation of the series' second book, ""Insurgent,"" is expected for 2015. Roth said she has been present on set and feels that the film remains true to her original text. The author confirmed that the final book, ""Allegiant,"" will be written from two perspectives: Tris and her love interest Four, who is played in the film by Theo James. But since the third book in the series will be released October 22, 2013, the actors and filmmakers still don't know the final fate of the characters. ""Not everyone on this panel lives,"" said Miles Teller, who plays Peter, as he motioned to the 10 cast members at the press conference. ""But I'm excited."" 'Kick-Ass 2': Not your average sequel"

Nidal Hasan has replaced his lead defense attorney, John Galligan, it was revealed Wednesday. Galligan, the former Army lawyer who has been the lead attorney for Hasan since nearly the beginning of the case, was not present at Hasan's arraignment Wednesday at Fort Hood. It is unclear why Galligan was ousted. The judge in the case asked Hasan if he had removed Galligan voluntarily and without outside pressure, and Hasan said, ""Yes."" The only other thing Hasan said in court was the names of his current lawyers: Col. Chris Poppe, Maj. Christopher Martin and Capt. Justin Oshana. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist of Muslim background, is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in November 2009. Galligan had fought the Department of Defense for months to make sure his client gets a fair trial. He tried to get the Army to take the possibility of a death sentence off the table. But when Fort Hood Cmdr. Gen. Donald Campbell ordered that Hasan face general court-martial, he also ruled that Hasan would face possible execution if found guilty. Galligan issued a statement referring to his departure as a ""leave of absence,"" but giving no details of why he is leaving the defense team. ""I have consistently argued that Major Hasan has not been treated fairly. I maintain that belief. As such, I deeply regret that my presence on the Defense Team has been interrupted. However, Major Hasan fully understands that I stand ready and anxious to resume an active role."" Galligan also said he and his family have been vilified for defending Hasan. In a telephone interview with CNN, Galligan maintained that he was not fired from the defense team. He was only released and he may be back, he said. However, Galligan would provide no reason for his removal other than to say it had nothing to do with his health or the fact that his family has been attacked. Galligan went on to say there are a lot of issues: ""Stay tuned."" Other than the change of attorneys, the arraignment was formal and quick. Hasan's new lead attorney Poppe said they wished to defer entering a plea or any new motions in the case. Hasan did not have the option of pleading guilty. When a person faces a possible death penalty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the law prohibits a guilty plea. The judge set a trial date of March 5, 2012. Hasan appeared in court in standard-issue Army camouflage fatigues. The rest of the officers involved in the case have been ordered to wear more formal Army dress uniforms during hearings and the trial. He appeared alert during the proceeding, speaking frequently to Poppe. Witnesses at a preliminary hearing have identified Hasan as the man who walked calmly through a medical building on the country's largest military base, shooting and frequently reloading his handgun as he shouted ""Allah Akbar,"" which means ""God is great"" in Arabic. Hasan was shot by Fort Hood police officers and has been paralyzed from the center of his chest down since the attack. He now uses a wheelchair. Aside from protecting Hasan's rights, Galligan has fought to get him proper medical treatment while he awaits trial. For example, it took a lot of time just to get a blanket to keep Hasan warm during hearings in the well-air-conditioned courtroom. When Hasan was brought into court on Wednesday, he had no blanket but was wearing an olive green stocking cap on his bald head. He took it off during the hearing and put it back on just before wheeling himself out of the courtroom."

That is preposterous and beside the point. The ACA is law. End of story. The House Republicans' attempt to nullify a duly-enacted law violates the norms of our constitutional system. It is reckless economically and an egregious affront to our democratic form of government. House Republicans have every right to press their views in Congress but not to threaten to blow up the U.S. and global economy by shutting down the government and threatening public default We have elections for all three key players -- the president, the House and the Senate. If Republicans want to change the law, they must do it the old-fashioned way: Persuade the others to accept their position or win control of the White House and Senate. House Republicans lost ground in the 2012 elections, lost the national vote for the House by over a million votes and retained a majority only because of favorable districting. Obama won re-election by 3.9 percentage points and got an overwhelming victory in the Electoral College. Senate Democrats retained their majority despite having to defend more than twice as many seats as the Republicans. House Republicans represent a distinct minority of public sentiment. They carelessly generalize from the echo chambers of their safe districts to the national electorate. Polls show a majority of the public opposed to shutting down the government to kill or amend Obamacare. A majority of Americans also oppose its repeal or defunding. Moreover, a significant portion of those who don't like the law say it doesn't go far enough. But public opinion doesn't matter at this point. The Constitution provides for an orderly process of making laws and building agreement between chambers of Congress and branches of government. Blackmail, extortion, hostage-taking and brinksmanship are the tools of terrorists, not legislators. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Mann."

Timothy Geithner has been nominated for the post of treasury secretary in the Obama administration. The Geithners employed a housekeeper whose employment authorization document expired about three months before she stopped working for them in October 2005, according to a written statement from the Senate Finance Committee. Later, the housekeeper, who is married to a U.S. citizen, was granted a green card, transition officials said. The second concern involves Geithner's taxes while he worked for the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to a statement released by the committee, Geithner failed to pay self-employment taxes while the IMF paid him from 2001 to 2004. In 2006, the Internal Revenue Service audited Geithner for tax years 2003 and 2004, and he paid $16,732 for the taxes and interest for those years, the statement said. After Obama nominated him for treasury secretary, Geithner voluntarily amended his taxes for 2001 and 2002, paying $25,970 for those taxes and interest, the committee said. The presidential transition team told Finance Committee staff about Geithner's taxes early last month, the committee said. As an international organization, the IMF does not withhold money from employees' paychecks to pay Social Security and Medicare. U.S. employees are required to pay them on their own. Robert Gibbs, the incoming White House spokesman, called Geithner's tax issue a ""common mistake."" ""The president-elect chose Tim Geithner to be his treasury secretary because he's the right person to help lead our economic recovery during these challenging times,"" Gibbs said in a written statement. ""He's dedicated his career to our country and served with honor, intelligence and distinction. That service should not be tarnished by honest mistakes, which, upon learning of them, he quickly addressed."" The Finance Committee said it would continue to review Geithner's tax returns and other information ahead of a nomination hearing. ""When errors or issues of concern are discovered, transparency is vital to allow members of the committee and the entire Senate to fully review and assess the relevant information before hearings and votes occur,"" the committee said. ""I believe that these errors, although serious, do not rise to the level of disqualification. He is an extremely competent man,"" said committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Montana. ""The errors were, in my judgment, honest mistakes. He did not in any way intentionally make those mistakes."" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, also said the mistakes were ""not at all disqualifying."" ""Tim came to the committee, admitted he had made some mistakes, and was very contrite,"" he said. ""I continue to strongly support his nomination and given the tough economic conditions, hope we can confirm him as quickly as possible."""

Getting them to eat pancakes is not nearly as difficult. Police in Westerville, Ohio, say a 37-year-old mother operating a day care out of her home hit upon a plan -- she allegedly crushed medications that cause drowsiness and put them in the pancakes. Tammy Eppley has been charged with six counts of child endangerment. Her first court date is July 12. Eppley, who runs the Caterpillar Clubhouse, cared for six children -- including one of her own -- between the ages of 2 and 5, police said. ""This is mortifying. I'm a very private person and I'm very protective of my children and the children in my care,"" she said. Investigators believe she used medications such as the allergy medicine Benadryl and supplements like melatonin to get the children to go to sleep, according to a statement from the Westerville Police. She would say something to the effect of ""I just gave them their nappy time medicine,"" Lt. Paul Scowden told CNN affiliate WCMH. None of the children suffered any illness or injury related to the alleged drugging incident. A former friend reported her to child protective services after she received a series of text messages from Eppley joking about sedating the kids. Eppley has denied the charges, claiming she was just venting in the texts. ""It was just any frustrated parent that would say when they were frustrated,"" she said. ""The kids are driving me crazy today, they're off the wall. I wish there was a drug like in sleeping beauty they would all just go to sleep.""

The 17-year-old Queenslander, Brock Giblin, was driving a Mazda 3 MPS when it rolled several times at Sydney Motorsport Park on Friday morning, a statement released by Shannons Australian Motor Racing Nationals said. Paramedics were called to Eastern Creek race track just before 11am to attend to the teenager who drives for Osborne Motorsport. But not before his 'brave' team mates, Ryan McLeod and Matt Cherry, attempted to help Giblin who was trapped inside the vehicle after the car flipped and burst into flames. Eventually he was freed by emergency service crews. Brock Giblin (right), was set to race with Nick Lange (left) in Sunday's Australian 4 Hour Race Osborne Motorsport owner Colin Osborne said Giblin had 'experienced significant burns' but was in a 'serious but stable' condition. 'At the present time, investigations at the hospital indicate that his burn injuries are the only area of concern,' he said in a statement. 'Brock is currently being readied for transfer to a specialist burns unit in Sydney.' Mr Osborne said the precise cause of the accident was under investigation but it was 'apparent' that fire the result of the accident not the cause. He is a Year 11 student at Maleny State High School on the Sunshine Coast and had just joined the racing team Giblin suffered burns to 70 per cent of his body when his car rolled several times at Sydney Motorsport Park He added: 'We are confident that the cars construction, safety devices and the drivers safety apparel did their job to restrict any further injuries to Brock.' Mr Osbourne said Giblin's father and team members were by the driver's bedside. 'Our thoughts are with Brock and his family at this time, and we hope for a quick recovery,' he said. 'The team has not yet decided if it will continue to participate in the Australian Manufacturers Championship round this weekend.'

Richard Craill, media manager for the Shannons Australian Motor Racing Nationals series, told Drive.com the car had just performed a 'super-fast turn' before it went up in flames. The teenager, from Landsborough on the Queensland's Sunshine Coast, joined the race team this year and is a Year 11 student at Maleny State High School.

The HMS Victory sank in 1744. The HMS Victory -- the predecessor to a historic British flagship of the same name -- was found ""far from where history says it was lost,"" Odyssey Marine Exploration said in a news release Monday. The find in the English Channel exonerates Adm. Sir John Balchin, one of ""the greatest admirals in English history,"" because it shows that the ship went down in a violent storm, not due to any mistakes he made, Odyssey said. It did not specify the ship's exact location. Maritime lore said the ship went down in the northern part of the Channel Islands, south of England near the coast of France. Stories about treasures -- including gold -- that may have been on the ship have existed ever since its disappearance. This HMS Victory was a predecessor to the historic British ship that took the same name and which served as Admiral Nelson's flagship in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. In court papers seeking exclusive salvage rights, Odyssey says the wreck site ""consists of cannons and other unidentified objects. Odyssey believes that potentially valuable cargo may be located at or near the site."" The papers were filed in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida, where Odyssey is based, seeking exclusive salvage rights. There were nearly 1,000 people aboard -- ""900 sailors, plus a complement of marines and 50 volunteers drawn from the noblest families of England,"" Odyssey said in information about the ship released together with the Discovery Channel, which chronicled the find. Based on reports from the time, there may be as much as four tons of gold on the ship, Odyssey and the Discovery Channel said. ""Additional research indicates that there were large quantities of both silver and gold coins aboard. ... Research suggests that this prize money will also likely be located at the wreck site. ""... However, no coins have been located at the site to date, and no accurate assessment as to their value can be made prior to location, recovery and analysis."" The potential treasure also comes in another form -- bronze weaponry. ""The site's anticipated ordnance collection"" includes ""the single largest collection of bronze cannon in the world"" and ""the largest consignment of bronze guns ever manufactured and preserved today,"" Odyssey said. Two cannons have been recovered -- ""a 12-pounder featuring the royal arms of George II"" and a ""42-pounder bearing the crest of George I,"" it said. ""The huge 42-pounder recovered is the only known example of a gun of this type and size currently in existence on dry land. The only other artifacts recovered to date were two small brick fragments that were brought into U.S. federal court in order to file an admiralty arrest of the site."" Admiralty arrest is a step mandated under international maritime law. The discovery could set up a legal battle with the British government. If it really is the HMS Victory, ""her remains are sovereign immune,"" the British Ministry of Defense (MOD) said in a statement on its blog Monday. ""The wreck remains the property of the Crown. We have not waived our rights to it. This means that no intrusive action may be taken without the express consent of the United Kingdom."" In its statement, Odyssey said it ""has been cooperating closely"" with the ministry, and ""all activities at the site have been conducted in accordance with protocols agreed with MOD and Royal Navy officials."" The ship has deteriorated to the point that recovering it is impossible, Odyssey said. ""A plan is being developed for an archaeological excavation of the site, and artifacts will be recovered in accordance with a scientific project plan, which will be submitted to the UK MOD for review and approval."" The company has proposed that it be paid ""with either ... a percentage of the value of the collection that has been recovered, conserved and presented to the UK government, or a percentage of the coins or other artifacts that the government decides to (sell)."" The ship was found nearly 100 km (62 miles) ""from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked on a reef near the Channel Islands,"" Odyssey's statement said. ""Having discovered it in deep water far from where history says it was lost has served to exonerate Admiral Balchin and his officers from the accusation of having let the ship run aground on the Casquets due to faulty navigation,"" said Greg Stemm, Odyssey's chief executive officer, in the statement. Odyssey said the ""prevailing belief"" about the ship's fate was that it had ""smashed into the Casquets, a group of rocky islets"" north of Guernsey, the second largest of the Channel Islands. But the evidence, Odyssey's statement said, suggests ""the ship sank as the result of a violent storm and suggests that the design and construction of the ship contributed to her loss."" Odyssey released press materials about the ship in cooperation with the Discovery Channel, which chronicled the find and will be showing it in a program this week called Treasure Quest. ""The English Channel is a treacherous place to navigate,"" Discovery Channel President John Ford told CNN Radio. ""The ship was returning from Portugal and got caught up in a storm. And despite being judged unsinkable at the time, sort of like the Titanic was, this very, very large ship went down in a storm and vanished without a trace.""

The episode dubbed Brick Like Me will be historic episode number 550 of what is now the longest running scripted series in television history. But it wasn't easy getting there. Is that you, Marge? A May 4 episode of The Simpsons puts America's favorite family into a LEGO-fied Springfield Very special: The episode is historic on many fronts. Not only will it be the 550th episode, but it will also rank as the most expensive half-hour Simpsons episode ever produced 'We've literally been at this thing for two years â€” twice the time it takes to do one of our regular episodes,' executive producer Matt Selman told TV Guide. The idea for the episode began with LEGO Group approaching Fox about creating a Simpson's character playset. LEGO's president of licensing Jill Wilfert told TV Guide that while merchandising was still being hashed out, the 80-year-old company suggested the show do a LEGO opening couch sequence. 'They quickly came back to us and said, 'Forget the couch; let's do an entire episode!'"" Wilfert said. It was the start of a delicate dance between two popular culture titans. 'We're pretty picky about how our brand is represented,' Wilfert said. 'No one at the show is used to dealing with creative input from the outside.' TV Guide's sneak peek of the May 4 episode revealed it to be a tamer offering than viewers are accustomed to from the series, but it did show LEGO showing more leg than usual. TV Guide writes: 'LEGO Homer and LEGO Marge get frisky and are clearly heading to the bedroom. Their afterglow scene, with LEGO arms, hands and feet pulled apart and scattered everywhere, is priceless.' The central character of the episode is Homer, who is excited when he first finds himself in LEGO world but later finds himself wonders if it's where he and his now-plastic family belong. What Homer decides had yet to be revealed, but the work put into the episode and the beloved status of both brands ensures the show will me a memorable one. 'At its core, the LEGO brand is all about creativity and imagination,' said Wilfert of the pairing. 'We respect that in others.' The historic episode was the result of a delicate dance between titans: the 82-year-old LEGOs brand and the longest-running scripted series in the history of television Playset: The show is also timed with the release of special edition collectible Simpsons LEGO men (and women and baby)"

A beatification Mass for Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich, who died in 1927, was led by Cardinal Angelo Amato at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark. Beatification is the third in a four-step process toward sainthood. Demjanovich is credited with curing a boy's macular degeneration in the 1960s, the Archdiocese of Newark says. The boy, Michael Mencer, was given a lock of the nun's hair and prayed to her. The effects of the eye disease soon began to fade, Roman Catholic Church officials say.

Mencer, who is now 58 and lives in Nebraska, and members of the Demjanovich family were among the hundreds of clergy members, nuns and worshippers who attended the beatification Mass. He said was happy that Demjanovich was getting the recognition she deserves. ""I was dug in thinking, this was going to take 100 years,"" he said. Mencer also reflected on the moment when he first realized his eyesight was improving. ""I was walking and I looked up, and I thought I was looking at the sun because at first it was just the light,"" he said. ""Then I was able to focus on the sphere and I thought `oh, that's the sun' but it didn't hurt, I didn't tear up or anything and then I looked back down and there it was, the hair."" Mencer said he returned home and handed the hair to his mother.

""I actually ran, it didn't dawn on me then. I just ran to my friend's house."" Mencer's younger brother, Mark, said he was thrilled to attend the Mass. ""This is something that's been in the making for decades,"" Mark Mencer said. ""My mother has been in contact with Rome for a long time. I'm glad to see such great success come from this."" Mark Mencer, who now lives in Las Vegas, said he was about 4 years old when his brother's vision began to improve. ""I heard the stories including the one of him walking into a tree because he couldn't see so well,"" he said. ""It's amazing because he had no medical intervention. It's a true miracle of God."" The beatification comes less than a year after Pope Francis certified Mencer's improved eyesight as a miracle, though church officials started the process in 1945 when the bishop of Paterson began studying Demjanovich's life and virtues, according to the Sisters of Charity. Demjanovich was born in Bayonne, southeast of Newark, and was a Sister of Charity for only two years before succumbing to complications of appendicitis at age 26. During her short time in the order, she was best known for her virtue and her mature writings. At the time, students also noted that whatever was said in confidence to her was not spoken to anyone else, Sister Diane Collesano said. 'The sisters saw in her that a person who had insights far beyond the average 20-some-year-old person,'Collesano said. Beatification requires evidence of one miracle that happened after the candidate has died and as a result of a specific plea to the candidate. Sainthood requires a second miracle, though candidates deemed martyrs need only one for canonization. Traditionally, beatifications have taken place in Rome. But several years ago, Pope Benedict XVI said beatifications could take place in the country and diocese from which the blessed person came.

The royal revelation, which followed months of tabloid speculation, came as Catherine was admitted to a central London hospital with acute morning sickness Monday afternoon. She is expected to be in King Edward VII Hospital for several days, the palace said. Acute morning sickness: What is it? The palace said her illness is hyperemesis gravidarum, which involves nausea and vomiting more severe than typical morning sickness. Prince William spent much of Monday with his wife at the hospital, the palace said, but he was seen leaving Monday evening. Read more: Who can inherit the British throne?

The Swedish 24-year-old felt a sharp pain in her ankle as she played at the a pre-qualifier for the ISPS Handa Australian Open at the Royal Canberra Golf Club in Yarralumla, Australia, yesterday. Iron will: Swedish amateur golfer Daniela Holmqvist in action in Morocco (left) and (right) lining up her drive on the 18th tee during the second round of the 2012 Ladies Norwegian Challenge Dangerous: Holmqvist was bitten by a Black widow spider, which secretes poison that can kill an adult in under an hour When the Stockholm native looked down she realised she'd been bitten by a deadly Black Widow spider. Holmqvist swatted the arachnid away, but before she knew it she was doubled over in pain, reports Eurosport. A Black Widow is so venomous that its bites can kill an adult in under an hour - children can die within 30 minutes if struck by the creatures, and the caddies were terrified by what might happen. Did the LPGA Tour rookie faint? Scream for an ambulance? Cry hysterically? No. While the panicked locals rushed around, Holmqvist, whose leg was already swelling up, calmly reached into her pocket, pulled out a golf tee and used it to gash open her bite and squeeze the venom out. 'When I told the local caddies in my group what had happened, they got very upset and said it was a Black Widow, and immediately started looking for their phones to call the medics,' Holmqvist told Svensk Golf. The Royal Canberra Golf Club in Yarralumla, Australia, where the hardy Swede was competing Amazingly, Holmqvist played on through her pain, shooting a 74 on the day. Medics followed her around the course to make sure she didn't pass out. She described the moment she bravely sliced open the infected wound. 'A clear fluid came out,' Holmqvist said. 'It wasn't the prettiest thing I've ever done, but I had to get as much of it out of me as possible.' 'It still hurts,' Holmqvist said last night. 'I don't recommend getting bitten by a black widow.' She joked about the incident on Twitter, calling herself 'Spider-woman'. Holmqvist joins the list of female sports stars who have grit their teeth and spectacularly played on through the pain. One such hardy soul is Kerri Strug, who severely sprained her ankle and damaged her tendons on the vault at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. With the team gymnastics gold medal on the line, Strug's coaches told her she'd have to jump again, not knowing that the score she'd received on the first vault had already guaranteed gold for the Americans. Limping as she walked to the runway, Strug nailed a two-foot landing, then quickly shifted her weight off her injured ankle as she raised her arms and saluted the judges. She had to be carried off the floor and on to the medal podium by her coach (right) and was honoured with a trip to the White House."

Mauro Chialli was one of eight jurors who on Monday ordered Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito be freed after acquitting them of charges that they sexually assaulted and murdered Meredith Kercher in 2007. Knox returned home to Seattle on Tuesday, and Sollecito to his home in southern Italy. Innocent: Mauro Chialli said he was determined Amanda Knox, left, and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, right, were telling the truth during the trial In an interview with Italy's state-run RAI television, Mr Chialli said he had spent a lot of time during the 10-month appeals trial reading the faces of Knox and Sollecito and determined they were telling the truth in insisting on their innocence. 'I saw the faces of these two kids, and they couldn't bluff. They didn't bluff. My point of view is that these kids weren't guilty. They weren't there,' he said. Knox and Sollecito were arrested a few days after Miss Kercher's body was discovered in a pool of blood on November 2 2007 in the apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia. Jailed: Rudy Hermann Guede was convicted in 2009 of Meredith Kercher's murder and had his 16-year prison sentence upheld by Italy's highest court They were convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively. A third defendant, Rudy Hermann Guede, was also convicted and had his 16-year prison sentence upheld by Italy's highest court. Following Monday's acquittals, Guede remains the only one in prison for the death. His lawyer has said he wants the case reopened, given that Italy's high court determined Guede did not act alone. Mr Chialli said there were several elements of the prosecution's case that did not convince him, primarily the lack of a motive and uncertainties about the precise time of Miss Kercher's death. Relief: Amanda Knox cries following the verdict that overturns her conviction and acquits her of murdering her British roomate 'What didn't convince me was that in the end, it was an accusation based on so many conjectures,' he said. 'It could have been this way, it could have been another way.' Knox and Sollecito maintain they were at Sollecito's apartment the night of the killing, smoking hashish, watching a film and having sex. Earlier in the week, the Italian judge who presided over the appeal, Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann, said the two were cleared of murder based on the evidence but that the real truth could be different. Justice: Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann during the appeal hearing. One of the jurors said he believes Knox and Sollecito were not 'bluffing'"

'Losing our mom, wife and grandmother has been one of the most difficult challenges any of us have faced in our lives,' the statement said. 'For her life to have been taken in such a tragic act of violence adds a depth of grief we are trying to comprehend.' At the church Friday, around a dozen mourners wore jerseys bearing the logos of the Oklahoma City Blazers and Barons as a tribute to Hufford, remembered as a regular patron, with her husband, of the city's minor league hockey teams. Former Blazers coach Doug Sauter was among those attending. 'She was loved and liked by everyone,' Sauter told The Oklahoman newspaper this week. 'They enjoyed the games so much.

Police this week arrested one of Hufford's co-workers, Alton Nolen, 30, after he was released from a hospital. Officers said the plant's chief operating officer, Mark Vaughan, who is also a reserve sheriff's deputy, shot Nolen with a rifle to stop him as he attacked Traci Johnson, 43, who had complained that Nolen had made racial remarks at work. Police said Vaughan Foods' human resources department suspended Nolen September 25 and that he went home, retrieved and knife and returned to the plant. According to an arrest affidavit, he attacked Hufford from behind, severing her head, and attacked Johnson, too, until Vaughan intervened. Prosecutors have filed paperwork saying they'll seek Nolen's execution if he's convicted. Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn has said he made that decision to seek the death penalty after meeting with Hufford's family.

Because the attack followed a series of high-profile videotaped beheadings by Islamic State militants in the Middle East, Moore police asked the FBI to help investigate. Friends started an online fundraising effort to help Hufford's family. As of Friday, people had pledged more than $8,400 toward the goal of $10,000. The Great Falls (Montana) Tribune and The Oklahoman reported this week that Hufford, then Colleen Thompson, was a 1978 graduate of Great Falls High School.

Jude Deveraux, who has had 30 books on the New York Times bestseller list, was in court in West Palm Beach, Florida on Tuesday at the criminal trial of her long-time clairvoyant Rose Marks. Ms Deveraux first sought the help of Marks in the 1990s following the death of her eight-year-old son in a motorcycle accident and in the midst of a painful divorce. Scammed: Multimillionaire author Jude Deveraux testified in Florida last September that a clairvoyant she trusted stole millions from her Fraudster: Nancy Marks, who operated under the name of Joyce Michaels, allegedly preyed on people's weaknesses to make money from them The 65-year-old author said at the time she met Marks, whom she knew as Joyce Michaels, she was suicidal and trying to get out of a 'horrible, terrible' marriage, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Ms Deveraux told the court that she did not believe in psychic powers but was really looking for someone to listen to her problems. She met Marks for the first time in a studio in midtown Manhattan where the psychic claimed to work from a 'special room' in St Patrick's Cathedral on 5th Avenue. After several meetings, Marks told the writer that she would help her achieve a 'peaceful divorce' - for a fee of $1,200. Although the author did not believe in Marks' psychic powers, she came to trust her after several of her prophecies appeared to come true. Marks managed to accurately predict that Ms Deveraux's husband would file for divorce - down to the hour that he would do so. Dubious: The clairvoyant told Ms Deveraux that her $1million 'deposit' for psychic work would be kept for safety at St Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan Bestsellers: Deveraux has sold more than 60 million copies of her romance novels to amass a multimillion-dollar fortune The clairvoyant also told the author to leave her apartment for a few days and change her locks because her estranged husband would show up. Ms Deveraux told the Florida court today that this turned out to be the case and 'staff at her apartment building told her that her husband unexpectedly showed up and was angrier than anyone they'd ever seen', according to the Sun-Sentinel. Marks later asked the author to hand over $1million which she would need to carry out her meditations - but that it would be returned to her. The psychic told Ms Deveraux that the money would be kept in drawers in the cathedral room of St Patrick's. The author was told that 'money was evil' by the psychic and would attract evil if kept in her bank account. Marks, 62, along with other family members has been charged with defrauding $25million from clients through a network of psychic stores in Fort Lauderdale and Manhattan. Swindle: One of the Florida storefronts allegedly used by the psychic fraudsters - they also had locations in Manhattan Most of that money - $17million  - is believed to have come from Ms Deveraux who amassed the vast fortune by selling 60 millions copies of her romance tales, which have titles such as Moonlight In The Morning, The Scent Of Jasmine and Scarlet Nights. She is expected to be on the stand for several days. At the time of Marks' arrest in 2011, prosecutors said ten 'psychic readers' from Fort Lauderdale allegedly conned customers out of a total of $40million, telling them that unless they handed over cash and valuables, they would be haunted. At the time, prosecutors refused to identify the author who they said lost her eight-year-old son in a motorcycle accident, but several sources with knowledge of the case has named Ms Deveraux. The author, whose real name is Jude Gilliam Montassir, wrote on her MySpace page that she 'adopted a son, Sam Alexander Montassir… My son died at age 8 in a motorcycle accident.' Police swooped on the soothsayers, who are all related by blood or marriage in August 2011 after a huge cross-state investigation dubbed 'Operation Crystal Ball'. More than 400 rings, 100 watches and 200 necklaces – many of them from Cartier, Tiffany & Co and Gucci – were seized. They all billed themselves as fortune tellers, clairvoyants and spiritual advisers and operated from shops in Fort Lauderdale. The authorities said that many customers came to them as a desperate last resort, for instance hoping that they could be cured of a disease or put in touch with a deceased loved one. It's alleged, however, that they were then warned that only by parting with money and possessions could they avoid being haunted or befalling terrible bad luck. Customers were promised that their money would be returned once it was cleansed of evil spirits, but according to the indictment it was kept for personal used by the fortune tellers. Victims included a woman with a brain tumour who was told she would receive 'positive energy'. She was reportedly left  unemployed and in danger of losing her apartment. A person in Japan handed over $496,000 to the psychic readers and a man from Denmark sent about $186,000. Mr Bardfield told the court that many of the victims were vulnerable. 'If you understood the severity of what these victims were going through, it makes more sense,' he said. The defendants are facing 47 counts of wire fraud and face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty."

Nepal, Rwanda and Bangladesh were the 'star performers' of the 22-country study carried out by the  Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), followed by Ghana, Tanzania, Cambodia and Bolivia. The report predicts that some of the poorest countries in the world could see acute poverty eradicated within 20 years. The department measured poverty by using a new term called the Multidimensional Poverty Index, or MPI. It measures the intensity of different deprivations that poor people face including nutrition, education and sanitation and not just income. Researchers have devised a new term for measuring poverty called the Multidimensional Poverty Index which is shown along the bottom of the graph. The lighter bar shows the original MPI and the darker bar shows the current MPI If people are deprived in a third or more of ten indicators, the global index identifies them as 'MPI poor'. The study was carried out by Dr Sabina Alkire and Dr Jose Manuel Roche. Dr Alkire said: 'Using this measure, we found that reductions in intensity – the percentage of deprivations people experience at the same time – were strongest in relatively poorer countries, such as Ethiopia, Malawi and Senegal.' In some countries, if progress continues at the same rate, current generations may see the end of acute multidimensional poverty. If people are deprived in a third or more of ten indicators, the global index identifies them as 'MPI poor' For example, if the study’s 'star' countries, Nepal, Rwanda, and Bangladesh, continue to reduce poverty at the current rate, they will halve MPI in less than 10 years and eradicate it in 20. However, the future for other countries does not look as positive. ‘At the current rate of reduction, it will take Ethiopia 45 years to halve multidimensional poverty; in other words, to achieve poverty levels equivalent to those Nigeria has now,’ said OPHI’s Dr José Manuel Roche, who calculated the predictions. ‘Based on the same assumptions, it will take India 41 years and Malawi 74 years to eradicate acute poverty as measured by the MPI. 'But we hope that by providing a more complete and balanced picture, these measures will help spur the eradication of multidimensional poverty.’ Improvements: Nepal did the best in areas like nutrition and child mortality Nepal did the best in areas like nutrition, child mortality, electricity, improved flooring and assets. Rwanda showed the biggest improvement in sanitation and water, and Bangladesh did best in improving sanitation and school attendance. The MPI can also be broken down to reveal the varying rates of progress in different regions of a country or among different social groups. For example, in Nepal, although it had an outstanding overall performance, three of the 13 regions lagged behind the rest of the country, with no statistically significant reduction in MPI poverty. By contrast, Rwanda and Bangladesh achieved significant reductions in both the scale and intensity of multidimensional poverty in every one of their regions. ‘This ability of the MPI to reveal inequalities at a regional level, as well as between social groups, makes it a vital tool for policymakers,’ said Dr Suman Seth, one of OPHI’s research team. ‘The global MPI allows us to compare people’s poverty and see in what ways they are deprived, in order to address these interconnected deprivations and target interventions more accurately.’ The release of the report on changes in poverty over time follows the publication of the MPI in the UN Development Programme's Human Development Report 2013. In 2013, OPHI found that a total of 1.6billion people are living in multidimensional poverty - more than 30 per cent of the combined populations of the 104 countries analysed. It is the first time research has tracked overlapping deprivations in health, education and living standards."

The abuse came to light after five residents aged between 83 and 100 died in just two weeks at the scandal-hit Parkside House Nursing Home in Northampton. Home manager Phyllis Johnson and nurses Anastacia Madulu, Girlie Franklin, Maria McKenzie, and Mary Ombui, were all found guilty of failing to provide basic care to ten residents between them. Nurses: Anastacia Madulu (left) and Girlie Franklin (right) were found guilty of failing to provide basic care Johnson was also found guilty of not reporting the deaths of three residents to the Care and Quality Commission, and failing to provide them nutritious meals and ensure staff were adequately trained. The residents died at the site between July 22 and August 6, 2009, after being left malnourished, immobile in bed, and with putrid pressure sores, a hearing was told. Concerns were first raised when an elderly woman was admitted to Northampton General Hospital on July 21, 2009 with severe pressure sores on her heels exposing her bones and tendons. She was unresponsive and died the next day, exhibiting signs of dehydration and malnourishment. Another resident with severe pressure sores died on the same day at the home, while three people were shipped out of the home over fears for their health. The third vulnerable pensioner died in a community hospital on July 28 while two died in separate care homes on August 4 and 6. Alzheimer’s sufferer Doreen Sheridan, 83, died on August 4 after contracting bronchopneumonia which doctors said was caused by a lack of movement. Neglectful: Mary Ombui (right) admitted all allegations against her on the basis that Maria McKenzie (left) prevented her from providing basic treatment to patients at the care home Healthcare manager Karen Stagg undertook an assessment of some of the residents on July 24 following ‘serious concerns’ about the care provided. Mrs Stagg reported a series of fundamental failings, including staff who could not use basic equipment, residents fed ‘mainly porridge’ and meaningless care plans that were out of date. One female pensioner who suffered from physical and mental disabilities had skin which ‘appeared to be paper thin and dry’. Mrs Stagg had told the panel that an elderly woman at the home had a sore that was ‘necrotic and yellow, slow to heal and granulating’. One pressure sore she inspected was 2.8in across and 2.4in deep - deep enough to ‘feel the bone’, the panel heard. Parkside House’s remaining residents were moved elsewhere and its registration was later cancelled. A serious case review into the deaths found the ‘causes considered to be consistent with the effects of severe neglect’. Madulu, who represented herself at the hearing, and Ombui, who was with her representative, admitted all allegations against them on the basis that McKenzie prevented them from providing basic treatment to patients. Accusations: The abuse came to light after five residents aged between 83 and 100 died in just two weeks at the scandal-hit Parkside House Nursing Home (pictured) in Northampton McKenzie and Franklin were found guilty of the bulk of the charges relating to the residents - referred to as A, B, C, D, E, F, G H, I and J - including failing to provide adequate care. But the pair were cleared of charges including not completing nutrition risk assessments for certain residents, failing to monitor the weight of some residents and not using documentation to help monitor care. Johnson, who denied all the charges, did not attend the Central London hearing and has now retired to Trinidad and Tobago. She was found guilty of the majority of the charges against her and cleared of failing to review procedures and policies at the home and failing to notify the CQC when Residents A, B and C were admitted to hospital. If the nurses are found guilty of misconduct, they could face being barred from the profession. Two other Parkside House nurses, Alice Nojozi and Nobuhle Moyo, were let off with cautions following earlier Nursing and Midwifery Council hearings. The hearing continues with the panel set to decide on whether the charges amount to misconduct tomorrow, before moving on to sanction."

I have raised my sons in South L.A., and it is heartbreaking to see so many young kids on a trajectory to nowhere, potential high school dropouts prey to gangs, drugs, violence and incarceration. So where do we start to create positive change? I believe that change starts from within, and unless you want to take the first step, change will never happen. We need to take the responsibility to be the creative force in our society. We need to be the gardeners of our society. TED.com: Ron Finley's talk on gardening in South Central So instead of waiting for others (the city or other units of government), I decided to take my shovel, my weapon of change, and start gardening. Change begins with youth and healthy role models. Gardening takes care of both. It builds community. Children learn what they live. If children live with hostility, they learn to fight. If they live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive. If they live with criticism, they learn to condemn. If they live around alcohol, drugs, unhealthy food and violence, this is what they will reproduce in their lives and in society in general. This is a vicious circle that needs to end. My vision is that gardening can do that -- and my organization has been planting gardens in South Central, including ones on city-owned land. If kids grow kale, kids eat kale. If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. But when none of this is presented to them, if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body, they blindly eat whatever you put in front of them. When kids learn to grow vegetables, they learn not only how to eat in a healthy way but how to be productive and are armed with a value system that will help them to navigate in their lives -- values such as patience, appreciation, sharing, honesty and respect. You will be surprised how kids are affected by this. One day, I was out in my garden attending to my sunflowers when a teenager passed by with his earphones hooked up, listening to his music. When he saw the huge sunflowers in my garden, he was taken aback: ""Yo! Is dat real?"" He was screaming. A few days later, he joined us in the garden. TED Blog: A visit to Ron Finley's garden But gardening's therapeutic effect is not only for kids. I have been to homeless shelters to install gardens. People will come around and will start telling stories of gardening with their mothers and grandmothers. I see hopeless faces light up; I see the seed of hope where none existed before, and this is for me a great reward. Our society -- not just South Central -- suffers from social corrosion. Due to the economic crisis, parents have to work long hours (if they are lucky enough to have a job), and often, kids are neglected. In many cases, kids grow up with their TV set as parent. Technology offers more ways of nominal communication, but our society tends to promote actual isolation. It is crucially important to cultivate nourishing relationships and human connections, and gardening can definitely do that. So who do you want to be: a bystander or a force of positive change? Pick up your shovel, bring some compost and come meet me in the garden. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ron Finley."

Debbie Foster has already been forced to watch one son die in agony from Leigh's Syndrome - helpless to relieve his pain. So after hearing a second son had the same rare and terminal condition, she found some solace when doctors said a new operation could relieve his agony. Jake, 13, has lost most of the movement in his muscles, meaning he is in constant pain and confined to a wheelchair. Terminally ill teenager Jake Foster was denied NHS funding for an operation to reduce his pain. But thanks to hundreds of MailOnline readers donating money to his fund, the youngster will be able to have the procedure privately In the four days since Jake's story appeared on the MailOnline readers helped raise more than £6,000 to take his fund past the Foster's target of £10,000 Jake (pictured with his parents, Debbie and Robert) has a very rare genetic condition called Leigh's Syndrome, which has already killed one of his brothers But just weeks before he was due to have the operation, NHS bosses refused to pay due to funding cuts. The denial inspired Mrs Foster to take matters into her own hands, setting up an appeal to gather the money together. With £3,000 already in Jake's fund, his story appeared on MailOnline last week, sparking a flood of donations. In just four days readers touched by Jake's plight raised more than £6,000 to take his fund past the £10,000 his family need to pay for the operation. Mrs Foster said she has been humbled by the kindness shown by people from across the country. She told MailOnline: 'It very humbling, truly amazing. It restores your faith in people. 'It was so nice to see Jake's story touching so many people. It just shows there are so many good, caring people in this world. 'I want to thank everyone who has donated, it means the world to us.' 'My husband is not an emotional man, but even he had tears in his eyes reading all the messages left and seeing all the donations. 'It was MailOnline that gave Jake's fund the big push it needed. It is amazing the reaction we have had.' She said raising the money so quickly means Jake will be able to have his life-changing operation this summer. 'I want to thank everyone who has donated, it means the world to us' - Debbie Foster While the procedure won’t save his life, it could prolong it significantly and at the very least make it a lot more comfortable. Mrs Foster, 45, said: ‘All we want to do is make Jake as happy and pain-free as possible and they’ve (NHS) taken that from us. ‘It breaks my heart to hear him cry out in pain at night and not be able to do anything about it. There is nothing worse for a mother.’ It is not known how many weeks, months, or years Jake has left to live, but a child with the genetic disorder is only expected to live to the age of around six or seven. The mother-of-two, who lost her son Robert to the disease at the age of just four on Christmas Eve in 2000, said: ‘It makes me angry that a topless model is allowed to have a boob job on the NHS for cosmetic reasons or someone can have a tummy tuck, but a poorly child has to suffer.’ Jake (pictured as a child with his older brother, James, who has Asperger syndrome) has lost most of his movement as a result of his illness and it causes him extreme pain ‘If a child is in pain and something can be done about it, how they can be denied treatment?’ Jake’s GP first recommended the procedure, called selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR), which is often also used to treat children with cerebral palsy. In October last year he was put on a waiting list for the operation at the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham. But they received a letter in the post in February, weeks before he was due to have the operation, saying due to NHS funding cuts they could no longer fund it. Aspring glamour model Josie Cunningham sparked outrage after her NHS-funded boob job - which has since been reversed - on the NHS As the Mail reported earlier this year, while children such as Jake - and many suffering with cerebral palsy - are being refused funding for life-changing surgery such as a selective dorsal rhizotomy, there is plenty of cash to pay for cosmetic procedures. The case of Josie Cunningham sparked outrage when it emerged she had received breast enlargement on the NHS - and, after tiring of her new assets, a tax-payer funded reduction, too. Ms Cunningham had her 32A breasts enlarged to a 36DD with taxpayers’ money, after saying her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’. Her operation came after she was recommended for funding by her local GP. Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances when it is needed ‘to protect a person’s health’. Then there was the case of morbidly obese Diane Wiggett, who cost the NHS £15,000 by having a gastric band fitted - then having it removed when she decided she preferred being fat. 'We were all excited about it and getting ready for it,’ she said. ‘We have tried to fight it, tried to re-appeal saying Jake is a special case but they just said a blanket “no” response. It’s like talking to robots. ‘The people making these decisions aren’t from a medical background, so there’s no talking to them.’ Mrs Foster and her husband, Robert, 52, who live with Jake and his brother, James, 20, who has Asperger’s Syndrome, were forced to try and raise the money themselves and set up Jake's fundraising page online. Mrs Foster added: 'The initial joy does give way to sheer panic, as well. 'Being a mother, now I am worrying about Jake going into hospital and having the operation, it is only natural I suppose. Jake, a ‘happy child’ given his circumstances and a Birmingham City Football Club fan, spends his life in a wheelchair and is unable to sit up by himself. The teenager, who is much smaller than most boys his age, has very stiff limbs and one leg is stuck in one position, causing him extreme pain. Jake (pictured with his parents) was offered surgery to reduce his pain by cutting some of the nerves in his back. However, the offer of NHS funding was then withdrawn due to funding cuts Jake's parents, Debbie and Robert (pictured with their other son, James), are now trying to raise £10,000 to pay for him to have the operation Very little is known about the inherited disorder that affects the central nervous system and there is little by way of treatment. The SDR operation is the only way Jake’s pain can be relieved without the risk of serious side-effects. It works by cutting the nerves in his back, enabling his limbs to move more freely and therefore making him a lot more comfortable. Mrs Foster, who with her husband is a full time carer for her two boys, but also volunteers to help other parents with disabled children, said: ‘Because he is in so much pain, he is not sleeping. ‘It’s all about energy and when they get tired, they’re more prone to getting infections and then their health goes downhill. ‘At the moment he has fits most evenings which is very frightening which keeps him awake.’ Mrs Foster (pictured with her husband and sons, Jake and James) says it is unacceptable the NHS will pay for weight loss surgery and for boob jobs but it will not pay for surgery to relieve the suffering of a dying teenager Mrs Foster (pictured with her husband, Robert) said: 'All we want to do is make Jake as happy and pain-free as possible and they've taken that from us' Leigh's Syndrome is a severe neurological disorder which usually starts to show symptoms during the first year of life. It causes the progressive loss of mental abilities and of movement. It is usually fatal within a couple of years as it causes respiratory failure. Severe muscle and movement problems then develop and these cause loss of feeling in the limbs, weakness and balance problems. Eye, heart and breathing problems are also common in people with Leigh's Syndrome. The symptoms are caused by patches of damaged tissue that develop in the brains of patients and these lesions are often accompanied by the loss of the nerve coatings. This reduces the ability of the nerves to activate the muscles used for movement and to relay sensory information to the brain. The condition occurs in about one in 40,000 babies. The condition is caused by mutations in one of more than 30 different genes. Source: Genetics Home Reference Jake can only say a few words as the condition also affects the respiratory system. But Mrs Foster said if it wasn’t for his condition, Jake would be ‘a typical 13-year-old’. ‘He’s such a character and very mischievous,’ she said. ‘He likes the baddies in films. Most kids are frightened of Captain Hook and Cruella Deville but from a young age he just thought they were funny.’ There have been several cases this year where poorly children have been refused funding due to cuts. In March two-year-old Sophie Thomlinson who suffers with cerebral palsy was told she couldn’t have an operation that would help her walk. A Daily Mail campaign helped raise the money so she could have the operation. Meanwhile, Around 5,400 gastric bypasses and 1,300 gastric band procedures are performed by the NHS each year and in 2012 it spent £3.5million on 790 breast implant operations. It is estimated Leigh’s Syndrome occurs in one in every 40,000 live births, though certain populations have considerably higher rates. James Hunter, Clinical Director for Musculoskeletal and Neurosciences, for Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said:  ‘Our exceptional funding request to NHS England for Jake’s surgery was unsuccessful. We continue to meet with the family as they explore self-funding Jake’s surgery.’ Visit www.gofundme.com/8i3518 contribute to Jake’s SDR fund."

The offensive linesman had been in a bar prior to the crash, watching the Croatian soccer team beat the Republic of Ireland 3-1 in the European Championship. The 6'5, 304lb player used his Twitter account to apologize for crashing into three parked cars in Queens, New York after he was found to have a blood alcohol level of .182 percent - more than twice the legal limit. Clash: David Diehl (centre) poses with fans as he celebrates Croatia's victory over the Republic of Ireland in this picture posted on Twitter before the crash One bystander, Al, 48, told the New York Daily News: 'He was totally obliterated. He couldn’t even function.' Diehl entered no plea at court today after spending the night in a cell wearing his Croatian soccer top. His case was adjourned until July 26. The judge also barred the player from driving until his next court date. He could spend up to a year in jail over the charge. Diehl wrote on Twitter: 'I’ve worked hard during my career to set a positive example, and yesterday I fell far short of this standard. I apologize to my family, my fans, my teammates, the New York Giants, and the NFL. 'I made a poor decision that I sincerely regret, and, as always, take full responsibility for my actions.' Jubilant: Diehl, whose relatives hail from Croatia, tweeted 'Gooooooaaaaalllll!!!!!' twice as the team scored and later wrote '3-1' when the win was confirmed Giant: 6ft 5in NFL star David Diehl was charged with drink-driving after his luxury car smashed into parked vehicles Diehl, 31, whose relatives hail from Croatia, twice tweeted 'Gooooooaaaaalllll!!!!!' in celebration as the team scored. A photograph of him wearing a red and white chequered Croatia replica shirt was also posted on Twitter, but it was removed following his arrest. Diehl, who has twice won the Super Bowl with the Giants, wrecked his black BMW at about 8.20pm on Sunday night in the Astoria area of the city. No one was injured. He had been driving alone and was arrested at the scene. Diehl was taken to a police station and he failed a breath test. The Twitter user who posted the picture of Diehl said the star was celebrating at Scorpio Cafe & Bar in Astoria, which is five blocks from the crash site at Broadway and 31st Street. Police confirmed the player had been to a local bar. Diehl had been watching the Croatia team move to the top of Group C at the Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. He tweeted 'Gooooooaaaaalllll!!!!!' twice and later wrote '3-1' when the team's win was confirmed. The final tweet carried the hashtag '#hrvatska', which means Croatia in its native language. The Giants, who are the reigning Super Bowl champions, made no immediate comment. The player’s agent, Peter Schaffer, declined to comment, but called Diehl 'one of, if not the classiest, most humble ... New York Giants ever'.

Tanya Monique Peel, from Raleigh, North Carolina, allegedly set up a business account at a JP Morgan Chase Bank in Atlanta last December before transferring $123,000 from a stranger's Charles Schwab account. Peel, 26, used her real name on the account and when police found the name on Facebook, her selfies matched the woman recorded by bank surveillance cameras, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Wanted: This photo of Tanya Monique Peel on her Facebook page matched a woman seen withdrawing stolen funds from a bank on surveillance footage. A warrant is out for her arrest Authorities are still looking for the woman and secured a warrant for her arrest last week. 'I think she is with a group of professionals,' Atlanta Police Detective Ken Stapler told the AJC. 'There is no way she did this by herself.' The transfer was carried out after Peel and fellow suspects stole the identity of the Charles Schwab client, 45-year-old Atlanta resident Terance Fowler. The investigation began when Fowler reported the theft to police. His bank refunded the stolen sum. He lost his money when the group got hold of his identifying information and his cellphone number, knowing that Charles Schwab called account holders after transfers were made from their accounts. Scam: She allegedly transferred $123,000 from one victim's account and her co-conspirators pretended to be the victim when authorities called them to verify the transfer. In total, they stole $175,000 from accounts The team then forwarded all of the victim's calls to an untraceable cellphone so that when they transferred the cash, Charles Schwab representatives called his cell but ended up speaking to one of the fraudsters. They pretended to be him and gave authorization for the transfers. In total, they transferred $123,000 from his account to Peel's phony business account and another $52,000 to a Walls Fargo branch in California. Investigators say that Peel then immediately withdrew all the money from the account. Crimestoppers of Atlanta is now offering a $2,000 reward for information that leads to arrest and indictment of Peel. Callers can leave confidential tips at 404-577-TIPS (8477)."

Out of the corner of my eye I saw cast member Mark Carroll suddenly loom over them with a club, and proceed to pretend to beat them. It’s a moment of racial ugliness in Memphis, which won a Tony for best musical on Broadway four years ago, that shocks to the core. ‘The first time I did that scene, I must say I felt pretty sick inside,’ said Knight, who plays would-be singer Felicia Farr, ‘that people did that to each other, with no sense of guilt or shame.’ Beverley Knight stars as  aspiring singer Felicia Farr in new musical Memphis, set in segregated Tennessee The show is set in segregated Tennessee and focuses on Huey Calhoun, a white DJ, played by Donnelly, who introduces the ‘devil’s music’ (rhythm and blues — or any music with a pulse) to the ‘white folks’ in the Fifties and early Sixties. Calhoun is loosely based on the late DJ Dewey Phillips, who launched R&B on his audience with a delivery like an express train. The reason for the beating in the show is that Huey and Felicia are dating. ‘Black and white romance was illegal then,’ Donnelly said. Knight said she had visited Memphis. ‘Segregation is over, but they still preserve the whites-only water fountain — and the blacks-only one.’ The singer was a sensation in the musical The Bodyguard before taking on Memphis, created by David Bryan, Joe DiPietro and director Christopher Ashley. The show is set in segregated Tennessee and focuses on Huey Calhoun, a white DJ, played by Killian Donnelly (left), who introduces the ‘devil’s music' The original songs and energy of the cast are exciting. I had some misgivings when I saw the show in New York, but it has been worked on since then. Donnelly and Knight make an electrifying duo. He has a special routine to protect his voice, and has been contracted to do seven out of eight performances each week. She will do six and drinks lashings of Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa, a black sweet Chinese tea, to keep her voice in tip-top condition for when previews start at the Shaftesbury Theatre on October 9. Katie can't wait to be the Carole singer Oh! Carole! Actress Katie Brayben has been chosen to give voice to Carole King in the West End. The team behind the Broadway hit Beautiful have selected Ms Brayben, currently portraying Diana, Princess of Wales in the satirical play King Charles III, to play the singer/songwriter in a musical that charts her journey from Brooklyn schoolgirl to artist behind some of some of the world’s most beloved tunes — Will You Love Me Tomorrow, for starters. She wrote that one with first husband Gerry Goffin, along with Take Good Care Of My Baby, and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. In between writing many of those heartfelt numbers, though, Goffin cheated on her and took large amounts of drugs. Katie Brayben has been chosen to give voice to American singer Carole King in the West End Songs written by King, Goffin, Cynthia Weil, Barry Mann and Neil Sedaka are woven around a story that eventually makes King the heroine of an edgy drama. And there’s not a number in Beautiful that you won’t know. Brayben has appeared in straight plays and musicals before and is a casting coup for the part. She plays the piano and cello, and writes and performs her own compositions. Her parents are folk and blues singers Fran McGillivray and Mike Burke, so there was always music in the family, what with her sister Jo Burke being a folk singer, too. ‘I’ve never known a project where I say: “I love that song! I love that song . . . and that one!” Brayben said, as we went through the King catalogue, which encompasses hits such as You’ve Got A Friend. ‘She’s such a wonderful songwriter, and the numbers have these beautiful melodies. They speak to people,’ Brayben said. One of Brayben’s friends told her she was a ‘natural’ for the show, and urged her to audition. At that time, the producers hadn’t decided whether to bring over Jessie Mueller, who created the role on Broadway. But Paul Blake and Mike Bosner, two of the main producers, told me that finally, they and director Marc Bruni decided to find an actress here. ‘It’s a star-making role,’ Blake explained — a view I share. Brayben is being allowed to leave King Charles III early to prepare for rehearsals that start in late December. Her spare time has been spent studying King’s concerts on YouTube, listening to her recordings and reading her autobiography. King studied Brayben, too; watching videos of the actress’s auditions and giving her blessing to the casting. Previews for Beautiful begin at the Aldwych Theatre on February 10, with an official first night on February 24. Alan Morrissey has been cast as Goffin, and Glynis Barber will play King’s mother. Lorna Want and Gary Trainor also co-star. The cast of the latest movie based on Jane Austen’s Pride And Prejudice spent little time researching etiquette and manners of the period. Instead, their focus was on martial arts and fight training. In Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, the latest iteration of Austen’s classic, the Bennet sisters are under attack from the flesh-eating un-dead, who pop up at the most inconvenient times. Actress-model Suki Waterhouse told me the cast, including Lily James as Elizabeth Bennet and Sam Riley as Mr Darcy, spent several days learning how to use a sword. ‘We have to know how to kill the zombies,’ she said. ‘You can’t just give them a little shove.’ The cast will wear period dress in the film, and much of Austen’s prose will be kept intact. ‘The zombie stuff is woven through the original text,’ Waterhouse explained. She joins the cast on set today, with director Burr Steers overseeing the mayhem. Waterhouse, 22, already knows how to box, and her father, a black belt, let her attend the karate classes he gave at a leisure centre when she was younger. The model has made a good fist of her fledgling thespian career. She fights on the side of the good guys in the film Insurgent, follow-up to Divergent. She also appears in Love, Rosie, which goes on release here on October 22. ‘That film gave me the proper itch to pursue acting as a career,’ she told me, noting that although she takes acting classes, ‘the best thing for me is to watch and observe’ other actors. Suki has been stepping out with Bradley Cooper, but when I asked her if rumours the pair were engaged were true, she replied, simply: ‘No, we’re not.’"
520737,cnn-train-91af15a6dcc7240edbaa69820972e5ab7b69bfab,Read more: Why China needs to learn three letters.,SUPPORTS,"[169, 181]",1.0,,,,cnndm/cnn/stories/91af15a6dcc7240edbaa69820972e5ab7b69bfab.story,"(CNN) -- The challenge facing the next generation of the Chinese leadership is steering the nation as it moves from an export and investment driven economy to a more sustainable consumption-driven economy. However, such transformation will not be easy. Over the last two decades, various measures to encourage Chinese consumption had limited success. The expansion of higher education since mid-1990s was one early attempt. While a success in matriculation -- 19% of Chinese under the age of 30 have a college degrees -- the move failed to spur consumption as families instead saved to afford university educations. A similar story can be seen in the commercialization of the housing market. Families have to save increasingly more in order to afford apartments with rising prices. Given the spotty success of Beijing policy to boost consumption, new research suggests the key may lie in tackling China's growing divide between the rich and the poor. Read more: Why China needs to learn the three R's The government has never publicly released household-level data necessary to study this problem. To gauge the scope of the problem, my colleagues and I at China Household Finance Survey conducted a nationwide survey, interviewing a random sample of 8,438 households in China, both rural and urban. We found that the top 10% of Chinese households garnered 57% of total income and 85% of total assets -- a concentration level of income and wealth that surpasses those of developed countries, and can only be found in some of the African countries such as South Africa and Seychelles. Income inequality is the key reason for China's low consumption rate. The rich hold the vast majority of Chinese savings. The top 10% of households have 69% of the total savings, and average saving rate for these households is a staggering 60%. Conversely, about half of the Chinese households surveyed have negligible savings. Therein lies the dilemma for Beijing's new leaders as they try to make Chinese consumers, not exports, the key driver of China's economy. Why? The data suggests China's rich are already spending what they need, and pocketing most of the rest. The low savings rate of most Chinese households surveyed suggest they simply don't have the money to spend. To move toward a consumer-based economy, therefore, raising the income -- and spending -- levels for the poor is key. Read more: Why China won't turn the other cheek over foreign policy Here the next generation of Chinese leadership can and should play a significant role. Typical thinking is to attack the problem from the income side by increasing the tax on the rich and redistribute it to the poor. Chinese policymakers are working in a similar vein. Beijing plans to issue new guidance on income redistribution in December. Although information on this measure is still limited, it is likely to focus on the income side by regulating market wages -- a disappointment if it were true. Additional regulation will not only create market inefficiencies, it simply may not work -- if the past is any example, firms will find ways to circumvent regulation. An effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption, however, is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads, railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment. Studies have shown that spending on social welfare can have a substantial effect on consumption. In the case of health insurance, each one dollar the government spends would increase consumption by $2.36 dollars for rural health insurance or $4.16 for urban employee health insurance, according to a series studies by my colleagues and I did in 2010. Although 90% of Chinese population is currently covered by three basic health insurance systems, benefits differ substantially across the three systems because of different levels of contributions made by the government to the insurance premiums. Government should bring up the benefit level of the rural insurance to that of urban insurance. Another important area that government can do is to establish an effective unemployment insurance system. So far, the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30% of that of health insurance. It also pays too little: unemployment benefit is only 17% of the average salary compared to 47% in the U.S. and 60% in Germany. Given the challenges ahead, China's new leadership should view this with some urgency: When the economy is in transition, unemployment rate will likely rise and more people will need help. Read more: Why China's reforms have hit a brick wall Unfortunately, Chinese government has not given up the idea of spending on massive infrastructure projects to remedy its economic problems. Over the last 10 years, government spending on social welfare programs is only about 3% of the total spending. If the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens, Chinese workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies, unemployment and retirement, and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer-driven economy.

Ringleader Abu Bakr Mansha - who was previously jailed under the Terrorism Act for plotting to kill or harm a decorated soldier - was with a teenage boy when the pair began the unprovoked attack at a busy Tesco store in Bow, east London. He assaulted the two victims before following them home to discover where they lived - then called four other thugs to help. Vicious: Abu Bakr Mansha, 30 (pictured), has been jailed for 10 years for launching a vicious, unprovoked attack on two men which began in a Tesco supermarket because they were black and non-Muslim Armed with baseball bats, they beat the two men in a vicious attack which left both victims needing hospital treatment for serious injuries. One of the victims, who were 40 and 49 at the time, suffered two broken wrists and a fractured skull. The Inner London Crown Court heard there was both a religious element and a racial element to the attack on the two men, who were black and non-Muslim. The vicious assault sparked an investigation by the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command. All six of the attackers, who the Met Police confirmed were Muslim, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent. Judge Ian Darling said: 'Not only was there a religious aspect to this offence, but there was an undoubted racial element. Salim Jada, 32 (left) and Javed Patel, 29 (right) both of Newham, north London, were jailed for eight years each 'Both prior to and after the attack, Mr Mansha is heard to use language that is foul, unacceptable and which reveals a degree of racial intolerance that is worrying.' Ringleader Mansha, of Newham, north London, was jailed for 10 years. He had already been jailed under the Terrorism Act in 2005 for plotting to kill or harm a decorated British soldier who had served in Iraq. A court heard he had collected newspaper cuttings about the exploits of Corporal Mark Byles, who had been awarded the Military Cross after leading an attack in which five insurgents died. A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed the Abu Bakr Mansha jailed this week was the same Abu Bakr Mansha jailed over the plot in 2005. Of the others involved in the 2012 attack, the teenage boy - who cannot be named because he is currently 17 years old - was sentenced to an 18-month detention and training order. Salim Jada, 32, and Javed Patel, 29, both also of Newham, were jailed for eight years each. Thugs: Zuber Kara (left), of Bow, east London, was jailed for two years, while Ibrahim Mohammed (right), 32, from Newham, was sentenced to six-and-a-half years' jail. A sixth attacker is 17 and cannot be named Ibrahim Mohammed, 32, from Newham, was sentenced to six-and-a-half years' jail, while 30-year-old Zuber Kara, of Bow, east London, received a two-year jail sentence. Acting Commander Duncan Ball, the head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command, said: 'This was a vicious, cowardly, racist and religiously-motivated attack during which the victims received serious injuries. 'The support and assistance of the local community was vital and illustrates the refusal of the public to feel intimidated by such violent criminal behaviour. 'The fitting sentences provide strong reassurance that we remain resolute in pursuing those who carry out acts of violence.' A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain said: ‘This was a criminal act and we condemn it unreservedly. Our thoughts and sympathy are with both victims and their families. 'Criminals are not motivated by anything other than their own base desires. If they claim they were motivated by faith, as some have reported, then they are surely misguided.'"

To make white cells behave like brown ones, researchers found a new signalling pathway called adenosine Sit ups help tone your stomach, while squats strengthen your legs and bottom - but love handles are particularly difficult to shift. Now scientists believe they have discovered a way to ‘melt’ the excess white fat in muffin tops by turning it ‘brown’. While white cells are responsible for muffin tops and flab in general, brown fat cells convert excess energy in food into heat. To make white cells behave like brown ones, researchers at the University of Bonn discovered a new signalling pathway. ‘Not all fat is equal,’ said Professor Alexander Pfeifer from the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology of the University Hospital Bonn. ‘If we are able to activate brown fat cells or to convert white fat cells into brown ones, it might be possible to simply melt excess fat away.’ By experimenting on mice, Professor Pfeifer discovered a new signalling pathway for a molecule called adenosine. Adenosine is known to activate brown fat cells, and is typically released during stress. The adenosine signal is transmitted  adenosine receptor A2A. ‘If adenosine binds to this receptor in brown fat cells, fat burning is significantly stimulated,’ claimed Dr. Thorsten Gnad from Professor Pfeifer's team. ‘The brown fat in mice behaves just as in humans,’ added Professor Pfeifer. In addition, the research team investigated the possibility that adenosine transforms white fat cells into brown fat cells - a process termed ‘browning’. White fat cells normally cannot be induced to burn excess fat by adenosine, because they lack the A2A receptor. Adenosine (molecule illustrated) is capable of activating brown fat cells and is typically released during stress. The adenosine signal is transmitted by the adenosine receptor A2A. By transferring the A2A receptor gene in white fat cells in mice, they began 'browning' and burning energy For this reason, the team of scientists transferred the A2A receptor gene from brown fat cells to white fat cells in mice. Consequently, the white fat cells with A2A receptors started 'browning' and burning energy. ‘Through the administration of adenosine-like substances, the mice actually lost weight,’ continued Professor Pfeifer. 'Our results demonstrate that adenosine-A2A signalling plays an unexpected physiological role in [brown fat] activation and protects mice from diet-induced obesity. Those findings reveal new possibilities for developing novel obesity therapies.' However, many questions still need to be investigated, continued the researchers, and clinical application is 'still far off'. The results are published in the journal Nature."

""There is reason to believe that a crime has been committed,"" read a statement from Marianne Ny, Sweden's director of public prosecutions. ""Considering information available at present, my judgment is that the classification of the crime is rape."" She said more investigation is necessary before she can make a final decision. An ongoing investigation about a separate charge of molestation will be extended, she added, but the charge will also be escalated to include a sexual component. The molestation charge was previously equivalent to a non-sexual charge of harassment, but it will now come under the heading of sexual coercion and sexual molestation, which are both crimes, she said. Assange's lawyer, Leif Silbersky, said he and his client were ""very surprised"" at the decisions. ""It's unbelievable,"" he told CNN. ""We thought that this circus had ended. Now it's happening all over again."" Prosecutors questioned Assange for about an hour on Monday, though only about the complaint of molestation, Silbersky told CNN. He said police never mentioned the rape allegation during that questioning. ""He maintains that he is completely innocent,"" Silbersky said. Silbersky said he has not been shown anything about the rape allegation and is not sure what the next step is. Swedish authorities arrested Assange ""in absentia"" last month on charges of rape and molestation. The chief prosecutor later revoked the arrest warrant and dropped the rape charge. The charges came from two separate women. The lawyer for both women appealed, asking for the rape charge to be reinstated and the molestation charge to be upgraded to include a sexual component. Before he was questioned, Assange told CNN he had no idea what the case was about. Assange told the Arabic-language television network Al-Jazeera August 22 the accusations are ""clearly a smear campaign."" The only question, he said, is who is behind it. The allegations follow WikiLeaks' release last month of 76,000 pages of U.S. documents related to the war in Afghanistan. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has criticized the leak, saying it would have a significant negative impact on troops and allies, revealing techniques and procedures. Assange has defended the leak, saying it can help shape the public's understanding of the war. He said the material was of no operational significance and that WikiLeaks tried to ensure the material did not put innocent people at risk. The attorney for the alleged victims has told CNN that rumors of possible Pentagon or CIA involvement in the sex crime accusations against Assange are ""complete nonsense.""

Jim Karr was a popular coffee guru who had been director of brewing technology of the city's Intelligenstia for years. The 48-year-old had been trying to dismantle a commercial-grade coffee maker after an outside event at the city when he was crushed. Loss: Jim Karr died from serious injuries on Saturday after a coffee machine fell on top of him Mr Karr, who had left Intelligenstia to set up his own coffee company - SteamVolt - died from serious head and chest injuries. An autopsy showed that he died from multiple injuries caused by being crushed. The death, which happened at a charity Bike the Drive event, has been ruled an accident, the Chicago Tribune reported. Friends and former colleagues quickly paid tribute to Mr Karr, who they described as a 'legend and mentor to the entire specialty coffee community'. Jesse, of coffee company Dark Matter, described Mr Karr in a Facebook post as 'an inspiration' and added that he 'constantly ideated with me new ways for us to do both better'. 'Jim will be missed dearly, but his work will forever be lived out by the people he has touched in life,' the post added. It is believed some staff members of Dark Matter had been with Mr Karr at the time of the accident. Tragic: Jim, the founder of an innovative coffee company, was crushed as he packed up a machine at a Bike the Drive event in Chicago Mr Karr was a well-known and popular figure in the coffee industry, with contacts as far afield as San Francisco paying tribute to him. Nicholas Cho, of Wrecking Ball Coffee Roaster in San Francisco, told DNAInfo Chicago: 'In terms of the work Jim did, he was one of the very few in the country that was known as being a top expert at what he did.' Trey Elder, who used to work with Mr Karr at Intelligentsia, added that he was known by everyone in the business, from the baristas to the sales teams. 'Most people that are serious about their coffee profession at some point ran into Jim,' Mr Elder said, adding that he had been quick-witted, quiet and kind-hearted. After seven years as Intelligenstia's brewing director, Mr Karr had founded SteamVolt in 2012, which offered technical support to coffee companies, and focused on innovation."

Dale Cregan, 29, was held at Manchester Airport in June after returning on a flight from Thailand. But he was allowed home pending further inquiries. Cregan had been questioned over the murder of Mark Short, who was gunned down in a Manchester pub on May 25. Scroll down for video Hideout: Dale Cregan, who was being sought by police offering a £50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest, may have been hiding out in this outhouse at the rear of the White Hart pub in Hyde, Greater Manchester Going underground: Staff at the pub discovered a pillow, blanket and candle on top of a pile of newspapers in a shed at the back of the White Hart pub Overflowing: The disused outhouse was overflowing with newspapers when staff went to inspect it By the time the police finally had him under lock and key on Tuesday, he was suspected of three more – the two policewomen and Short’s father, David, in a gun and grenade attack in August 10. Greater Manchester's Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy today defended his force's decision to release Cregan, insisting it was 'absolutely normal' for him to have been bailed. Sir Peter said: 'It is absolutely normal in the course of complex crime inquiries that when people are arrested there are occasions where there is insufficient evidence available for them to be charged. 'In those circumstances suspects have to be released on bail as there are strict time limits covering how long suspects can be held in custody without charge. 'That is exactly what happened in this case.' A spokesman for the force said officers could hold a suspect for a total of 96 hours, if magistrates grant permission. The spokesman would not disclose how long Cregan was held for before being bailed. Until recently Cregan, who has worked as a roofer and lived for a time in Tenerife, had few major dealings with police. Born in Tameside to parents Paul and Anita Cregan, and with a younger sister, he was well-known as an intimidating character. His image was enhanced by his facial appearance. He told friends that he lost his eye after being hit in Thailand. Police had offered a £50,000 reward for information about the murders of David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23. The Short family had been at loggerheads with a rival clan for more than ten years but it spilled into bloodshed – reputedly over drug debts – in May when Mark Short was killed. A gunman walked into the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden on May 25 and Mark Short died from a gunshot wound to the neck. Four men have been charged in connection with his murder and are due to enter pleas at Manchester Crown Court in November. Tragic: Police officers Pc Fiona Bone (left), 32, and Pc NIcola Hughes (right), 23, were shot dead on a routine call David Short was killed in a gun and grenade attack at his home in Clayton on August 10 and earlier this month a 33-year-old man appeared at Manchester Crown Court charged with his murder. Suspect: Police released this photo of Dale Cregan who was wanted in connection with the killings of a father and son David Short is understood to have vowed revenge for his son’s death and had threatened to murder relatives of Mark Short’s killer in retaliation. Short senior had apparently been repeatedly warned that his life was in danger and been wearing a bulletproof vest for the past eight years. By 2004, police had issued him with three ‘Osman’ warnings – served when officers receive intelligence that someone is at risk of serious harm or being killed. It is believed he may have been killed in a ‘pre-emptive strike’. Both father and son had served time behind bars. In 2006, David Short was jailed for six years for possessing a firearm with intent, after he and his son drove a gunman away from a street where shots were fired in daylight. Six months after the shooting, Short battered a man during a drunken row at the Garibaldi pub in Gorton, which led to a conviction for wounding. Back in the 1990s he was accused of intimidating a witness after threatening a woman while wearing a balaclava. Mark Short also had a history of violence, admitting firearms offences following the 2006 incident involving his father, but was spared a custodial sentence.

The amateur boxer had been one of a gang of three who carjacked a 60-year-old man in east Manchester before going on to knock a shopkeeper unconscious in an attack three months later. In the aftermath of the father and son killings, a huge manhunt had failed to find the suspect. The operation to track him down was costing police £150,000 a day and almost the entire armed response police units of Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire were involved. Officers drove digital billboards with posters around North Manchester and the Tameside area. Posters were displayed across the city and flashed up on giant screens inside Manchester City’s Etihad stadium during their match against Queens Park Rangers this month. The high-profile publicity campaign went alongside police searches of more than 100 properties and hundreds of officers were assigned to the case.

This year two Merseyside gangsters were jailed for life after planting a grenade in bushes outside former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish’s home. It was apparently intended for a neighbour. They were responsible for a merciless campaign of violence including numerous shootings but their weapon of choice was the grenade.

Some 147 schools are now in special measures, a rise of 62 per cent, while those given top ratings remains the same. Sir Michael Wilshaw will cite the data as evidence that standards have stagnated – and progress could even go into reverse. Despite giving heads more freedom to run their own affairs, he will warn that too many state secondaries still struggle to provide educational 'basics' – with 'indifferent' teaching and poor discipline. Launching his annual report, Sir Michael will reveal how the number of pupils being taught in schools rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted has risen by 70,000 in two years to 170,000. At the same time, the proportion of schools given Ofsted's top ratings – good and outstanding – remains unchanged on last year at about 70 per cent. While primary schools are continuing to 'forge ahead', improvements at secondary level have 'plateaued', he will say. In too many cases, secondaries are allowing bad behaviour to go unchallenged and are led by 'weak' head teachers and governors who lack oversight of standards. Sir Michael – the chief inspector of schools – will add that many secondaries 'lack meaningful support' despite the Government's academies programme which has seen hundreds of schools govern themselves or hand over management to sponsors. In a speech to launch his third annual report, he will call for an end to 'sterile' debates about how schooling should be structured. 'Where schools are failing, it is not because they are local authority schools or academies, or because they are part of a multi-academy trust or because they stand alone,' he will tell an audience. 'They are failing because they haven't got the essentials right: governance and oversight is weak, leadership is poor, misbehaviour goes unchallenged and teaching is indifferent. Launching his annual report, Sir Michael will reveal how the number of pupils being taught in schools rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted has risen by 70,000 in two years to 170,000 'If our education system is to continue to progress we need to concentrate on the basics of why schools and colleges fail and why they succeed.' He will also call for stronger monitoring of struggling schools which had become 'isolated' and lacked support from local authorities or sponsors. 'These schools are deprived of effective support when times are bad,' he will say. 'They are left unchallenged when they flirt with complacency. In many cases they are totally insulated from effective governance. They are bereft of good leadership and teaching practice. They remain apart from schools that could partner them.' In contrast, Sir Michael will highlight the performance of schools rated 'outstanding' which he says are doing a 'superb job' and creating a 'strong learning ethos'. And he will argue that primaries have continued to improve, largely because heads and governors are 'getting the basics right' – such as the effective teaching of the 'phonics' reading method. Alongside a national report, Sir Michael will also publish eight regional reports. It will show that in 13 local authority areas, fewer than half of secondary schools are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted."

Debate could start before the end of the month in the drug-steeped country where marijuana, known popularly as 'ganja,' has long been culturally entrenched but is illegal. Following approval by the country's cabinet, Justice Minister Mark Golding said he expects to introduce the legislation in the Senate by the end of this week. A farmer shows off a marijuana plant during at his plantation in Jamaica's central mountain town of Nine Mile Golding said the bill would establish a 'cannabis licensing authority' to deal with the various regulations needed to cultivate, sell and distribute marijuana for medical, scientific and therapeutic purposes. 'We need to position ourselves to take advantage of the significant economic opportunities offered by this emerging industry,' he said. It would make possession of 2 ounces or less of the drug a ticketable offense that would not result in a criminal record and growing five or fewer plants on any premises would be permitted. Rastafarians would also be able to legally use marijuana for religious purposes for the first time in Jamaica, where the spiritual movement was founded in the 1930s. For decades, debate has raged in Jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting ganja. But now, with a number of countries and U.S. states relaxing their marijuana laws the Jamaican government is advancing reform plans. Golding stressed that the government would not soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking and it intends to use a portion of revenues from its new licensing authority to support a public education campaign to discourage pot smoking by youngsters and mitigate public health consequences. The head of Jamaica's Cannabis Commercial and Medicinal Research Taskforce said he expected the bill to be passed soon in Parliament, where Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller's governing party holds a 2-1 majority. 'The development is long overdue,' task force director Delano Seiveright said."

But for 22-year-old Stephanie Walker it became a horrifying reality of life. Miss Walker used to self-harm in her sleep and woke with injuries ranging from small grazes, to gashes which left pools of blood in her bedding. Stephanie Walker (pictured with her boyfriend Matt Daniels) developed a form of sleepwalking which saw her cut herself in her sleep - it was so bad that she would wake up to find her sheets soaked in blood She struggled with an unusual and terrifying form of sleepwalking but has recently found relief thanks to a combination of medication and therapy. She was given sleeping tablets in an attempt to put her into such a deep sleep that she couldn't get up during the night. When this treatment failed, she was referred for a form of hypnotherapy known as sleep therapy. This treatment has now put an end to her night time injuries. Miss Walker said: 'I had one-on-one sessions with a sleep therapist and a counsellor. The therapist focused on examining my stress levels and revisiting the memories of self-harming while I was awake when I was younger. 'It scared me to think that my body was reacting in the way it did because I had no conscious outlet for the stress I was feeling. 'After the sessions with the therapist and the counsellor, I was much more relaxed. At first, I was still harming myself in my sleep, but the injuries became less bad. 'It stopped completely after me and my current boyfriend, Matt, became close again. We were very close friends when I was 16, but I lost contact with him between the ages of 19 and 21. 'It hurt to be apart from him. But since I've been in my current job, and in a stable relationship, I've never felt better.' Miss Walker (pictured in September 2011 while she was sleepwalking) said she was terrified because she did not know why she kept waking up with cuts on her legs Miss Walker (pictured with her mother, Lynn) feared she would unintentionally hurt her parents or brother during one of her sleepwalking episodes Until she received treatment, Miss Walker would use knives to cut her legs while she was asleep. She said: ‘At first I didn’t know what was going on. I knew no-one could have been coming into my room during the night. ‘The injuries ranged from little spots and cuts to quite severe marks which left a lot of blood on my bed sheets. The only rational explanation was that I was doing it to myself. It was extremely scary.’ The frightening night episodes began when Miss Walker was 19, as she struggled emotionally following the breakdown of a relationship. She was terrified that her inexplicable night time activities would eventually lead her to hurt her mother, Lynn, 52, father, Peter, 54, or brother, Michael, 23. ‘I was able to piece together what was happening - I was getting out of bed and finding sharp objects, like knives, and then hurting myself,’ she said. ‘I must have wandered all around the house looking for cutting tools. But I had no idea I was doing it.’ Miss Walker was eventually referred for a form of hypnotherapy called sleep therapy, which finally put an end to her night time antics She added: ‘I was always worried I was going to hurt my parents. I wouldn’t dream of hurting them, but then I didn’t have any control.’ Serious injuries occurred nearly every week and soon Miss Walker was anxious that nothing could be done to stop her bizarre behaviour. She said: ‘It started happening with no warning at all. I had self-harmed when I was a younger teenager, but I hadn’t done anything like it for years. Miss Walker has now taken the step of covering the scars on her right leg with a colourful tattoo of Jack and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas ‘I sought help from my mum almost straight away. I’d gone to her when I hurt myself when I was younger, so I thought of seeking help from her first. ‘She was so supportive. She came to every single appointment with me, and every therapy session. ‘At first the doctors thought I was doing it to myself while I was awake. They sent me to counselling and analysed me, and put me on strong sleeping tablets which they thought would knock me out to the extent that I wouldn’t be able to move when I was asleep. ‘But they didn’t work. I became more and more stressed. ‘I kept nagging the doctors for help. They sent me for sleep therapy - a form of hypnotism - which began to make a difference. As the injuries became less severe, I breathed a big sigh of relief.’ Miss Walker, from Leeds, has not experienced any such injuries for a year. This week she moved into her own flat, confident her nocturnal self-harming has gone for good. Having completed her therapy treatment, she is being supported through her recovery by her boyfriend Matt Daniels, 23. Miss Walker said: ‘I feel freed from my behaviour, as if I’m able to move on with my life.’ She has even taken the step of covering the scars on her right leg with a colourful tattoo. She said: ‘You can’t see the scars on my legs any more. Most of them have been covered by a tattoo of Jack and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas - it’s one of my favourite films.’"

But a Which? investigation has revealed that the money could be wasted as soon as the manufacturer releases its next range, and ditches support for its older models. It found popular apps and services, such as Netflix and BBC iPlayer, can be removed on models that are only a year or two old - and often without notice. An investigation by Which? magazine discovered customers can lose services when manufacturers release new smart TVs. Manufacturers pay licenses to host apps, and this means they don't always choose to cover app licenses for older products. This graphic reveals which apps are supported on LG and Panasonic sets When a TV manufacturer updates its smart TV range, the whole operating system it runs on can potentially change to incorporate new features. This means the people who make the apps may have to redesign and recode their services to make them compatible. Manufacturers have to pay the developers for licenses to host the apps and show the content and, as a result, may choose to only cover app licenses for their newer products, and not their older ones. Keeping apps such as BBC iPlayer and Netflix available on smart TVs requires agreement between the manufacturers and the third-party app providers. If they can't agree, or either party changes their technology or software, consumers can lose services. The investigation began when Which? was contacted by Samsung and LG smart TV customers who bought their sets in 2010 and 2011 respectively. They were outraged after losing access to LoveFilm, now called Amazon Prime Instant Video.

Keeping apps such as BBC iPlayer and Netflix available on smart TVs requires an agreement between manufacturers and app providers. If they can't agree, or either party changes their technology or software, consumers lose out This also goes the other way - if a TV was sold before an app becomes available, it’s unlikely the developers will ever make it backward compatible, meaning it will never work on models released before the app launched. In some cases, manufacturers refuse to guarantee the availability of apps on their smart TVs, acknowledging they may be removed without notice. It’s not just about time and money, though. Apps have ‘optimum environments’ in which they work. This means that a particular app, such as Netflix, may have been designed to work on a device with a minimum processing power and screen resolution. In some cases, manufacturers refuse to guarantee the availability of apps on their smart TVs. According to the report 'manufacturers blame the app providers, the app providers blame the manufacturers, and the retailers blame everyone but themselves. Yet in the middle of this, consumers can lose out' If an older TV doesn’t meet these requirements, customers will get a poorer experience and Netflix could develop a reputation for providing a sub-standard service. According to the Which? investigation, ‘manufacturers blame the app providers, the app providers blame the manufacturers, and the retailers blame everyone but themselves. ‘Yet in the middle of this, consumers can lose out. Since the product itself hasn’t developed a physical fault, it’s a grey area for consumer rights.' A new consumer rights bill is being debated in parliament that will, for the first time, provide consumers with specific rights about digital content."

Roger Federer hailed his stunning shot against Novak Djokovic as the best of his career. The world number one produced a near-faultless performance to defeat fourth seed Djokovic in straight sets to reach his sixth consecutive U.S. Open Final at Flushing Meadows, but it was an outrageous shot to set up match point that will be most remembered. It came with Djokovic serving at 6-5 down in the third set. At love 30-0 up Federer dashed back to the baseline and hit a winner through his legs that flew over the net and past Djokovic into the corner for match point. ""I think it was the greatest shot I have ever hit in my life,"" Federer told CNN. ""I have hit some good ones over all the matches I have played, but I think this one, especially under the circumstances at love 30-up and with having chance to maybe clinch the match, was amazing. ""I got a standing ovation and people went crazy -- here in New York the crowds are fantastic -- as it was the perfect shot to hit, at exactly the right time, and I can't believe I pulled it off."" Federer also revealed he is producing his best tennis because he is under less pressure than perhaps he was at the same time last year. At this stage in 2008 Federer had not won a grand slam but after winning the French Open and a historic 15th major at Wimbledon this time round he admitted he is more relaxed. ""I have a little bit less pressure to prove myself after reaching the 15 Grand Slams everyone was talking about and I also I won in Paris,"" he added. ""Getting through the pregnancy with my wife Mirka and having two beautiful daughters is also something that relaxes you for sure. But at the same time when you walk out on center court there will always be a certain type of pressure which will be there for the rest of my career. ""I just have to make sure I handle it correctly. I always play my best tennis towards the end of a tournament and I am happy that it is continued in this match after everything that has already happened this year."" Federer will play Argentina's Juan Del Potro who reached his first grand slam final after he crushed Rafael Nadal in the other semifinal.

The bodies of Kenneth McRae, 52, and his wife Jane, 55, were discovered at their home at 11.30am yesterday. Police were called to the couple's £190,000 three-storey semi-detached house in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after Mr McRae's workmates reported him missing. Tragic: A forensics team enter the house where detectives found a couple dead Neighbours told detectives the couple had not been seen for a week. West Midlands Police used a battering ram to break into the property where they discovered the couple's bodies.

United went into the match on the verge of creating history. No side had ever gone through all six group games without conceding a goal -- but a clean sheet against their Spanish visitors would have seen the Premier League giants achieve that feat. However, that dream died in the 32nd minute when Michael Carrick lost the ball to Alejandro Dominguez -- who perfectly teed up Pablo Hernandez to give Valencia the lead. With both teams already qualifying for the knockout stages, a Valencia win would have seen them go through as group winners. And they remained on course for the three points until the 63rd minute when  Anderson scored a rare goal to earn United a draw, the Brazilian midfielder reacting quickest after Park Ji-sung's shot was parried by goalkeeper Vicente Guaita. Scottish champions Glasgow Rangers finished third in the group -- and take the Europa League place in the process -- after drawing 1-1 at Bursaspor. Top scorer Kenny Miller opened the scoring for the visitors in the 19th minute when he superbly lashed home a left-footed shot from 12 yards out. But the Turkish hosts collected their first-ever Champions League point when Sercan Yildirim stabbed the ball past goalkeeper Allan McGregor with 11 minutes left. Defending champions Inter Milan had already qualified for the knockout stages, but their run of poor form continued as they were thrashed 3-0 at Werder Bremen in Group A. A Sebastian Proedl header and a Marko Arnautovic volley sealed the points for the Bundesliga side, with Claudio Pizarro adding the third near the end. A victory would have seen Rafael Benitez's side go through as group winners, but their heaviest defeat in Europe for five years allowed Tottenham to win the group on 11 points after a thrilling 3-3 draw at FC Twente. An end-to-end encounter saw Spurs go ahead when 40-year-old goalkeeper Sander Boschker completely missed a Peter Wisgerhof backpass, allowing the ball to dribble into the net. The home side levelled with a twice-taken Denny Landzaat penalty, but Jermain Defoe put the London side ahead early in the second half from close range. A Roberto Rosales header brought Twente on level terms again, but another Defoe goal looked to have sealed the points for Tottenham. However, a superb Nacer Chadli free-kick ensured the match finished all-square. The result meant that Twente qualified for the Europa League in third place but Werder Bremen go out of Europe altogether despite beating Inter. Tournament favorites Barcelona ended their Group D campaign with another victory, as a second-string side eased to a 2-0 home win over Rubin Kazan. Andreu Fontas put Barca ahead with a deflected effort and Victor Vazquez sealed the win eight minutes from time. The result means Barca finish top of the group with 14 points, while Russian side Rubin finished third to reach the Europa League. That result ensured FC Copenhagen went through in second place regardless of the outcome of their match against Panathinakos, but the Danish side went through in style -- winning 3-1 to become the first team from their nation to reach the last 16 stage. A Martin Vingard strike, a Jesper Gronkjaer penalty and a Djibril Cisse own goal secured the victory, with Cedric Kante grabbing a consolation goal for the Greek side, who finished bottom of the group to go out of Europe. German Bundesliga strugglers Schalke have saved their best form for Europe this season and they finished top of Group B after a 2-1 success at Benfica, who will now go into the Europa League. Lyon have qualified in second place, but the French side needed a late Alexandre Lacazette goal to earn a 2-2 home draw with Hapoel Tev Aviv. The Israeli side would have finished third but for conceding two minutes from time, a goal which means their European adventure is over for this season."

At the time, he had been the rising star of Swiss skiing with four World Cup wins to his name and a solitary world title -- the 2007 Super Combined. On a training run with the finish line in sight, he approached the final jump. A minor error on his part -- exacerbated by the fact he was traveling at 140 kph (87 mph) -- saw his skis flap wildly out of control as he battled to regain his balance for 40 meters in the air before landing heavily on his back. Albrecht suffered a brain injury and a bruised lung, was airlifted to hospital and placed in a coma for three weeks to give both his brain and lung the best chance of recovery. ""It was a hard time,"" he recalls. ""You have to learn your name, your age, all this stuff."" His first memory was of a hospital ceiling and it was three weeks after regaining consciousness that he once again remembered his name and the fact he had been a top skier. ""The last memory I have is from the day before. The feeling was great because the slope was in good shape and I was fast in first training and I was skiing easily. I knew that I was going to be fast in this race. Then, yeah, it was too fast!"" Albrecht is able to laugh as he retells the incident, in part helped by the fact he has no recall of the savage beating he took on the final meters of the Kitzbühel course even after watching it back on a few occasions. To him, it is as though he is watching someone else's dramatic and sudden alpine downfall, and without emotion. ""If I watch myself in Kitzbühel then I feel like it wasn't me because I don't have any memory of him. I know that he was me, I see that it was me but, for me, it was not a person. I was out of my body."" In the early weeks of his recovery from his brain trauma he did not have the strength to even feed himself. However, slowly but surely he got up to speed although he admits ""I have something [his brain] that doesn't work so good like before. So I'm always in recovery."" Today, he gets tired quicker and his temper frays more readily than prior to the accident. But remarkably, it did not end his career, rather it was a dislocated left kneecap after crashing in another training run at Lake Louise, Canada in November 2012 that finally called time on his professional career on the slopes. Amazingly, it was just a week after being released from the neurological unit that cared for him that he was back skiing despite the inherent dangers of the sport. ""The first time I was on skis, I thought 'okay, shit, this is a nice feeling, I wanna go back in the World Cup',"" he recalls. ""I got down okay [the first time] but it was not so easy because then when I see I have to make a turn and then the brain had to tell the knee what to do. Everything was in slow motion."" Slow as the process may have seemed initially, within two years, he was back on the World Cup circuit although not quite the same force he previously was. There were to be no further World Cup wins, not that he minded enormously. He still recalls the feeling of being in the start gate for that first race back: ""It was a great feeling. I was a bit nervous. Then I told me, okay, it's the first race, just ski easily. Then it was so good, the feeling was so great and I was also fast."" On his return to the sport, the doctors had warned him he might suffer headaches at altitude. He never did. He was also warned about the perilous nature of another knock to the head. ""Skiing is dangerous and it's always going to be in a little way dangerous. But if you are a skier, if you are a pro, if you're the downhill, it's not so dangerous because you know what you can do, you know how it works and, for us, Kitzbühel, when you ski it's easy."" Persuading his family, his wife in particular, of that fact was the harder part but, in the end, they knew they could not stand in the way of his desire and the thing that made him tick as a human being. The return was relatively short-lived, his knee putting pay to his ambitions to once more get to the very top of the sport. Having his career cut short was hard. ""My body told me that 'no, it's over now. You came back, you were in the World Cup again, you did it, you have you're whole life in front of you'."" Now, he runs his own clothes line, Albright, and also mentors young skiers giving the 30-year-old a new career in the sport. Part of him, the racer within, would like to be in that start gate to tackle the slope on which he was lucky to survive. But he's just happy to have had a second chance at life."

The three-month old male bonobo -- who is to be fostered by a family of German apes after being rejected by his natural mother -- was considered too young and too fragile to travel cargo class, a spokeswoman for the UK's Twycross Zoo told CNN. Instead, the tiny ape named Bili checked in for the Lufthansa flight with special travel documents -- including a fake passport in the name of ""Bili the Bonobo"" -- before taking a seat in the cabin alongside a handler from Frankfurt Zoo, who had flown over to accompany him on his unusual journey. ""He was with his keeper all the way to make him feel more comfortable and relaxed, rather than being in a crate,"" said spokeswoman Kim Riley. ""I just wish I'd been there to see the other passengers' faces."" Bonobos, which originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo, are considered particularly intelligent primates. They are the human species' closest relation in the animal world, sharing 99.6 percent of our DNA. Bili was rejected by his mother after falling ill shortly after his birth and has required extensive nursing and medical care. Zookeepers in Frankfurt hope he can bond with an adult female bonobo which has been trained to assist with hand rearing babies. The zoo's bonobo community will also play and interact with Bili, helping him to acquire social skills. Bili will spend 30 days in quarantine at the zoo before being introduced to his new family, Riley said."

The most severely damaged aircraft was thought to have been hit in the fuel line, a military official speaking on condition of anonymity said. All three aircraft -- CV-22 Ospreys -- were diverted to Entebbe, Uganda, which is not where their flights originated, the official said. Another aircraft then flew the wounded to Nairobi, Kenya, U.S. Africa Command said in a statement. The four service members were in stable condition after treatment, the statement said. Pentagon officials were trying to determine how to mount another effort to evacuate the roughly three dozen Americans in South Sudan, where they have been working for the United Nations, a senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was ""reviewing options,"" Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. ""Whatever we do it will be in coordination with the State Department,"" he added. The White House said U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed before dawn Saturday while aboard Air Force One after landing in Hawaii, then met with his national security team on the matter. The fighting has displaced as many as 100,000 people, many of whom have crossed the Nile River, he said, adding that he feared a humanitarian disaster was unfolding. South Sudanese President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting this month's violence. Tensions have been high in South Sudan since July, when Kiir dismissed Machar and the rest of the Cabinet. The move inflamed tensions between Kiir's Dinka community and Machar's Nuer community. Casualties include soldiers and number in the hundreds, the government said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Kiir on Saturday and discussed ways to halt the violence. It was Kerry's second call to Kiir since Thursday night. ""Secretary Kerry emphasized that only through leadership and political dialogue will the challenges facing South Sudan be resolved,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. The two men ""discussed the need to prevent ethnic violence, their concern for the welfare of thousands of internally displaced persons fleeing the conflict, as well as for the safety of U.S. citizens in South Sudan, and they agreed to speak again soon,"" she said. Meanwhile, the State Department issued an emergency message for U.S. citizens, calling on them to avoid the area around the airport in Bor. Limited flights were continuing from Juba International Airport. On Friday, Kerry said he was sending a special envoy -- Ambassador Donald Booth -- to the country. ""Now is the time for South Sudan's leaders to rein in armed groups under their control, immediately cease attacks on civilians, and end the chain of retributive violence between different ethnic and political groups,"" Kerry said in a statement. Saturday's violence wasn't the first this week to harm foreign troops in South Sudan. On Thursday, attackers killed two Indian army peacekeepers, wounded a third, and killed 20 of 30 civilians who were seeking refuge at the United Nations' Akobo base, the U.N. said. In a news release, the African Union called for an immediate truce. It said that the chairwoman of the AU Commission, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, was ""profoundly dismayed at the recent turn of events"" and condemned the killing of innocent civilians and U.N. peacekeepers in Bor as a war crime. South Sudan became the world's newest country when it split from Sudan in July 2011. The split happened after a 2005 peace agreement ended years of civil war between the largely Animist and Christian south and the Muslim-dominated north. The deal led to a January 2011 referendum in which people of the south voted to secede from Sudan.

They found an ancestor of the chicken mating with different males helped females produce offspring more resistant to disease and claim the findings could be applied to other animals including humans Professor David S Richardson, from the University of East Anglia, said: 'Our research has shown that females don’t need to choose between males to produce the most healthy offspring. 'Rather by mating with multiple males, they allow their internal choice mechanism to favour the most genetically different sperm. 'This could be the case in other animals - including humans, however the practicality of testing this in mammals would be very difficult, and obviously impossible in humans for ethical reasons.' Researchers studied red junglefowl using both natural matings and artificial insemination in a project with the University of Oxford, Stockholm University and Linkoping University. Professor David S Richardson, from the University of East Anglia, explained the research has shown that females don't need to choose between males to produce the most healthy offspring. Rather by mating with multiple males, they allow their internal choice mechanism to favour the most genetically different sperm They claim the effect is down to 'cryptic female choice' where an internal mechanism in the reproductive tract favours the sperm from males that are most genetically different to them. By increasing the diversity of particular genes, which help detect and fight infections, female birds can provide their offspring with better disease resistance. Researchers also claim that signals given off by the male, such as odour, could help the female subconsciously choose the best father. The findings could be important for animal breeders and conservation projects because they show that allowing multiple matings will produce the most disease resistant and genetically healthy offspring. The findings of the study could be important for animal breeders and conservation projects because they show that allowing multiple matings will produce the most disease resistant and genetically healthy offspring. Ancestors of modern chickens were studied 'To optimise the quality of offspring produced in breeding programmes we may need to make sure that females mate with multiple males and that they avoid artificial insemination, which could lead to the genetic health of bred stocks being weaker,' Professor Richardson said. 'Many breeding programmes for livestock and conservation use artificial insemination. But our research suggests that this may not produce the best quality offspring. 'This is because the effect appears to require the subconscious female assessment of the male by some cue during actual mating. 'So having correct cues during mating, perhaps the smell of the male, can affect a females’ chances of being fertilised. And the cues from different males may not work equally well on different females. This is something that needs to be explored further in various animals including humans.'"

The Marin County panel found Max Wade, 19, guilty of commercial burglary and auto theft of the $200,000 convertible. The court heard how Wade rappelled into British Motors in 2011 and stole the car while it was in the dealership for repairs. Wade was also found guilty of attempted murder and firing a gun into an occupied vehicle in an unrelated drive-by shooting of a man who was dating a girl Wade desired. The man wasn't injured. Max Wade, right, is accused of stealing celebrity chef Guy Fieri's car back in March 2011 The celebrity chef¿s bright-yellow Lamborghini was worth $800,000 and was missing for over 18 months Marin County prosecutor Yvette Martinez said Wade had stolen the yellow Lamborghini to impress the girl and was willing to kill to get her attention. Wade pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. He now faces up to 30 years in prison. Detectives testified during the trial that they found the gun used in the shooting, two assault weapons and shotgun shells, as well as climbing gear. Fieri, a star of Food Network, testified during the trial that he had never met Wade and never gave him permission to drive his car. The teen made news again last year after at least two people tried to break into Marin County's juvenile hall with sledgehammers in an unsuccessful attempt to free him. Authorities took extra measures to ensure security in the courtroom during the trial, keeping Wade tethered to a chair bolted to the floor. Max Wade, left, as he looked in his police mugshot at the time  and Eva Dedier, right, who he is charged with attempting to murder after she spurned his advances Fieri appeared in court as a witness during the case, testifying for just a few minutes to confirm that he did not know the teen nor did he give him permission to take the luxury car out of the dealership. Prosecutors allege that Wade stole the car in a ‘Mission Impossible’-style heist to impress the girl, Eva Dedier, who is now 19. Then in April 2012 he attempted to kill Dedier and her former boyfriend, Landon Wahlstrom, as they sat in Wahlstrom’s truck. That investigation led authorities to Wade's storage container in Richmond, where they found the Food Network star's stolen yellow Lamborghini. Fieri told reporters outside of court that he is relieved the ordeal is nearly over. ‘It's been a really crazy story,’ he said. During the 18 month period that the car, Fieri said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle being driven around the Bay Area He had been in Chicago filming his show ‘Dives, Diners and Drive-ins’ for the Food Network when he heard the car had been stolen. ‘I thought it was a bad joke,’ Fieri told NBC Bay Area. During the 18 month period that the car, the chef said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle. Fieri said he thought Wade’s story would make a great movie. ‘I'm sorry to see laws get broken,’ Fieri said. ‘This has so many other facets that are far more important than my car. My car is a very small portion of it. There's a bigger issue on the table.’ He said the insurance company took ownership of the car after it was found in Wade's possession at a storage unit."

Riccardo Zangelmi used 9,000 pieces to construct the 3D model of MC Escher's 'Relativity' over 15 days The print depicts a world in which there are three sources of gravity and sixteen characters who live in different 'gravity wells'. There are seven stairways, and each stairway can be used by people who belong to two different gravity wells. This means that, for example, inhabitants are depicted as climbing the stairways upside-down, but based on their own gravity source, they are climbing normally.

The piece will be on display for four months during an exhibition in Parma, Italy, dedicated to Escher, alongside his original works. Dutch artist Escher is best known for his mathematical inspired woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints. He also produced impossible architectural constructions and tessellations that often explore the theme of infinity. This isn’t the first time that he has captured the imagination of Lego artists. Two years ago, Andrew Lipson from Cambridge carefully assembled thousands of Lego bricks over many weeks to create a number of incredible Escher pieces.

'I then had to build a Lego copy of that and then distort a photograph of the result.’ MC Escher was born in Leeuwarden in the Netherlands in 1924. By the time he died in 1974 his drawings of impossible structures made him one of the most celebrated graphic artists of the 20th Century."

But an entry within this tatty pocket diary appears to offer corroboration to claims that Adolf Hitler fathered an illegitimate son. Yesterday one of former Royal Engineer Leonard Wilkes’s sons said the diary could offer the earliest written record of the story of Frenchman Jean-Marie Loret, who went to his grave believing Hitler was his father. Diarist: Former Royal Engineer Leonard Wilkes, left and right, his son Alan, 72 with his wartime diary where he details meeting a woman who claimed she had given birth to a son by Hitler The sensational entry in Mr Wilkes' wartime diary which adds weight to the claims that Hitler fathered a son Alan Wilkes came forward after reading about new information last month that adds weight to Mr Loret’s claim to have been conceived during a brief relationship between his mother and the then young German corporal during the First World War. Leonard was one of the first soldiers to land on the Normandy beaches on D-Day in June 1944. Over the following months he kept a diary as the Allies fought to liberate France and among the pages filled with neat writing in capital letters is a sensational reference to the alleged liaison between Hitler and Charlotte Lobjoie in the summer of 1917. On September 30 in 1944 Leonard, who was from Small Heath, Birmingham, wrote: ‘An interesting day today. Visited the house where Hitler stayed as a corporal in the last war, saw the woman who had a baby by him and she told us that the baby, a son, was now fighting in the French army against the Germans.’ The diary claims add weight to evidence that emerged last month that Jean-Marie Loret, right, was the lovechild of Adolf Hitler, left Jean-Marie Loret, who was born in March, 1918, grew up knowing nothing about his father, apart from the fact that he was German. It was only in the late 1950s, just before her death, that his mother, Charlotte Lobjoie, finally told him the story that was to haunt him for the rest of his life. According to her story, the relationship began in 1917. Although Hitler, then 28, was fighting the French near Seboncourt, in the northern Picardy region, he made his way to Fournes-en-Weppe, a town west of Lille, for leave. There he met Miss Lobjoie who apparently later told her son: ‘One day I was cutting hay with other women, when we saw a German soldier on the other side of the street. He had a sketch pad and seemed to be drawing. All the women found this interesting, and were curious to know what he was drawing. I was designated to approach him.’ The pair started a brief relationship and  she said Jean-Marie was conceived after a ‘tipsy’ evening in June 1917. He was born the following year. According to information from Mr Loret’s lawyer, Miss Lobjoie told her son: ‘When your father was around, which was very rarely, he liked to take me for walks in the countryside. ‘But these walks usually ended badly. In fact, your father, inspired by nature, launched into speeches which I did not really understand. He did not speak French, but solely ranted in German, talking to an imaginary audience. ‘Even if I spoke German I would not be able to follow him, as the histories of Prussia, Austria and Bavaria were not familiar to me at all, far from it. My reaction used to anger your father so much that I did not show any reaction.’ Three days later, his battalion marched on towards Brussels. He made no further reference to Miss Lobjoie or her lovechild and never mentioned it to his family on his return home from war. Leonard was married to Doris for more than 50 years and worked as a machine presser. The grandfather of five and great-grandfather of 18 died in 1991, aged 76. His son, from Ward End, Birmingham, said he discovered the diary with his brother, Gordon, 68, following the death of their mother ten years ago. Mr Wilkes, 73, said: ‘It was kept in a box. We were going to throw it out. I was shocked when I read it. My father never spoke to me about the war and, until he died. I never even knew the diary existed.’ The brothers did not think the diary would be of interest to anyone outside the family until new claims emerged in French magazine Le Point last month that Hitler may have had a son while serving as a soldier in France. Mr Loret was born in March 1918 and his mother told him about his father shortly before her death in the late 1950s. Mr Loret died in 1985, aged 67, having never been able to prove his heritage. But his lawyer, Francois Gibault, gave Le Point documents to support his claims. The lawyer said Miss Lobjoie told her son the relationship with Hitler began in 1917 when the future Nazi leader was aged 28 and fighting the French in Picardy. The pair met when Hitler travelled to the town of Fournes-in-Weppe, near Lille, for leave. According to Mr Gibault, she later told her son: ‘One day I was cutting hay with other women, when we saw a German soldier on the other side of the street. ‘He had a sketch pad and seemed to be drawing. All the women found this interesting, and were curious to know what he was drawing. I was designated to approach him.’ The pair started a brief relationship and she said Jean-Marie was conceived after a ‘tipsy’ evening in June 1917. He was born the following year. Miss Lobjoie spoke to her son about his true heritage many years after she had given him up for adoption in the 1930s to a family called Loret. Mr Loret grew up to fight the Germans in 1939 and later joined the French Resistance. Mr Loret later discovered that German officers brought envelopes of cash to Miss Lobjoie during the  Second World War. After she died, he found paintings in her attic which were signed by Hitler.

The original lawsuit, filed in 2004, was seeking $1 billion in damages. Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 employees when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into its top-floor offices in the World Trade Center's North Tower and claimed the airline had been negligent in allowing the terrorists to board the plane. This weeks agreement averts a trial scheduled for next month, which means there will be no airing of such questions as how terrorists got through security before hijacking planes on September 11, the best way to stop terrorists, whether there was any real wrongdoing and negligence and how best to preserve liberties amid such threats, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said. 'All this will remain a mystery,' he said. Howard Lutnick - the head of financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald who lost 658 employees, including in his brother, in the 9/11 attacks - visits the North Pool of the Memorial during the 10th anniversary of September 11 in 2011. Cantor Fitzgerald this week settled a damages lawsuit with American Airlines for $135 million Calling the settlement a significant conclusion after 12 years of litigation that resulted in scores of settlements and no trial involving airlines, the judge said: 'Hopefully what was achieved was a measure of justice, a measure of reparation and closure.' 'But the lives that were lost were irreparable, and being irreparable, there now are no words to describe that loss,' he added. The deal was announced by Cantor Fitzgerald attorney John Stoviak, who said money from various insurers is in escrow and ready to be paid out pending formal approval by the court at or after a January 13 hearing. Afterward, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard W. Lutnick said in a statement that the case for insurance companies 'was just another case, just another settlement, but not for us'. Lutnick, whose brother Gary Lutnick was killed in the attacks, added: 'We could never, and will never, consider it ordinary. For us, there is no way to describe this compromise with inapt words like ordinary, fair or reasonable. All we can say is that the legal formality of this matter is over.' American Airlines Flight 11 was a passenger flight that was hijacked by five al-Qaeda terrorists. It was the first plane flown into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2011, crashing into the Northern Tower, which held the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald The north tower of the World Trade Center burns after s hijacked airplane hit it September 11, 2001 in New York City. Inside the building were the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, who have sued American Airlines for damages over the attacks Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 of 1,000 people in its New York workforce when the 101st through 105th floors of its One World Trade Center headquarters were destroyed when a hijacked airplane struck the tower. - Left Boston's Logan Airport at 7.59am - Destination was Los Angeles - On board were a crew of 11 and 76 passengers - Five terrorists hijacked the plane once it was in the air - The hijackers flew the plane into the north tower of the World Trade Center at 8.46am Howard Lutnick wasn't in the office at the time. Anthoula Katsimatides, who lost her brother John Katsimatides, a bonds broker, said she was 'disheartened' to hear the case had been settled instead of going to trial. 'It would have been nice to hold people accountable over issues including security,' she said. But she wasn't upset with Cantor Fitzgerald. 'I'm so confident that they are always thinking about the best interests of their September 11 families ... there must have been a reason why they settled,' she said. Of this being the last airplane-focused case and therefore ending the chance to bring these issues up in open court, she said she was disappointed, but 'I guess we just have to live with it'. A spokesman for American Airlines, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and is part of American Airlines Group Inc., said in a statement the airline had 'vigorously defended itself in litigation brought against it by property owners and their insurers who allege that American should have done what the government could not do: prevent the terrorist attacks'. After American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center (right) another hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 175, prepares to slam into the south tower The spokesman, Sean Collins, also noted that 'the courageous crew members and passengers on Flight 77 and Flight 11 were all victims of the terrorist attacks'. The judge praised lawyers on both sides, saying he once thought a deal was impossible. He noted that some litigation from September 11, 2001, remains, including claims involving the trade center, developer Larry Silverstein, first responders and others. Cantor Fitzgerald, meanwhile, has risen dramatically from a low of about 150 employees in the months after the attacks. It now has 3,200 employees in New York and about 8,000 worldwide, including the employees of a spinoff, BGC Partners. In total, almost 3,000 people died in the 9/11 attacks, including the 227 civilians and 19 hijackers aboard the four planes."

A new wife, a World Cup win for his beloved German football team and now a new contract with the Mercedes team. Rosberg heads to his home grand prix in Germany this weekend on cloud nine -- and still leading the 2014 world championship by four points from Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. First came the wedding, as the 29-year-old married childhood sweetheart Vivian Sibold in Monaco last week. The celebrations carried on as Rosberg enjoyed a rare race free Sunday by watching Germany defeat Argentina to lift the World Cup for a fourth time. The Mercedes driver -- who had sportingly invited French Lotus driver Romain Grosjean to watch Germany defeat France in the quarterfinals after qualifying for the British Grand Prix -- plans to mark Germany's triumph with a special helmet for his homecoming race. He will race around Hockenheim with football's World Cup trophy at the centerpiece of a black, yellow and red design. Rosberg, the son of 1982 F1 world champion Keke, also goes to Germany with a multi-year contract extension in his back pocket. The former Williams racer, who joined Mercedes when the Silver Arrows returned to the sport in 2010, has signed on for an unspecified number of seasons. ""I'm looking forward to the next years together,"" said Rosberg, who has raced to six victories with the German team. ""We will keep pushing to win even more races -- and hopefully championships."" Mercedes motorsport chief Toto Wolff said: ""Nico's speed, commitment and focus have all helped to give clear direction and to drive the team forward since 2010. ""With his performances in 2014, Nico has demonstrated to the outside world what we already knew in the team; that he is one of the very top drivers in Formula One."" Rosberg made his F1 debut with Williams in 2006 but his reputation has grown at Mercedes, particularly as he proved equal to the sport's seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher during their three years as teammates. Since replacing Schumacher in 2013, Lewis Hamilton has provided another benchmark for Rosberg to measure himself against. The English 2008 world champion is generally perceived to be the quicker driver but Rosberg has shown in 2014 that he is developing into a more rounded racer. Hamilton signed a three-year contract when he joined Mercedes with the deal due to expire at the end of 2015. From junior teammates and friends, Rosberg and Hamilton are now locked in an intriguing battle for the 2014 world title. Rosberg has won three races with Hamilton, who has lost valuable points with two retirements, taking five grand prix victories as the season reaches its halfway point. After Hamilton's victory at the British Grand Prix put him back in the title hunt, Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda predicted of his Mercedes charges: ""They will fight until the end like you do not believe to be world champion."" Rosberg may already be enjoying an annus mirabilis but he still has his eye on the prize he really wants -- his first F1 world title."

But it seemed that some Brazilians retained their laid-back cool amid the scenes of upset, by continuing to sunbathe throughout. Brazilian security forces and protesters clashed in Barra da Tijuca, near Rio de Janeiro, where today the government was auctioning the massive - and potentially lucrative -  Libra offshore oil block. The government deployed more than a thousand troops around the beach front Windsor hotel where the auction will take place.

Brazilian officials are counting on the oil riches to quickly catapult the nation to developed-world status Officers cordoned off streets to prevent protesters from disrupting an event that President Dilma Rousseff has billed as a crowning achievement of an energy plan aimed at ending poverty and vaulting Brazil to the ranks of developed nations. The field was discovered in 2010, and could almost double Brazil’s oil reserves, garnering more than £100bn investment over 35 years. The protesters include members of unions representing oil workers, who have accused the government of 'selling off' and privatising Brazil's natural riches. Members have been on strike since Thursday at more than 40 oil platforms and refineries. Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, would be the sole operator of the field according to the terms. As part of the agreement more than 40 per cent of recovered oil would go to the state. Brazilian officials are counting on the oil riches to quickly catapult the nation to developed-world status. State officials are locked in arguments about how to split royalties that haven't surfaced, the Navy is buying submarines to protect the fields and left-wing protesters like those demonstrating on Monday demand that the entire industry be nationalised so Brazil doesn't share a drop of the wealth. But the technology hurdles to reaching the riches are intensely challenging, even for Petrobras, considered a world leader in offshore development.

Police were said to have fired rubber bullets into the crowds The deep-water reservoirs lie some 185 miles (300 kilometers) offshore in the Atlantic, more than a mile below the ocean's surface and under another 2.5 miles  of earth and corrosive salt. The salt beds can break loose and shear off piping, making it one of the toughest substances to drill. With a slowing economy and delays in producing that offshore oil, some say the Brazilian government will loosen rules to make them more business friendly when the next auction is held in two to three years. The New York-based Eurasia Group said in a research note that Petrobras' 'growing operational and financial constraints' along with government pressure to stoke a lagging national economy means changes are expected at the next auction.
